[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If such pair is found, it means there's a scheduling conflict, so the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no such pair is found after going through all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that you need to ensure that the format of your dates matches exactly with the pattern used in parsing. In this case, we are using 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM' as the format string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":2.965516477,"_type":"aimessage"}]
