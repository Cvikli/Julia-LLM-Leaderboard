If not, we return \"No events\". Then we sort all the events based on their start times. Afterwards, for each event (e1), we check if there are other events that overlap with e1 (e2). The function `tail` is used to get a portion of list after a certain index in Julia. If an overlap is found between e1 and e2, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, it will return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,441],"elapsed":3.574024117,"_type":"aimessage"}]
