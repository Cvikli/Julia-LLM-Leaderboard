[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Then define another function `check_conflicts` that iterates over the list of events and checks each pair for conflicts in time. Here is a solution:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction str2dt(s::AbstractString)\n    dt = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    return dt(s)\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start_i = str2dt(events[i][1])\n        finish_i = str2dt(events[i][2])\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_j = str2dt(events[j][1])\n            finish_j = str2dt(events[j][2])\n            \n            if !isnothing(start_i, finish_i) && !isnothing(start_j, finish_j) \n                if (start_i < start_j < finish_i) || (start_j < start_i < finish_j)\n                    return \"Conflict\"\n                end\n            else\n                return \"Incorrect date format in at least one event\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function converts a string to a DateTime object and checks for time overlaps among all pairs of events. If there's any overlap, it will immediately return \"Conflict\". The `isnothing` function is used to check if the date strings can be converted into DateFormat objects and are not null. If they cannot be converted or are null, then it returns an error message for incorrect date format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":3.505439256,"_type":"aimessage"}]
