Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Julia solution for the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sortedEvents = sort([parse.(DateTime, [first(e) for e in events]), parse.(DateTime, [last(e) for e in events]])...)\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        if (sortedEvents[2i] - sortedEvents[2i-1]) <= Second(5)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn the above code, we first check if there are any events. If not, we simply return \"No events\". Then we sort all start and end times of the events. We iterate over every pair of events in sorted order (with a 5 second tolerance for overlaps) and return \"Conflict\" when an overlap is found.\n\nThe `sortedEvents` array holds all event start times at index 2i-1 and all event end times at index 2i. When sorting, we sort by both the start time and end time of each event which ensures that events are sorted chronologically. \n\nWe use a 5 second tolerance for overlaps to account for rounding errors or slight discrepancies in timestamps.","status":200,"tokens":[0,325],"elapsed":2.656460817,"_type":"aimessage"}]
