Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Then it iterates over each event, comparing its start and end times with the previous event's start and end times. If any of these conditions are met (start time is before previous end time or end time is after previous start time), there is a scheduling conflict. If no conflicts are found in all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input events are correctly formatted and sorted.","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.308513607,"_type":"aimessage"}]
