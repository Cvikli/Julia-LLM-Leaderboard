[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If they do, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can call this function with a list of tuples representing event start and finish times like so:\n```julia\nevents = [(DateTime(\"2021-01-01 08:00\"), DateTime(\"2021-01-01 09:00\")), \n          (DateTime(\"2021-01-01 07:00\"), DateTime(\"2021-01-01 10:00\"))]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs \"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,355],"elapsed":2.97658746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
