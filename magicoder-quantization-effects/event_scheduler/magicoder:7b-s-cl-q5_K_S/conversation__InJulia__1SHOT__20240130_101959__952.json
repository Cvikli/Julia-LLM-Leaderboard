Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of `event_scheduler` in Julia using the DataFrames and IntervalSets packages:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\nimport IntervalSets: Interval\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    df = DataFrame(start=[DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(e[1]) for e in events], \n                   finish=[DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(e[2]) for e in events])\n\n    intervals = Interval{Date}[]\n    for i in 1:size(df, 1)\n        push!(intervals, df.start[i]:df.finish[i])\n    end\n    \n    if any(i->length(i)>1, intervals)\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function converts the start and finish times of each event into Date type, and stores them in a DataFrame. It then constructs IntervalSet from the start time to finish time of each event and checks if there are any intervals that overlap with other intervals. If there is any overlapping interval, it returns \"Conflict\", otherwise it returns \"No conflicts\".\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that the events do not last for a negative duration which could technically also be considered an overlap. \nThis function assumes that all times are in UTC without timezone information. If you have timezone information then it's better to use DateTime type instead of Date.","status":200,"tokens":[123,369],"elapsed":3.188738359,"_type":"aimessage"}]
