Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it's not, it sorts the events by their start time. Then it goes through each event and compares its start and finish times with those of all previous events. If any overlap occurs, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,244],"elapsed":2.064828297,"_type":"aimessage"}]
