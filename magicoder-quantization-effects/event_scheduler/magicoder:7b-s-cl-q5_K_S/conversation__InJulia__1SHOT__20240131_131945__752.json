If it finds any overlapping events, it returns \"Conflict\". If there are no overlapping events, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nYou can test this function by passing a list of tuples to it where each tuple contains two strings representing start and finish times. For example: \n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-01-01 10:00\", \"2022-01-01 11:00\"), \n          (\"2022-01-01 09:00\", \"2022-01-01 12:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs: Conflict\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,513],"elapsed":4.373599134,"_type":"aimessage"}]
