Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution using the Dates package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x -> DateTime(string(x[1], \" \", x[2])))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1], \" \") <= DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the list of events by their start times. Then it iterates over each event in the sorted list and checks if its start time is earlier than or equal to the end time of the previous event. If it is, it means there's a conflict between these two events and it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues with the next event.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list of events doesn't contain any invalid dates or times. Also, it assumes that all events are valid tuples where the first element is a date string in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format and the second element is also a time string in the same format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.709528091,"_type":"aimessage"}]
