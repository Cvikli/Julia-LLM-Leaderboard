Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

However, please note that this is a naive algorithm and might not be efficient on large datasets due to its time complexity of O(n^2). You may want to consider using a more efficient data structure or algorithm in such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[343,328],"elapsed":8.066121206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
