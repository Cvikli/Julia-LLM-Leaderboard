It then checks for overlapping events by comparing the start and end time of adjacent pairs of events. If any pair of events overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If all pairs are non-overlapping or there are no events at all (the length of `events` is 0), it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.264702767,"_type":"aimessage"}]
