Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of your request using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x -> DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi\")(x[1]))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        previous_event_end_time = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi\")(sorted_events[i - 1][2])\n        current_event_start_time = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi\")(sorted_events[i][1])\n        \n        if current_event_start_time <= previous_event_end_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts the events by their start time. Then it iterates over all pairs of consecutive events and checks if their start times overlap. If any pair of events has a start time that's earlier or equal to the end time of the previous event, there's an overlap and the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that all events are sorted in ascending order by their start times. If they're not, you should sort them before passing to this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":3.000033377,"_type":"aimessage"}]
