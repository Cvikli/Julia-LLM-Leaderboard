If it is, it returns a message stating that there are no events.\n\nIf there are events, it sorts them by their start times (since overlapping events would have to occur within one event, if they overlap with another). It then iterates through each event in the sorted list, comparing its end time to the start time of the next event. If these two times overlap (i.e., if the end time is greater than or equal to the start time), it means there's a conflict, so the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,344],"elapsed":2.967626625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
