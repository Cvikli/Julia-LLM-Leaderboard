Here's a function `event_scheduler` that accomplishes this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start_i = DateTime(events[i][1])\n        finish_i = DateTime(events[i][2])\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_j = DateTime(events[j][1])\n            finish_j = DateTime(events[j][2])\n            \n            if !isempty(start_i ∩ dates(start_j, finish_i)) || \n                !isempty(start_j ∩ dates(start_i, finish_j))\n                    return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the Dates package to parse the event's start and finish times into DateTime objects. Then, for every pair of events (i, j), we check if there's any overlap between their time periods. If there is an overlap, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,333],"elapsed":2.872294454,"_type":"aimessage"}]
