Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x -> DateTime(x[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1]) < DateTime(sorted_events[i - 1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts the list by start time. Then it iterates over each event and checks whether its start time is earlier than the end time of the previous event. If it is, that means there's a conflict between these two events, so it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[153,241],"elapsed":2.059364326,"_type":"aimessage"}]
