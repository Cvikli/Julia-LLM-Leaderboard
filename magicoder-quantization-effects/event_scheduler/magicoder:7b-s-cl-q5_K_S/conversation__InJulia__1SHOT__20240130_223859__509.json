If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any overlaps after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list is sorted by the start times of the events. If the list isn't sorted, you should sort it before calling this function to ensure correct results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,397],"elapsed":3.335621337,"_type":"aimessage"}]
