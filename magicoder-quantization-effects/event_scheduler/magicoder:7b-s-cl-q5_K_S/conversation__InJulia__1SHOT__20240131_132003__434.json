[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes all events have a start and end time in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format. The DateTime function from Dates package will parse these strings into DateTime objects which are comparable.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":2.787102704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
