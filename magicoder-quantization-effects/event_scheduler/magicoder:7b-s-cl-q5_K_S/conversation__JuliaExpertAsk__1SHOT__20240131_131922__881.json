Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's built-in sorting and comparison functions. Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    times = map(x -> (DateTime(split(x[1], ' ')[1]), DateTime(split(x[2], ' ')[1])), events)\n    sorted_times = sort!(times, by=first)\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_times)\n        if sorted_times[i][1] < sorted_times[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". \n\nIt then parses each event's start and finish times into DateTime objects, sorts them by time, and stores them in `sorted_times`.\n\nThen, it checks for conflicts in the sorted list: if any event starts before the previous one ends, there's a conflict. If no such event is found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,287],"elapsed":2.432985971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
