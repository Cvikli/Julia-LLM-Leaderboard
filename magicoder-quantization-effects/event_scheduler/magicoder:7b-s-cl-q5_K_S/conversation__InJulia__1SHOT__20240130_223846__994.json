[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list of events is sorted by start time. If the events are not sorted, you may need to sort them before calling `event_scheduler`.","status":200,"tokens":[123,359],"elapsed":3.044934263,"_type":"aimessage"}]
