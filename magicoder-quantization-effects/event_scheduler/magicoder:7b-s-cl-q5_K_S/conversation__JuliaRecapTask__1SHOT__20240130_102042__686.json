[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The `Date` type in `Dates` represents a date, and `DateTime` type in `Dates` represents both a date and time. To check for overlapping events you will need to compare the start times of two events to see if they overlap, then do the same for the end times to see if there is an overlap.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}, 1})\n    # If no events return \"No events\"\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        event1_start = events[i][1]\n        event1_end = events[i][2]\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            event2_start = events[j][1]\n            event2_end = events[j][2]\n            \n            # Check if the start of one event is after the end of the other,\n            # If true there are no conflicts.\n            if event1_start >= event2_end || event2_start >= event1_end \n                continue\n            else\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each pair of events, checking if their start and end times overlap. If an overlap is found then it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If there are no overlapping events, after checking all pairs the function will return \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it will also correctly return \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":3.599645226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
