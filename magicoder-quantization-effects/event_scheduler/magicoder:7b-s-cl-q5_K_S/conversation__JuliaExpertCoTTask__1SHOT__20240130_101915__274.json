Then you can compare each event's start and end times with every other event's start and end times to check for any overlapping events. Here is a function that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # If there are no events, return \"No events\"\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        evt1 = events[i]\n        start_time1 = DateTime(evt1[1], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n        finish_time1 = DateTime(evt1[2], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            evt2 = events[j]\n            start_time2 = DateTime(evt2[1], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n            finish_time2 = DateTime(evt2[2], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n            \n            # If the start time of one event is less than or equal to the end time of the other and vice versa, there's a conflict\n            if (start_time1 <= finish_time2) || (start_time2 <= finish_time1)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If no conflicts were found in the for loop, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nFor example, if you call `event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])`, the function should return \"Conflict\" because the first event ends after the second one starts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,492],"elapsed":4.296894222,"_type":"aimessage"}]
