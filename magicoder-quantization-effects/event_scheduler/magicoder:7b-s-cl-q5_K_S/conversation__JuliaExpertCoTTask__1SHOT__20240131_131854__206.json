Then you can iterate through each event and check if there are any events that overlap with it. If an overlap is found, return \"Conflict\". Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort([Date(event[1]) => Date(event[2]) for event in events], by=first)\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if overlap(first(sorted_events), last(sorted_events)) && overlap(first(sorted_events), first(sorted_events[i]))\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction overlap(start1, stop1)\n    start2 = DateTime(start1.value - 1)\n    stop2 = DateTime(stop1.value + 1)\n    \n    if (start1 <= stop2 && stop1 >= start2) || (start2 <= stop1 && stop2 >= start1)\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis solution works by first sorting the events by their start times. Then it checks for overlaps between each event and every other event that comes after it in the sorted list. The `overlap` function checks if two intervals overlap by checking if either start time is before the stop time of the other, or vice versa. If an overlap is found, \"Conflict\" is returned. If no overlapping events are found, \"No conflicts\" is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,389],"elapsed":3.361511196,"_type":"aimessage"}]
