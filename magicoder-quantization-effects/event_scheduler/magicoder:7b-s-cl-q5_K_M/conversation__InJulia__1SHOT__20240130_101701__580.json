[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can implement this with Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x->DateTime(x[1]))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        current_event_start = DateTime(sorted_events[i][1])\n        previous_event_end = DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2])\n        \n        if current_event_start < previous_event_end\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first sort the list of events by their start time. Then for each event, we check if its start time is before the end time of the previous event. If it is, that means there is an overlap in schedules and we immediately return \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all events, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-01-01 10:00\", \"2022-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2022-01-01 12:00\", \"2022-01-01 13:00\")]\nprint(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs \"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[123,360],"elapsed":3.189779918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
