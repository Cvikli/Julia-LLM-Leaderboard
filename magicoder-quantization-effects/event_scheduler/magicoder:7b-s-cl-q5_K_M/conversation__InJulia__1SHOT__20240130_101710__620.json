[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse dates from strings to DateTime format\n    events = [DateTime.(split(e[1], 'T')[end]) => DateTime.(split(e[2], 'T')[end]) for e in events]\n    \n    sort!(events, by=first)  # organize events based on start times\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        if events[i][2] > events[i+1][1]  # if current event's finish time is later than the next event's start time, there's a conflict\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis code will first check if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it proceeds to parse each tuple into separate start and finish times using Dates package and then sorts them based on their start time. The loop checks for any overlapping events by checking if a current event's finish time is later than the next event's start time. If such case arises, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If there are no conflicts after checking all pairs of consecutive events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":3.001806785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
