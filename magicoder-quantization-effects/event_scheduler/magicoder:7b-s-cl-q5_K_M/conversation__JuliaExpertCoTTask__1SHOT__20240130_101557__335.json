Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If not, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the events by their start times, so that they are in order of increasing start time. Then it checks for each event if its start time is before the end time of the previous event. If such an overlap occurs, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":2.287064829,"_type":"aimessage"}]
