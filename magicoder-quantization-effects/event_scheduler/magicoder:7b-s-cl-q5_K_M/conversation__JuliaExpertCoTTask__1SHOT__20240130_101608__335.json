Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        starti = DateTime(events[i][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        finishi = DateTime(events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            startj = DateTime(events[j][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            finishj = DateTime(events[j][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            \n            if !isempty(intersect(starti:minute(Minute(1)):finishi, startj:minute(Minute(1)):finishj))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe `event_scheduler` function iterates over each event in the provided list of events. For each event, it finds the start and finish times and checks for any overlap with other events by using a range that covers both start time and finish time for every pair of events. If there is an overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIn order to use this function, you can pass a list of events as a parameter like in the example:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":3.800322268,"_type":"aimessage"}]
