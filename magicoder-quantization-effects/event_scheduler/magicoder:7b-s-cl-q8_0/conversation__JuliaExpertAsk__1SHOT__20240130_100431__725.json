Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events; by = x -> (x[1], x[2]))\n\n    last_event = sorted_events[1]\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if last_event[2] > sorted_events[i][1] # Event overlaps\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        \n        last_event = sorted_events[i]\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the list of events is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\". We then sort the events by their start times and end times (in case they are not sorted properly).\n\nWe then iterate through the sorted list of events starting from the second event. For each event, we compare its start time with the end time of the previous event. If they overlap, we return \"Conflict\". If they don't overlap, we update `last_event` to be the current event.\n\nAfter iterating through all the events without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\" which indicates that there are no overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,293],"elapsed":3.327084837,"_type":"aimessage"}]
