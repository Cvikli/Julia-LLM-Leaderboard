Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem can be solved by using the Dates package in Julia. Here is a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i = 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start1, finish1 = DateTime.(split.(first.(events[i]), ' ')) .|> x -> Dates.DateTime(x, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        start2, finish2 = DateTime.(split.(first.(events[i+1]), ' ')) .|> x -> Dates.DateTime(x, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        if (start1 < start2) && (finish1 > start2) || (start2 < start1) && (finish2 > start1)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, then for each pair of consecutive events, it compares their start and finish times to check for any overlapping intervals. If such an interval is found, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlapping intervals are found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, the function finally returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIn this code, DateTime type conversion is done by splitting the event's start and finish time using ' ' (space) as a delimiter and then creating DateTime objects from these split strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":4.011222535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
