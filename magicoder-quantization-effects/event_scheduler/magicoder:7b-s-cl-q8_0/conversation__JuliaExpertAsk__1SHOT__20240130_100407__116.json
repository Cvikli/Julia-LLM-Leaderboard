Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution that uses the built-in `bisect` library to efficiently search through the sorted list of event times:\n\n```python\nfrom bisect import insort_left, bisect_right\nimport datetime as dt\n\ndef parse_time(t):\n    return dt.datetime.strptime(t, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    time_list = sorted([parse_time(e[0]) for e in events] + [parse_time(e[1]) for e in events])\n    event_bounds = []\n    \n    for start, end in zip(time_list[::2], time_list[1::2]):\n        idx = bisect_right(event_bounds, (start, 0))\n        if idx == len(event_bounds) or (idx < len(event_bounds) and event_bounds[idx][0] != start):\n            insort_left(event_bounds, (start, 1))\n        \n        idx = bisect_right(event_bounds, (end, 0))\n        if idx == len(event_bounds) or (idx < len(event_bounds) and event_bounds[idx][0] != end):\n            insort_left(event_bounds, (end, -1))\n        \n    for i in range(len(event_bounds) - 1):\n        if event_bounds[i][1] == 1 and event_bounds[i + 1][1] == -1:\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nThis function first parses the time strings into datetime objects. It then sorts this list of times, inserting each start and end time twice (once for each event they represent). This sorted list is used to track whether any given time is in between two events (1), at the start of an event (-1) or not part of any event (0).\n\nIn the next step, for every event, it checks if there's a conflicting event by looking right and left from its start/end times. If it finds a conflict, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it gets through all events without finding a conflict, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,525],"elapsed":6.02367738,"_type":"aimessage"}]
