Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, you need to import the necessary package. Then, define your function `event_scheduler` and convert the input list into a DateTime format for easier comparison of event times.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    dateTimes = map(x -> (DateTime(x[1]), DateTime(x[2])), events) \n    sorted_times = sort!(dateTimes, by=first)\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_times)\n        if sorted_times[i][1] < sorted_times[i-1][2] # If next event starts before previous one ends\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the input list is empty, and if it's not, then it sorts the events based on their starting times. Then for each pair of successive events (i.e., `sorted_times[i]` and `sorted_times[i-1]`), it checks if the next event starts before the previous one ends. If any such pair is found, the function returns \"Conflict\", otherwise it returns \"No conflicts\".\n  \nYou can run this function with your provided data as follows:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":4.477503758,"_type":"aimessage"}]
