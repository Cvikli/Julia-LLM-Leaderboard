Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=first)\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if second(sorted_events[i-1]) > first(sorted_events[i])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function sorts the events based on their start times, then checks for any overlaps by comparing each event's end time with the next event's start time. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If all events are non-overlapping, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: You may need to parse your strings into DateTime format before running this function. This can be done using the `DateTime` function from the Dates package.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":2.620633934,"_type":"aimessage"}]
