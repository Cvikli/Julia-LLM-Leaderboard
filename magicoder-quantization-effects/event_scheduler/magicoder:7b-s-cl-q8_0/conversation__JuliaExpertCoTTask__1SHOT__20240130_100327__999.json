Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia using the Dates.jl package for parsing date/time strings and comparing their time intervals:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=first) # Sorting the events in ascending order based on start time.\n    \n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        start_i = DateTime(sorted_events[i][1])\n        finish_i = DateTime(sorted_events[i][2])\n        \n        next_start_j = DateTime(sorted_events[i+1][1])\n        \n        if start_i < next_start_j # If the start time of current event is less than next event's start time.\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether there are any events in the input list, if not it returns `\"No events\"`. If there are, it sorts the events based on their starting times and then iterates over them. It compares each event's start time to the next event's start time; if they overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input is always a list of tuples where every tuple has two strings representing the start and finish times. If you need to handle other possible inputs, you would need to add error handling code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,362],"elapsed":4.16306844,"_type":"aimessage"}]
