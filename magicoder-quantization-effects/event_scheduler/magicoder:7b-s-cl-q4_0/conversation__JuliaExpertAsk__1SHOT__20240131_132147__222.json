Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Julia's built-in DateTime type from the Dates package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        evt1 = DateTime(string(events[i][1])*\"T\", \"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM\")\n        evt2 = DateTime(string(events[i+1][1])*\"T\", \"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM\")\n        \n        if (evt1 < events[i+1][2] && evt2 > events[i][2]) || (evt1 >= events[i][2] && evt2 <= events[i][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this function, we convert each event time from string to DateTime type. Then, for every pair of events (evt1 and evt2), if there's any overlap in the start or finish times, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlapping found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the event times are sorted.","status":200,"tokens":[153,298],"elapsed":2.29363539,"_type":"aimessage"}]
