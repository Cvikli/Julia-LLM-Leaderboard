Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using the `datetime` module:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    # Check if there are no events\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    for i in range(len(events)):\n        start1, end1 = map(datetime.strptime, events[i], ['%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'])\n        \n        for j in range(i+1, len(events)):\n            start2, end2 = map(datetime.strptime, events[j], ['%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'])\n            \n            # If any two events overlap in time\n            if (start1 < end2 and start2 < end1): \n                return \"Conflict\"\n                \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nThis function iterates over the list of events, for each event it compares with every other event. If there is any overlap between two events, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all possible pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input times are in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format and that the list of events is not empty.","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":2.137524736,"_type":"aimessage"}]
