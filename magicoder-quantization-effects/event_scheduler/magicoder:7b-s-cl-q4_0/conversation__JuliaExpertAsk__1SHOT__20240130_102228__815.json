Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then iterates through the sorted list, comparing each event's finish time with the start time of the next event. If there is an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlapping events are found after going through all the events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: This function assumes that all dates and times provided in your input adhere to the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. The `Dates` package is used for parsing these strings into DateTime objects.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":2.800360166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
