Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using the built-in `bisect` module:\n\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_times = []\n    \n    for event in events:\n        start, end = map(lambda x: datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), event)\n        bisect.insort(sorted_times, (start, 1))\n        bisect.insort(sorted_times, (end, -1))\n        \n    for i in range(len(sorted_times)-1):\n        if sorted_times[i][1] == 1 and sorted_times[i+1][1] == -1:\n            return \"Conflict\"\n            \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nIn the above Python solution, we first convert each event start and end times into a datetime object. Then, we insert those times (both the start and end) to `sorted_times` list while maintaining their original order and sign (start = 1, end = -1).\n\nThen for every pair of adjacent events in `sorted_times`, if they are both starts or both ends, it means there is a conflict. If we haven't found any conflicts after checking all pairs, then there are no conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[153,314],"elapsed":2.419140292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
