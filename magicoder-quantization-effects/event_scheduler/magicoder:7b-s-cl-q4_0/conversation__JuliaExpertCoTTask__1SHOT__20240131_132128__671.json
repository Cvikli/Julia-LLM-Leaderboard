Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Then, you can easily compare these dates to find overlapping events.\n\nHere's a possible solution using the Dates package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start_time = Date(events[i][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MI\")\n        finish_time = Date(events[i][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MI\")\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            if start_time < Date(events[j][2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MI\") && finish_time > Date(events[j][1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MI\")\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nYou can call the function with your data as follows: \n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each event in the list and checking if it overlaps with any other events. If it does, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't overlap with any of the other events, it continues to check the rest of the list. If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,424],"elapsed":3.270309228,"_type":"aimessage"}]
