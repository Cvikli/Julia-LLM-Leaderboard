Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x->DateTime(first(x), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), rev=true)\n  \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(first(sorted_events[i]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") > DateTime(last(sorted_events[i - 1]), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n  \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function sorts the events by finish time in descending order, then checks if any event's start time is after the previous event's finish time. If it finds such an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, it finally returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nThis solution assumes that the input list of events will not be empty and all times will follow the 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM' format as stated in your problem.","status":200,"tokens":[0,281],"elapsed":2.125308629,"_type":"aimessage"}]
