Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python solution using `datetime` module:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return 'No events'\n    \n    for i in range(len(events)):\n        start1, end1 = map(dt.strptime, events[i], ['%Y-%m-%d %H:%M']*2)\n        \n        for j in range(i+1, len(events)):\n            start2, end2 = map(dt.strptime, events[j], ['%Y-%m-%d %H:%M']*2)\n            \n            if (start1 < end2 and start2 < end1):\n                return 'Conflict'\n    \n    return 'No conflicts'\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns 'No events'. Then it iterates over each event in the list and for each event, it compares it with every other event that comes after it. If any two events overlap in time (i.e., their start times are before the end time of the other one and vice versa), it immediately returns 'Conflict' because there is a conflict between these two events. If no conflicts are found, it returns 'No conflicts'.\n\nThis function assumes that all dates and times are valid and correctly formatted as per the input format ('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'). It does not check for any invalid or incorrect data.","status":200,"tokens":[0,336],"elapsed":2.495473353,"_type":"aimessage"}]
