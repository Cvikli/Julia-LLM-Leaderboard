You will need to use the `DateTime` type from Dates package to parse the event start and end times. Here is an example of how this function could look:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        a = DateTime(events[i][1])\n        b = DateTime(events[i][2])\n\n        c = DateTime(events[i+1][1])\n        d = DateTime(events[i+1][2])\n\n        if (a <= c && b >= c) || (a <= d && b >= d) || (c <= a && d >= a) || (c <= b && d >= b) \n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through every pair of events in the list and checks if there's any overlap between them. If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it doesn't find any overlap after checking all pairs, it then returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,297],"elapsed":2.290556071,"_type":"aimessage"}]
