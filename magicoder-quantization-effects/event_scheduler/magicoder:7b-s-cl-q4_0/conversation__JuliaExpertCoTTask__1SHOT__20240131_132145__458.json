Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using Julia's built-in DateTime type and the sort function. Here is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort([DateTime(ev[1]) => DateTime(ev[2]) for ev in events], by=first)\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if !(sorted_events[i-1][2] <= sorted_events[i][1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function sorts the events by their start times and then checks for any overlapping events. If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all pairs of adjacent events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can call this function with your example data like so:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,314],"elapsed":2.408557194,"_type":"aimessage"}]
