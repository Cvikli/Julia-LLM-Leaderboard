Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using the `dateutil` library:\n\n```python\nfrom dateutil import parser\nimport datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:  # If list is empty\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    for i in range(len(events)):\n        start1 = parser.parse(events[i][0])\n        end1 = parser.parse(events[i][1])\n        \n        for j in range(i+1, len(events)):\n            start2 = parser.parse(events[j][0])\n            end2 = parser.parse(events[j][1])\n            \n            # Check if events overlap in time\n            if (start1 <= end2) and (start2 <= end1): \n                return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nThe function works by iterating over each event, checking for any overlaps with the subsequent events. If it finds an overlap, it returns 'Conflict'. If no overlaps are found after checking all possible pairs of events, it returns 'No conflicts'. It also checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" in that case.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input format for the times is 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' (as specified). If this assumption doesn't hold, you may need to modify the parsing code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":2.386556083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
