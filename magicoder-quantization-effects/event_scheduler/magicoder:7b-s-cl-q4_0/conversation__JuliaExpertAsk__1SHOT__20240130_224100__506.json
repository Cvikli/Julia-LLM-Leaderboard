Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using the `datetime` module:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_events = sorted([(datetime.strptime(event[0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), \n                             datetime.strptime(event[1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')) for event in events])\n    \n    for i in range(len(sorted_events)-1):\n        if sorted_events[i+1][0] < sorted_events[i][1]:  # If the start of next event is before end of current event\n            return \"Conflict\"\n            \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThis function first checks if there are no events. If not, it sorts the list of events by their start and finish times. It then iterates over the sorted list, checking for any scheduling conflicts. If a conflict is found (i.e., if the start time of the next event is before the end time of the current event), it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that all events are valid i.e., their start and finish times are in correct format and they don't overlap with themselves. If you want to validate the input or handle edge cases differently, you can modify this code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[153,320],"elapsed":2.408436106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
