[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all possible pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list of events is sorted in ascending order based on their start times. If the events are not sorted, you may want to sort them before running `event_scheduler`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.210277403,"_type":"aimessage"}]
