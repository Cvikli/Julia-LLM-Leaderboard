Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x -> DateTime(string(x[1], \" \", x[2])))\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        prev_event = sorted_events[i-1]\n        curr_event = sorted_events[i]\n        \n        if DateTime(curr_event[1]) < DateTime(prev_event[2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". \n\nThen, it sorts the array of events by their start times. This way, all overlapping events are grouped together and we can easily check for conflicts. \n\nThe function then iterates through each pair of consecutive events in the sorted list. If the current event's start time is earlier than the previous event's end time, it means there's a conflict. In this case, the function returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,316],"elapsed":3.035034103,"_type":"aimessage"}]
