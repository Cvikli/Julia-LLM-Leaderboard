If it is, we return \"No events\". \n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive events in the list, we parse their start and finish times into DateTime objects. We then compare these to see if there's any overlap between them: if `start1` <= `finish2` and `start2` <= `finish1`, that means they overlap, so we return \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":2.844822939,"_type":"aimessage"}]
