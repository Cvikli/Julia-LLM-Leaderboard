Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of a solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort([parse(DateTime, x[1]) => parse(DateTime, x[2]) for x in events], by = first)\n    \n    last_event = first(sorted_events)\n\n    for (start, finish) in sorted_events\n        if start < last_event.second && finish > last_event.first\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        last_event = (start, min(last_event.second, finish))\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check if the list of events is empty and return a message accordingly. We then sort the list of tuples based on their start times. Then for each event, we compare it to the previous event. If the new event starts before the previous one ends, it means there's an overlap between them, so we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, we update our last event to be the current event.\n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all events, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":2.761064682,"_type":"aimessage"}]
