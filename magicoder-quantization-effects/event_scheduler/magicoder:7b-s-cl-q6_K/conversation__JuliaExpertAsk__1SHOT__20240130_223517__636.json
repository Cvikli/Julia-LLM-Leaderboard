Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of your request using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x -> x[1])  # Sort the events based on start time\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        prev_event = sorted_events[i-1]\n        current_event = sorted_events[i]\n        \n        if current_event[1] < DateTime(current_event[2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"  # If no conflict found, return this string\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts the list based on start time. Then it iterates over each event in the sorted list and checks if the current event's start time is earlier than its finish time (which means it has no overlap with any previous event). If it finds an event that violates this condition, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it goes through all events without finding any conflict, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,282],"elapsed":2.697015544,"_type":"aimessage"}]
