Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using Julia programming language. We will use the Dates package to parse dates and DateTime type for comparison.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=first) # Sort the events based on start time\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        current_event = sorted_events[i]\n        previous_event = sorted_events[i-1]\n        \n        if DateTime(current_event[1]) < DateTime(previous_event[2]) # If the start of the current event is before the end of the previous one, there's a conflict\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first checking if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the list of events based on their start times. Then, for each event in the sorted list (except the first one), it checks if the start time of the current event is before the end time of the previous one. If it is, there's a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, no conflicts exist and the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,306],"elapsed":2.969278716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
