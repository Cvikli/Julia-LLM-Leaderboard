Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution to your problem using the `datetime` module.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # Sort by start time and then finish time.\n    \n    for i in range(len(sorted_events) - 1):\n        if datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i][0], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\") < datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i+1][1], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\"): # If the start of next event is before the finish time of current event, then there's a conflict.\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nYou can call this function with your data as follows:\n\n```python\nprint(event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]))\n```\n\nThis function works by first sorting the events in ascending order based on start time and then finish time. It then checks if the start of any event is before the end of the previous event, which would indicate a conflict. If such an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\", otherwise it returns \"No conflicts\". If there are no events, it simply returns \"No events\".\n\nThis solution assumes that all times are given in 24-hour format and does not account for situations where the start time of an event might be after its end time. However, since you mentioned dates in your data, I'm assuming this is not a problem.","status":200,"tokens":[0,439],"elapsed":4.328554723,"_type":"aimessage"}]
