[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns \"No events\". Then, it sorts the events in ascending order based on their start and finish times. After sorting, it iterates through each event starting from the second one (since we've already checked the first one against nothing). For each event, if its start time is less than the end time of the previous event, there's a conflict. In this case, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,302],"elapsed":2.895742072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
