It does this by comparing the start time of one event with all subsequent events' finish times, and vice versa. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe `DateTime` function from Dates package is used to convert string representations of dates into DateTime objects that can be compared for overlapping time intervals. The `:Minute(1)` argument in the range indicates we want to check for overlaps at every minute level. If there's no overlap, the range will be empty and the `isempty` function will return true.","status":200,"tokens":[0,440],"elapsed":4.311775603,"_type":"aimessage"}]
