[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Then it checks whether there's an overlap between these events by comparing the start and finish times of two consecutive events. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that `ZonedDateTime` is used here to handle time zones if your date-time data includes them.","status":200,"tokens":[0,351],"elapsed":3.431680321,"_type":"aimessage"}]
