Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=first)\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if first(sorted_events[i]) < last(sorted_events[i-1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function sorts the events by their start time and then checks for any overlapping events. If an event starts before its preceding event ends, it means there's a conflict so the function returns \"Conflict\". If no such event is found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":1.871485442,"_type":"aimessage"}]
