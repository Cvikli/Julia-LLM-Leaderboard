If it's not, it sorts the array of tuples by date and time. Then, for each event in the sorted list, it checks if the current event has a start date before or at the same date as the previous one. If so, there is a conflict. It also checks if the current event has a start time that's earlier than or equal to the end time of the previous event on the same day, which also indicates a conflict. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,434],"elapsed":4.185716665,"_type":"aimessage"}]
