Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution using the Dates package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x -> DateTime(x[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1]) < DateTime(sorted_events[i - 1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the array of events by their start times. After sorting, it iterates through the sorted array and checks for any overlapping events (events that have a start time earlier than the end time of the previous event). If such an overlap is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.554980099,"_type":"aimessage"}]
