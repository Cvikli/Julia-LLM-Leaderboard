[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it's not, it sorts the events based on their start time and then iterates through them. For each event, it checks whether its start time comes before or at the same time as the end time of the previous event. If that's the case, there's a conflict and it immediately returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, there are no conflicts and it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2021-09-15 08:00\", \"2021-09-15 09:30\"), (\"2021-09-15 09:45\", \"2021-09-15 11:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Outputs: No conflicts\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.63629658,"_type":"aimessage"}]
