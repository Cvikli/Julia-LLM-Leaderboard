[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the input list `events` to be sorted by start times. If the list of events isn't sorted, you may need to sort it before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.508872963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
