Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of `event_scheduler` using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=first)\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if timeoverlaps(sorted_events[i-1], sorted_events[i])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction timeoverlaps(e1, e2)\n    start_e1 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    finish_e1 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    start_e2 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    finish_e2 = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    \n    s1, f1 = parse.(Date, (start_e1, finish_e1), e1)\n    s2, f2 = parse.(Date, (start_e2, finish_e2), e2)\n    \n    return !(f1 < s2 || f2 < s1)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it sorts the events by their start time and then iterates over them checking for any overlap with the previous event. The `timeoverlaps` helper function parses the dates from strings and compares their times to check for overlap.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input list of tuples is correctly formatted, i.e., each tuple has exactly two elements (start and finish time). If there can be more or less elements in a tuple, you'll need to adjust the parsing accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":4.060714101,"_type":"aimessage"}]
