The function first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" in that case. Then it loops over each event, extracts its start time and finish time, and compares them with every other event's start and finish times. If any event's start or finish time overlaps with another event's start or finish time, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". After checking all pairs of events for conflicts, if no conflict is found, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[343,393],"elapsed":5.89852452,"_type":"aimessage"}]
