Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

The function `event_scheduler` uses a loop to compare each event with the following events, checking if their start times are before or at the end of each other's finish time. If any conflict found, it returns \"Conflict\", otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\" \n    else \n        for (start1, finish1) in events\n            start_time1 = DateTime(start1, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            finish_time1 = DateTime(finish1, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            \n            for (start2, finish2) in events[events .!= (start1, finish1)] \n                start_time2 = DateTime(start2, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n                finish_time2 = DateTime(finish2, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n                \n                if start_time2 < finish_time1 && start_time1 < finish_time2 \n                    return \"Conflict\"\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    \n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function works by first checking if the list is empty, if so it returns \"No events\". Then, for each event in the list (starting from the first one), it checks if this event's start time is before or at the finish time of any subsequent event. If there is a conflict it immediately returns \"Conflict\", otherwise after checking all possible conflicts with all other events it finally returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nFor example, when running `event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])`, it will return \"Conflict\" because the second event's start time is at or after the first one's finish time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,514],"elapsed":5.079997209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
