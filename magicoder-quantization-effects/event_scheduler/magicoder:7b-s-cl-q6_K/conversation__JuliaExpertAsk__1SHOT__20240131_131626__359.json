Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If an overlap is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflict is detected after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,323],"elapsed":3.110931209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
