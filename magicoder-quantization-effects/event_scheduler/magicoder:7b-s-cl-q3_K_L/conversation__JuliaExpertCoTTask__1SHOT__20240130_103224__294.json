Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, you need to convert the time strings into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates.DateTime` constructor, then sort these events by their start times and compare each pair of subsequent events for overlapping.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = map(t -> (Dates.DateTime.(t[1]), Dates.DateTime.(t[2])), sort!(collect(events); by=first))\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i - 1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first sorts the events by their start times, then iterates over these events checking for any overlap. If it finds an event that starts before the previous event's finish time, there is a conflict and it returns \"Conflict\". If all events are non-overlapping, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can test this function with your example like:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\n@show event_scheduler(events)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,359],"elapsed":2.935708605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
