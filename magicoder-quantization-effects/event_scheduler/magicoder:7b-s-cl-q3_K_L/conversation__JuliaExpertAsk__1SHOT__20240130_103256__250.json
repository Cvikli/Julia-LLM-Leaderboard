Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    else\n        sorted = sort(events, by=x -> (parse(DateTime, first(x)), last(x)))\n        \n        for i in 2:length(sorted)\n            if parse(DateTime, first(sorted[i])) < parse(DateTime, last(sorted[i-1]))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function sorts the events by start time and then checks if any event starts before the previous event ends.
