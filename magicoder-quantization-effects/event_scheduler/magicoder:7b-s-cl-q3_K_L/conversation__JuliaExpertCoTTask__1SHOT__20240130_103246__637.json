If it's not, it proceeds to parse the start and finish times into DateTime objects and stores them in a DataFrame (named df). It then loops through each event with every subsequent one, checking for any overlapping times using the .> and .< functions that return true if the first argument is greater or less than, respectively, the second. If it finds any such pair of events, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,432],"elapsed":3.551196944,"_type":"aimessage"}]
