[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If there is an overlap in times, the function will return \"Conflict\". Here's how you might do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        start = events[i][1] |> DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") |> parse\n        finish = events[i][2] |> DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") |> parse\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            other_start = events[j][1] |> DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") |> parse\n            other_finish = events[j][2] |> DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") |> parse\n            \n            if finish >= other_start && start <= other_finish\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check if the input list is empty. If it's not, then for each event (i), we compare its finish time with every other event's start time and its start time with every other event's finish time. If any overlap in times is found, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[123,385],"elapsed":3.099240931,"_type":"aimessage"}]
