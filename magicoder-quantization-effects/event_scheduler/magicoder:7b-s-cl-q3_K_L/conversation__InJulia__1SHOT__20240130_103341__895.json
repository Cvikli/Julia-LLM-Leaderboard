[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns 'No events'. Otherwise, it sorts the events based on their start time, and then checks for any overlapping events by comparing the end time of each event with the start time of the next one. If there's a conflict (i.e., an end time from one event overlaps with a start time from another), it returns 'Conflict'. \n\nPlease note that this function assumes the input date format is in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM', and it does not handle cases where the input might have some other format or has non-date characters. Also, this function can be further optimized by only sorting once and using two pointers to compare current event with previous events (which avoids having to iterate over all of the sorted events), but that's beyond the scope of this question.","status":200,"tokens":[0,394],"elapsed":3.204829128,"_type":"aimessage"}]
