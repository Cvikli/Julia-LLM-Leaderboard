[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Then, it compares the start and finish times of consecutive events to see if there is any overlap. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all possible pairs of consecutive events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\nPlease note that this function assumes dates and time are in the same event and the list does not contain invalid date/time formats or out-of-order events. \n\nYou can test this with the following code:\n```julia\nevents = [\"2021-01-01 08:00\", \"2021-01-01 10:00\", \"2021-01-01 09:00\"]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs \"No conflicts\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":3.040817748,"_type":"aimessage"}]
