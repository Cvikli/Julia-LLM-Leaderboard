Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start1 = DateTime(events[i][1], \"yy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        finish1 = DateTime(events[i][2], \"yy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start2 = DateTime(events[j][1], \"yy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            finish2 = DateTime(events[j][2], \"yy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            \n            if intersects(start1, finish1, start2, finish2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `event_scheduler`, we are first checking whether the list of events is empty. If it is, we return `\"No events\"`. Then for each pair of consecutive events (`(i, j)`), we convert their start and end times into DateTime format and check if they intersect with any other events using the function `intersects`. If there's an overlap, we return \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all pairs, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the event list only contains tuples of start and end times in the 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format.","status":200,"tokens":[0,379],"elapsed":3.018608139,"_type":"aimessage"}]
