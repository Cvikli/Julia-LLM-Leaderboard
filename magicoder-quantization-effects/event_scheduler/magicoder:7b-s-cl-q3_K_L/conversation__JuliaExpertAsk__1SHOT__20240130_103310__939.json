Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve this problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = x -> (x[1], x[2])) # Sort the events by start time\n    \n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if Date(sorted_events[i][2]) > Date(sorted_events[i+1][1]) # If the finish of one event is later than start of next\n            return \"Conflict\" # There's a conflict\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\" \nend\n```\nThis function first checks if there are any events. If not, it returns \"No events\". Then it sorts the events by their start and finish times. After that, it iterates over all the pairs of consecutive events in sorted order. If it finds an event whose end time is later than the start time of the next event (i.e., they overlap), it immediately returns \"Conflict\" since there's a conflict among the events at this point. If no conflict is found after checking all the pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,284],"elapsed":2.28624847,"_type":"aimessage"}]
