X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

We could use the `Date` function from the `Dates` standard library in order to do that. Here's a solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # check for empty list\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # convert strings to dates\n    dates = [Date(e[1], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for e in events]\n  \n    # sort the dates\n    sort!(dates)\n  \n    # iterate through the sorted list of dates\n    for i in 2:length(dates)\n        if dates[i - 1].value + Dates.Minute(30) >= dates[i].value\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe function `event_scheduler` first checks if the list of events is empty, and if it is, returns a string saying that there are no events. If there are events in the list, it then converts each start time to a Date object. It then sorts these dates.\n\nAfter sorting the dates, it compares consecutive dates to check for any overlap. If it finds an overlap (i.e., if the next date is less than or equal to 30 minutes after the previous one), it returns \"Conflict\". If it does not find any overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,353],"elapsed":2.836557436,"_type":"aimessage"}]
