If at any point the start of one event is after the end of another, or the end of one event is before the start of another, then we have a conflict. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it will return \"No conflicts\". \n\nYou can use the function by passing in a Vector{Tuple{Date, Date}} as input:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2021-05-01T14:00\", \"2021-05-01T16:00\"), \n          (\"2021-05-01T13:00\", \"2021-05-01T15:00\")]\nprint(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs: Conflict\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":3.350174757,"_type":"aimessage"}]
