If it is, it returns `\"No events\"`. Then it goes through each pair of events by comparing their start and finish times. If any event ends after another one starts or vice versa, the function immediately returns `\"Conflict\"`. If all events are non-overlapping, the function eventually reaches the end of the list without returning \"Conflict\", in which case it returns `\"No conflicts\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,372],"elapsed":2.956416233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
