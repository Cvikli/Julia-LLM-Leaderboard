Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Here is a possible solution:\n\nFirst, you need to install the necessary packages with Pkg.add(). Here's how you would implement the function event_scheduler:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing TimePeriods\nusing DataFrames \n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    df = DataFrame(start=[], finish=[])\n    \n    for event in events\n        start_time = DateTime(event[1])\n        finish_time = DateTime(event[2])\n        \n        push!(df, [start_time, finish_time])\n    end\n\n    conflicts = @dataframes df[] begin\n            TimePeriods.Between(df[:start], df[:finish]) .== 1\n        end\n    \n    if sum(conflicts) > 0\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the event list is empty. If it's not, it transforms each tuple (start_time, finish_time) into a DataFrame row and then checks for any conflicting periods using TimePeriods.Between. This returns a vector where the value at index i is 1 if there is a conflict between the start and end times of event i with those of every other event in the list. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\"; otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":3.095317352,"_type":"aimessage"}]
