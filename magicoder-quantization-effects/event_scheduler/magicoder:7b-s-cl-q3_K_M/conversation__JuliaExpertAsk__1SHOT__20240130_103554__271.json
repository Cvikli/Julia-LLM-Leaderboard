Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple approach using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort the events by start and end time\n    for i in range(len(sorted_events)-1):\n        if not (datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') > datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i+1][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')):  # check for overlapping events\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    if len(events) == 0:  # if no events are given, return appropriate message\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nThis function works by sorting the list of events by their start and end times. It then checks each event in turn to see whether it overlaps with the next one (i.e., if its end time is after the next event's start time). If any overlap is found, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function will return \"No conflicts\" if there were events given and otherwise, will return \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":2.25738361,"_type":"aimessage"}]
