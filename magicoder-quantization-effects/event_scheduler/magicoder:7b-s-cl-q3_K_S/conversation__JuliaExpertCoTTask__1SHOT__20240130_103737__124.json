Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then sorts the events based on their start times. Next, for each pair of consecutive events, it checks if the start time of the second event is earlier than or equal to the end time of the first one. If this condition holds true, it means that there's a conflict between these two events and hence \"Conflict\" will be returned. If not, it continues checking the remaining events in the same way. If no conflicts are found after scanning all pairs of consecutive elements, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":2.753700537,"_type":"aimessage"}]
