Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted = sort!(collect(map(t -> (Date(t[1], \"UTC\"), Date(t[2], \"UTC\")), events)))\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted)\n        if sorted[i][1] <= sorted[i-1][2] || sorted[i][1] == sorted[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function works by first converting all date/time strings to Date type, sorting the events in ascending order of their start times. Then it checks for any overlapping events by comparing each event's start time with the previous one. If there is an overlap, return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, then return \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that if two events overlap in time but have different start and finish times, they should still be considered as a conflict. Also, it assumes that the timestamps provided are either in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' or 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, where the date part is optional if the event only involves one time point. In case of any error like wrong input format, unexpected timestamp types etc., this function may throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":2.762735061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
