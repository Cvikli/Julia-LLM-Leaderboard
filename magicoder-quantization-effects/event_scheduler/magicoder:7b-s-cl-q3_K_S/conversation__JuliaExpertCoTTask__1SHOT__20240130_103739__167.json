Then it creates an array of DateRange objects for each event using the `for` loop and the `DateRange` function from Dates package. The array is sorted by its starting times to make sure there are no conflicts in the order. It uses another `for` loop to check if any two events overlap, returns \"Conflict\" immediately when it finds a conflict. If the entire list of events passes this check without finding any overlap, it finally concludes that there's no conflict and returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":2.398601845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
