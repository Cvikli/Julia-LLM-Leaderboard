Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python script that uses the `Dates` library to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime as dt\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef event_scheduler(event_list):\n    if len(event_list) == 0: return \"No events\"\n    \n    # convert start and finish times into datetime format\n    event_df = pd.DataFrame([e[::-1] for e in event_list], columns=[\"finish\", \"start\"])\n    event_df['start'] = pd.to_datetime(event_df['start'])\n    event_df['finish'] = pd.to_datetime(event_df['finish'])\n    \n    # check if any start time is before the previous event's finish time\n    conflicts = (event_df['start'].shift(-1) > event_df['finish']).any()\n\n    return \"No conflicts\" if not conflicts else \"Conflict\"\n```\n\nIn this function, we first convert the start and finish times into datetime format. Then we check if any of the events have a start time that is after the previous event's finish time (which would indicate a conflict), using `shift(-1)` to look at the next row in the DataFrame. If there are conflicts, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input list of events is sorted by start times. Also, please make sure pandas and dateutil libraries are installed on your machine.\n\nYou can run this code using the following python command:\n```python\nprint(event_scheduler([('2021-12-31 23:59', '2022-01-01 00:00'), ('2022-01-01 00:00', '2022-01-01 00:30')]))\n```\nThis will print \"Conflict\" because the first event starts after the second one finishes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,456],"elapsed":3.730207721,"_type":"aimessage"}]
