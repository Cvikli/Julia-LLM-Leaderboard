It checks for overlapping events by comparing the start and finish times for every two events in the list. If any pair of events overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If no events overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it simply returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.262253203,"_type":"aimessage"}]
