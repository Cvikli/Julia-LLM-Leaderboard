Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible Julia solution for the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x -> DateTime(x[1]))\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        prev_event = DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][1]):Minute(1):DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2])\n        current_event = DateTime(sorted_events[i][1]):Minute(1):DateTime(sorted_events[i][2])\n        \n        if intersect(prev_event, current_event) != []\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we first sort the events by their start time. Then we iterate over each event and check for any overlap with the previous event. If there is an overlap, we return \"Conflict\". If no conflict was found after checking all pairs of events, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nTesting the function:\n```julia\n@time event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis should return \"Conflict\" since the second event is within the first one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,370],"elapsed":3.010008497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
