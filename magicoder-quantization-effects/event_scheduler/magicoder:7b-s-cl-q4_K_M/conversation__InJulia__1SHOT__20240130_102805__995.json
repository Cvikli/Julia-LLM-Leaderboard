[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If an overlap is detected, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it adds the start and finish times of the current event into a dictionary `schedule`, using them as keys and marking whether they are start or end times respectively. \n\nIf all events pass this check without finding any conflicts, then it returns \"No conflicts\", indicating that there is no overlapping schedules.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":2.726936175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
