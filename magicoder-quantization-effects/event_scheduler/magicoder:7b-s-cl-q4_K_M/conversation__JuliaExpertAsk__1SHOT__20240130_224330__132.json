Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using the `datetime` module:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    # Check if there are no events\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    for i in range(len(events)):\n        start1, finish1 = map(lambda x: datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), events[i])\n        \n        for j in range(i+1, len(events)):\n            start2, finish2 = map(lambda x: datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), events[j])\n            \n            # Check if there is an overlap between the two events\n            if (start1 <= finish2) and (start2 <= finish1):\n                return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nThis function works by iterating over all pairs of events, checking for any overlap. If it finds a pair with an overlap, it immediately returns 'Conflict'. If it goes through all the pairs without finding an overlap, it finally returns 'No conflicts'. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the events are sorted in ascending order by their start times. If they're not, you should sort them before passing to this function.","status":200,"tokens":[153,300],"elapsed":2.364288106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
