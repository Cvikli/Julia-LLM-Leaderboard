Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the built-in sorted function to sort the events by their start time:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime \n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    # Sort events by start time\n    events.sort()\n    \n    # Check for overlapping events\n    for i in range(len(events) - 1):\n        current_event = events[i]\n        next_event = events[i+1]\n        \n        if current_event[1] > next_event[0]:  # If the finish time of one event is greater than the start time of the other, there's an overlap\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThis code uses a simple approach to detect overlapping events: it checks if the end time of one event is later than the start time of another. If that's the case, then there's an overlap and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no such overlap is found after going through all the events in sorted order, it means there are no overlapping events and so the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIn terms of error handling, we could add more specific checks or exceptions to handle cases where the input format doesn't match the expected one (for instance, if the start time is greater than the finish time) or when an event isn't a tuple with exactly two elements. However, for simplicity this function does not include such features.","status":200,"tokens":[0,338],"elapsed":2.730679663,"_type":"aimessage"}]
