X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Then we sort the events by their starting times. The function will check for conflicts by checking if the start time of an event is before the finish time of the previous event (or the first event, as there are no previous ones). \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime},1})\n    # Handle empty list case\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n  \n    # Convert strings to DateTime objects and sort the events by their starting times\n    events = map(e -> (DateTime(e[1]), DateTime(e[2])), events);\n    sort!(events, lt = (a, b) -> a[1] < b[1])\n  \n    # Check for overlapping events\n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        if events[i][1] <= events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n  \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function can be tested with the following input:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2021-10-01 09:00\", \"2021-10-01 10:00\"), (\"2021-10-01 08:00\", \"2021-10-01 12:00\"), \n          (\"2021-10-01 10:30\", \"2021-10-01 11:00\")]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":3.410046753,"_type":"aimessage"}]
