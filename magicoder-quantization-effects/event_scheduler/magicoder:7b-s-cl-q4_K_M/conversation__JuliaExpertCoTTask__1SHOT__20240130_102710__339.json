Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem using the built in sorting and comparison functions of Julia. Here is a simple solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    # sort events by start time\n    sorted = sort(events, lt = (a, b) -> a[1] < b[1])\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted)\n        if DateTime(sorted[i][1]) <= DateTime(sorted[i-1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn the function, we first check whether the events list is empty. If it is, we immediately return \"No events\". Otherwise, we sort the events by their start time. Then, for each event (except for the first one), we check if its start time is earlier than or equal to the end time of the previous event. If so, there is a conflict and we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,258],"elapsed":2.107420687,"_type":"aimessage"}]
