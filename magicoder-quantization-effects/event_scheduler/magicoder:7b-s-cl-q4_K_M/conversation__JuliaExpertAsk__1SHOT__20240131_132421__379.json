Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python script that uses the `Dates` library to solve your problem:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    \n    for i in range(len(sorted_events) - 1):\n        start_time = datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n        end_time = datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n        \n        next_start_time = datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i+1][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n        \n        if start_time < next_start_time:\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nThis function works by first sorting the events based on their starting times. Then, it iterates through each event and checks if its end time is before or at the same time as the start of the next event. If any such pairing is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no such pairings are found after checking all possible pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can call this function with a list of events like so:\n```python\nevents = [('2021-01-01 10:00', '2021-01-01 11:00'), ('2021-01-01 11:30', '2021-01-01 12:00')]\nprint(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs: Conflict\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,420],"elapsed":3.375467216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
