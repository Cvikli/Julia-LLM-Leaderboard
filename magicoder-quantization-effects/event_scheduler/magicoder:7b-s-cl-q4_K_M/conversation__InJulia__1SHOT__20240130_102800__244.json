Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

We'll sort the events by their start times and then iterate over them to see if there are any conflicts.\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    # If no events are provided return \"No events\"\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parse the start and finish times of each event to DateTime objects\n    parsed_events = [(parse_time(s), parse_time(f)) for (s, f) in events]\n    \n    # Sort the events by their start time\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=first)\n\n    # Iterate over the sorted list and check if there are any conflicts\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        current_event = sorted_events[i]\n        next_event = sorted_events[i+1]\n        \n        # If a conflict is found, return \"Conflict\" immediately and break the loop\n        if !(current_event[2] < next_event[1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If no conflicts are found, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check if the provided list of events is empty. If it's not, we parse each event's start and finish times into DateTime objects. We then sort these parsed events by their start time. After sorting, we iterate over the sorted list to compare the end time of one event with the start time of the next. If any end time is later than or equal to the start time of the next event, it means there's a scheduling conflict and hence we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[123,493],"elapsed":4.014944678,"_type":"aimessage"}]
