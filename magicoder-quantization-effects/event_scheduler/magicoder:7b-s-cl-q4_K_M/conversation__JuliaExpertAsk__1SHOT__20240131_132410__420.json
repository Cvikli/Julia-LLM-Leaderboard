If so, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the events by their start time. Afterwards, it iterates through each event and compares its start time to the previous event's finish time. If a conflict is found (i.e., an event starts before the previous one has finished), it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,303],"elapsed":2.422670356,"_type":"aimessage"}]
