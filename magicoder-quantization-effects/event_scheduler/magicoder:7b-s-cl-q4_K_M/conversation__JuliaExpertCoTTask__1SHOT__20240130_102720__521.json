It uses the DateTime type to easily handle date-time comparisons. If it finds any conflict, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflict is found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":3.202886689,"_type":"aimessage"}]
