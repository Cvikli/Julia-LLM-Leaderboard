[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it finds a conflict, it returns 'Conflict'. \n\nPlease note that this function does not handle the case where an event finishes at midnight (00:00) on the same day as another event starts. This would be considered a conflict according to common understanding of scheduling conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":3.013358226,"_type":"aimessage"}]
