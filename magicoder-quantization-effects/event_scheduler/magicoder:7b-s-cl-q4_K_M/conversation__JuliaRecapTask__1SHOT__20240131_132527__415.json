X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it's not, it then parses each event into a `Date` object and finds all unique dates from all events. Then it initializes an empty tree for each date. After that, it inserts each event into the correct date's tree. Finally, it checks if there are any conflicts in each tree by checking if the tree has more than one element (i.e., more than one event). If there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: This function assumes that events can't overlap on the same day. If they can, you would need to modify this function slightly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,569],"elapsed":4.702529567,"_type":"aimessage"}]
