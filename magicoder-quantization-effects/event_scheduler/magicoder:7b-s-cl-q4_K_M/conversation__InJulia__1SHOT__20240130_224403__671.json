If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the events are sorted by start time. If they're not, you might need to sort them before calling `event_scheduler`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":2.861848967,"_type":"aimessage"}]
