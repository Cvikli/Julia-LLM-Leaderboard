If it's empty, it returns \"No events\". Then it iterates over each event and for every event, it compares its start time with the finish times of all other events and vice versa. If any overlap is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2021-05-30 10:00\", \"2021-05-30 12:00\"), (\"2021-05-30 11:00\", \"2021-05-30 13:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs: Conflict\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":2.946106373,"_type":"aimessage"}]
