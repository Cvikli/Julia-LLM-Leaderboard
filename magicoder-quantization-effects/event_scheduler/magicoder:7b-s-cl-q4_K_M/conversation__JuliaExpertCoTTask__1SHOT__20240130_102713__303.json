Each tuple contains the start and finish times of a single event in string format ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). It then checks for any overlapping events by sorting the events by their start time and comparing each pair of consecutive events. If there are any overlapping events, it returns \"Conflict\", otherwise it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,366],"elapsed":3.008174092,"_type":"aimessage"}]
