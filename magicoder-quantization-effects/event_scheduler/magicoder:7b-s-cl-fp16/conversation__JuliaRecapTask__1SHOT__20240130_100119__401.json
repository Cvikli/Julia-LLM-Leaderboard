X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Here's how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    # Check for empty events array\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse and sort the events by start time\n    parsed_events = map(s -> (DateTime(parse(Date, s[1]), DateFormat(\"yy-m-d HH:M\")), \n                             DateTime(parse(Date, s[2]), DateFormat(\"yy-m-d HH:M\"))), \n                       events)\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=first)\n    \n    # Check for overlap in the sorted list of events\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i-1][2] # If event start time is before previous end time, it's an overlap\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n``` \nThis function first checks if the input list of events is empty. If so, it returns a message indicating that there are no events. Then it parses each tuple in the list into two DateTime objects and sorts them by their start time. After sorting, it iterates through the sorted list comparing each event's start time with its previous end time. If any event's start time is before its preceding event's end time, there's a scheduling conflict, so the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,418],"elapsed":7.393138814,"_type":"aimessage"}]
