Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it's not, it sorts the events by their start time and then iterates over them. For each event, it checks whether its start time is before its finish time (to avoid any possible errors) and whether there's a previous event that has a later end time than the current one. If such an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":5.158363047,"_type":"aimessage"}]
