[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If so, we return `\"No events\"`. \n- Then we create a DataFrame with start and finish times of each event. \n- After that, for every two events (we can optimize it by checking only pairs where `i < j`), we check if there are any time overlaps between the two events. If such overlap exists, we return `\"Conflict\"`. \n- If no conflicts found for all the events in the list, we return `\"No conflicts\"`. \n\nThis function assumes that your input is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a start and finish time. It also assumes that these times are provided in the 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format. If this assumption does not hold true, you will need to modify the parsing logic for DateTime accordingly.\n\nThe `intersect()` function from DataFrames package is used to find overlapping time periods between two events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,546],"elapsed":9.749452387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
