Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution:\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    # Check if there are no events \n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    events = sorted([[datetime.strptime(i, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'), \n                      datetime.strptime(j, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')] for i, j in events])\n  \n    # Loop through the list of events to check if there are any overlapping events\n    for i in range(1, len(events)):\n        # If a conflict is found, return \"Conflict\"\n        if events[i][0] < events[i-1][1]:\n            return \"Conflict\"\n  \n    # If no conflicts are found, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\nYou can use the function as follows:\n\n```python\nprint(event_scheduler([('2023-01-01 08:00', '2023-01-01 09:00'), ('2023-01-01 07:00', '2023-01-01 10:00')]))\n# Outputs: Conflict\n```\n\nThis function works by first sorting the list of events by their start times. Then, it checks for any overlapping events by comparing the start time of each event with the end time of the previous event. If a conflict is found, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function finally returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the list of events only contains valid datetime strings in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. If there's a possibility that the input could be invalid, you should add some error handling code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,438],"elapsed":7.664349485,"_type":"aimessage"}]
