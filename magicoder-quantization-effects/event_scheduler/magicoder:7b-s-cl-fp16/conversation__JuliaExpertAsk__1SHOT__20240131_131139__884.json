We first parse all the date/time strings into `DateTime` objects, then sort them to ensure that we can compare adjacent pairs of events.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    parsed_events = map(event -> (DateTime(event[1], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")), DateTime(event[2], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))), events)\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by=x->x[1])\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i - 1][2] # If current event starts before previous one ends\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it's not, it parses each date/time string into a `DateTime` object and stores them in an array of tuples. It then sorts this array by start time. \n\nIt then iterates over all pairs of adjacent events (i.e., `(events[i], events[i + 1])`), checking if the start time of the current event is before the end time of the previous one. If it is, that means there's a conflict and it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,382],"elapsed":6.625404922,"_type":"aimessage"}]
