It uses the `intersect` function from the Dates package to find any overlapping periods between two time intervals and returns `true` if there is an intersection, indicating a conflict. If no intersections are found across all pairs, it concludes that there's no conflict among the events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":4.730533797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
