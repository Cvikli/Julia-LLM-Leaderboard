Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using Julia language:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataStructures\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    schedule = OrderedDict{DateTime, Vector{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}}}()\n\n    for (start, finish) in events\n        start_time = convert(DateTime, start)\n        finish_time = convert(DateTime, finish)\n        \n        if haskey(schedule, start_time)\n            push!(schedule[start_time], (start_time, finish_time))\n        else\n            schedule[start_time] = [(start_time, finish_time)]\n        end\n    end\n    \n    for values in values(schedule)\n        if length(values) > 1\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks whether the input list of events is empty. If it is, then it returns \"No events\". It then loops through each event and converts its start and finish times into DateTime format. It creates an OrderedDict where keys are the start times of the events and values are vectors of tuples corresponding to different events that overlap with this time slot. Finally, it checks whether any event's start and end times overlap and if there is more than one tuple in a value (i.e., two or more events overlapping), then it returns \"Conflict\" immediately because an event can't overlap with itself. Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":6.337587413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
