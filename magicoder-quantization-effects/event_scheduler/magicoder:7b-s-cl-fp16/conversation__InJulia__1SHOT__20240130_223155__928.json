Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If not, it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the list of events by their start times. After that, it iterates over each event in the sorted list and checks for conflicts with previous events. If a conflict is found, it stops checking and returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it updates the end time of the last checked event and continues to check the rest of the events. If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input list of events is sorted by start times in ascending order. If not, you should sort the list before calling `event_scheduler`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":7.011474755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
