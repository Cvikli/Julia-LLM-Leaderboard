Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it is, it returns \"No events\". If not, it parses each start and end time into a DateTime object using Dates.parse(). It then compares each event's start and end times with every other event's start and end times. If any pair of events overlap in time, the function immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,288],"elapsed":5.012469283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
