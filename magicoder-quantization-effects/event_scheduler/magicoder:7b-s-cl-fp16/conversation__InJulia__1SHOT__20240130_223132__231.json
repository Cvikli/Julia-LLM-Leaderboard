[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it finds an overlap, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,337],"elapsed":5.822405658,"_type":"aimessage"}]
