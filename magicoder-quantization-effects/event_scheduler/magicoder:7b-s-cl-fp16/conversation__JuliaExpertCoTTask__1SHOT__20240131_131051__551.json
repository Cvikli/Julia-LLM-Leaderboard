The function `event_scheduler` takes an array of tuples, each tuple representing an event with start and end times. It first parses these time strings into DateTime objects using `Dates.DateTime`. Then it checks if there are any overlapping events by comparing the start and end times of each pair of events. If there is no overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\". If there is any overlap, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String},1})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x -> (parse(DateTime, x[1]), parse(DateTime, x[2])))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][1]) < DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThe `sort!` function sorts the array of events based on their start times, and then we iterate over this sorted list to check for any overlapping events. Note that we use `DateTime(x[1])` to parse the start time from a tuple, because `parse(DateTime, x[1])` would try to parse the entire string as a single DateTime object, which wouldn't work if the string contains both date and time information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":6.144895955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
