The function `event_scheduler` takes as input a list of tuples where each tuple represents an event with its start and end time, then it checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataStructures\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if there are no events\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Create a sorted list of intervals\n    schedule = SortedSet{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}}()\n    for event in events\n        push!(schedule, (DateTime(event[1]), DateTime(event[2])))\n    end\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    prev_interval = first(schedule)\n    for interval in schedule\n        if !isempty(intersection(prev_interval, interval))\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        prev_interval = interval\n    end\n    \n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function with your data:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\n@show event_scheduler(events)\n```\n\nThis function works by first sorting the list of events into a sorted set, then checking each pair of adjacent events for any overlapping time. If an overlap is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nNote: This function assumes that the input times are valid DateTime values and does not check this. It also assumes that the intervals do not wrap around midnight (24:00 to 00:00).","status":200,"tokens":[0,451],"elapsed":7.885664574,"_type":"aimessage"}]
