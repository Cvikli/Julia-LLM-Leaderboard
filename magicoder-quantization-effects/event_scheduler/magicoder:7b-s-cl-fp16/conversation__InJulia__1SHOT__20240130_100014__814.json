We first convert strings to `Date` type then compare them with each other. If there is an overlap between two events, we return \"Conflict\". If there are no overlapping events in list of events, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nTest the function with some example inputs:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2019-04-15 10:30\", \"2019-04-15 11:00\"), (\"2019-04-16 12:00\", \"2019-04-16 13:00\")]\n@show event_scheduler(events) # \"No conflicts\"\n\nevents = [(\"2019-04-15 10:30\", \"2019-04-15 11:00\"), (\"2019-04-15 10:45\", \"2019-04-15 11:30\")]\n@show event_scheduler(events) # \"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,600],"elapsed":10.544494988,"_type":"aimessage"}]
