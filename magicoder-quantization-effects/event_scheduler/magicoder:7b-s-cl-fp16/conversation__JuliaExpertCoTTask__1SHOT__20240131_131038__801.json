Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Then, you can iterate over the list of events and check for conflicts by comparing each event's finish time with the next event's start time. If any conflict is found, return \"Conflict\".\n\nHere is a sample code snippet:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Convert string times to DateTime objects and sort the events by start time\n    sorted_events = sort([(DateTime(e[1]), DateTime(e[2])) for e in events], by=first)\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the given data:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis code should return \"Conflict\" because the second event starts before the first one finishes.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":6.307222061,"_type":"aimessage"}]
