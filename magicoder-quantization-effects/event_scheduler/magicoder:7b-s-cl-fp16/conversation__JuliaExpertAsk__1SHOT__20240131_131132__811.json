Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can implement `event_scheduler` using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start1 = DateTime(events[i][1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n        finish1 = DateTime(events[i][2], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start2 = DateTime(events[j][1], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n            finish2 = DateTime(events[j][2], dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\n            \n            if !isempty(intersect(start1:Minute(1):finish1, start2:Minute(1):finish2))\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through every pair of events and checks for any overlapping times. If it finds any, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":5.373633153,"_type":"aimessage"}]
