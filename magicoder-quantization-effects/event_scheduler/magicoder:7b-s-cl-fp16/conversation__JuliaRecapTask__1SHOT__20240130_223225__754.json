[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input `events` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: a string representing the start and finish time of an event, and any additional data related to the event. The times are expected to be in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. \n\nAlso, this function does not handle cases where events have different durations or where they overlap partially but do not completely overlap. If you need to handle such cases, you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":6.213187423,"_type":"aimessage"}]
