[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it's empty, it returns 'No events'. Then it sorts the event list in increasing order of start time and iterates through each pair of consecutive events. For each pair of events, it parses the date and times from their strings using `parse` function from Dates package, then checks whether the start time of current event is earlier than finish time of previous one. If so, there's a conflict between these two events, and the function immediately returns 'Conflict'.\n\nIf no conflicts found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, the function finally returns 'No conflicts'.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":3.015762522,"_type":"aimessage"}]
