Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Julia solution using Dates:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if list is not empty and has at least two elements \n    if length(events) < 2\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n  \n    for i in 1:length(events)-1 \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            # Parse the date-time format from string to Date type and time difference.\n            start_event1 = DateTime(split(events[i][1], ' ')[1])\n            end_event1 = DateTime(split(events[i][2], ' ')[1]) \n          \n            start_event2 = DateTime(split(events[j][1], ' ')[1]) \n            end_event2 = DateTime(split(events[j][2], ' ')[1])\n            \n            # Check for overlap between two events.\n            if (start_event2 >= start_event1 && start_event2 <= end_event1) || (end_event1 >= start_event2 && end_event1 <= end_event2) \n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n  \n    # If there are no conflicts between all pairs of events, return \"No conflicts\".\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this function we check for each pair if any event starts or ends during the time that another one is running. We split the string into start and end date-time, parse them to DateTime type and check if they overlap by comparing their start and end times. If there's a conflict found, we return \"Conflict\", otherwise we return \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty or contains only one event, it returns \"No events\" as required. \n\nYou can call this function with your own list of tuples like: `event_scheduler([(\"2023-10-01 08:00\", \"2023-10-01 10:00\"), (\"2023-10-01 09:00\",\"2023-10-01 11:00\")])`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,505],"elapsed":4.457771145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
