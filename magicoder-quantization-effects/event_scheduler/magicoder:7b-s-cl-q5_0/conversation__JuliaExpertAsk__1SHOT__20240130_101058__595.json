Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia solution:\n\nFirstly, we need to parse your date strings into DateTime format which Dates module can handle.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # If there are no events return \"No events\"\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=first)  # Sort the list of events by start time\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        event1 = first(sorted_events[i-1])\n        event2 = first(sorted_events[i])\n        \n        if occursin(\" \", event1) && occursin(\" \", event2) # Check if the string contains space, which is a separator between date and time in your format.\n            dt1 = DateTime(event1, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            dt2 = DateTime(event2, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            \n            # If the start of event 2 is before the end of event 1, there's a conflict.\n            if dt2 <= dt1\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        else\n            println(\"Invalid format for event time.\")\n            return \"Invalid format for event time.\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If we didn't find any conflicts, then there are no conflicts.\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first sorts the list of events by start time. Then it compares each pair of adjacent events to see if they overlap. If any event finishes before the next one starts, then there is a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nYou should call this function with a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an event's start and end times.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2018-12-30 16:00\", \"2018-12-30 17:00\"), (\"2018-12-30 17:00\", \"2018-12-30 19:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Prints \"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,521],"elapsed":4.592008651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
