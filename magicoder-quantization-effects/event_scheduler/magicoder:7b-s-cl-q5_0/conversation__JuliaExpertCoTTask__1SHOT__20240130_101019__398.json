Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve the problem using the Dates package in Julia. Here is an example of a solution:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i = 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start1, finish1 = parse.(DateTime, split(events[i], ' '))\n        start2, finish2 = parse.(DateTime, split(events[i+1], ' '))\n\n        if (start1 <= start2 <= finish1) || (start2 <= start1 <= finish2) \n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each pair of events and checks for any overlap in time. If it finds one, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no conflicts are found after checking all pairs of events, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nIf the list is empty, it immediately returns \"No events\". This way, you check every event pair once and don't need to go through all combinations.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.215052369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
