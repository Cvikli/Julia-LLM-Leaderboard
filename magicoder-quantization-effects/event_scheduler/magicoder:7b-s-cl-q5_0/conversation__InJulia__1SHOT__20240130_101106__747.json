Note that we assume that the input list of tuples (start_time, finish_time) is sorted by start time:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    start_time = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi\")\n    \n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        current_event_start = start_time.format(events[i][1])\n        current_event_finish = start_time.format(events[i][2])\n        \n        previous_event_end = start_time.format(events[i - 1][2])\n        \n        if isbefore(current_event_start, previous_event_end) || isbefore(current_event_finish, previous_event_end)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nIn this function, `events` is a list of tuples (start time, finish time). The function checks each event against the immediately preceding one to see if there's any overlap. If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If it checks all events without finding an overlap, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[123,326],"elapsed":2.861895041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
