Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve the task using Julia language. Here is a solution for this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted = sort(events, by = x -> (x[1], x[2]))\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted)\n        if isoverlapping(sorted[i-1], sorted[i])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n  \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction isoverlapping(event1::Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}, event2::Tuple{DateTime, DateTime})\n    return !(event2[1] > event1[2] || event2[2] < event1[1])\nend\n```\nThis solution first sorts the events based on their start times. Then it checks each pair of consecutive events for overlapping. If it finds any, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nRemember to run `using Dates` at the beginning of your code to use the `DateTime` type from the `Dates` package.","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":2.47564047,"_type":"aimessage"}]
