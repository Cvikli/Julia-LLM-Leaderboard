Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution using Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=first)\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        start1, finish1 = parse.(Date, split.(sorted_events[i-1], 'T')[end-1])\n        start2, finish2 = parse.(Date, split.(sorted_events[i], 'T')[end-1])\n        \n        if !isnothing(intersect(start1:finish1, start2:finish2))\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, we first sort the events list by their start times. Then, for each event (except the first one), we parse its start and finish time and check if there is an intersection between it and the previous event's time range. If there is any overlap, we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, we continue to the next event.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes events are not overlapping at the exact start or end of the day (00:00 - 24:00). Adjustments might need to be made if such cases can occur in your real world scenario.","status":200,"tokens":[0,319],"elapsed":2.741868511,"_type":"aimessage"}]
