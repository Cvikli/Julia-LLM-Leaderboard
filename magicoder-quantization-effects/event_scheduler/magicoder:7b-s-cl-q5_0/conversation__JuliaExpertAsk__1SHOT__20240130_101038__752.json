Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution using the `datetime` module to handle date-time strings:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # Sort by start time and then finish time.\n    \n    for i in range(len(sorted_events) - 1):  # Compare all pairs of events.\n        if datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i][1], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') > datetime.strptime(sorted_events[i + 1][0], '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'):\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThis function works by sorting the events by their start and finish times, then comparing each pair of adjacent events. If there's a conflict (i.e., if an event's finish time is after the next event's start time), it returns \"Conflict\". If it can go through all events without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease note that the function assumes that the input list of events will always be valid and correctly formatted. It also assumes that the given date-time strings are in the correct format and do not have any errors or exceptions. For production code, you may want to add error checking for these cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,329],"elapsed":2.844004878,"_type":"aimessage"}]
