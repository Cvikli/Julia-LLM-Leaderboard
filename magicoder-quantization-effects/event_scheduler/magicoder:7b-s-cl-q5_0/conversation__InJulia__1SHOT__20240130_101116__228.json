[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If any two events overlap in time, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found after going through all possible pairs of events, the function then finally returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the start time for one event is always less than or equal to the finish time for that same event.","status":200,"tokens":[0,335],"elapsed":2.873762128,"_type":"aimessage"}]
