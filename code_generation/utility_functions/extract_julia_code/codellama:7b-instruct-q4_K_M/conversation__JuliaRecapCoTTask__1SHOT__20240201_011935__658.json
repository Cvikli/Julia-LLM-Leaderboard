[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is my solution to the problem:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"^( +)```([^`]+)$\", md)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(map(x -> x[2], code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function `extract_julia_code` takes a single argument `md`, which is a string containing the markdown document.\n* The function uses the regular expression `^( +)` to match all lines that are indented by one or more spaces and start with three backticks (```). This will match each code block in the markdown document.\n* The second capture group `([^`]+)` captures everything up to the next set of backticks, which marks the end of the code block.\n* The function uses the `matchall` function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the string, and then uses the `map` function to apply a transformation to each match. In this case, the transformation is to extract the second capture group (the Julia code) and concatenate it with a newline character (`\\n`).\n* Finally, the function uses the `join` function to join all the extracted Julia code together into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.737181764,"_type":"aimessage"}]
