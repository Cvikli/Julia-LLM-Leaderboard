[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's get started! Here is my solution:\n```scss\nfunction extract_julia_code(md) {\n  const code_blocks = md.split(/(?<!\\\\)```/);\n  const joined_code = code_blocks.join('\\n');\n  return joined_code;\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* First, we split the markdown document `md` on the triple backticks (`\\``) to extract all the code blocks. We use a negative lookbehind assertion `(?<!\\\\)` to ensure that we don't split on escaped triple backticks.\n* Next, we join the code blocks together with a newline character `\\n`.\n* Finally, we return the joined code as a string.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no escaped triple backticks (`\\``) within the code blocks. If there are, they will be treated as part of the code block and not as escape characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":1.832157874,"_type":"aimessage"}]
