Here is an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` to extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n```\ndef extract_julia_code(md: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all Julia code blocks from the given Markdown document.\n\n    Args:\n        md (str): The Markdown document containing the Julia code blocks.\n\n    Yields:\n        str: The extracted Julia code blocks, joined together with a newline.\n    \"\"\"\n    for code_block in md.splitlines():\n        if code_block.startswith(\"``` julia\"):\n            yield strip_code_fences(code_block)\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n* It iterates over each line of the Markdown document using the `splitlines()` method.\n* It checks each line to see if it starts with the string \"``` julia\". If it does, it yields the stripped code block.\n\nTo strip code fences, you can use the `strip_code_fences()` function, which removes the triple backticks and any space characters before or after them. Here's an example of how you could implement this function:\n```\ndef strip_code_fences(code_block: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Strips the code fences from a Julia code block.\n\n    Args:\n        code_block (str): The Julia code block to strip the fences from.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The stripped Julia code block.\n    \"\"\"\n    return code_block.replace(\"```\", \"\").replace(\" \", \"\")\n```\nYou can then call the `extract_julia_code()` function on your Markdown document, like this:\n```\nresult = extract_julia_code(md)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis will print out all of the extracted Julia code blocks, joined together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[72,442],"elapsed":22042.696302292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
