Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in md\n        if line[1:] == \"```\"\n            push!(code_blocks, line[2:end])\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over the lines of the Markdown document `md`, and for each line that starts with a code fence (`````), it adds the rest of the line to a list of code blocks. Finally, it returns a single string containing all the code blocks joined together with a newline at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[118,167],"elapsed":20.156978,"_type":"aimessage"}]
