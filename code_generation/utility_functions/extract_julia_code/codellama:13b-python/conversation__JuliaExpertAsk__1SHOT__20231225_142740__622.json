[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Input Specification\n\nThe input will consist of a markdown document `md` (you may assume that no characters in the document have special meaning in the markdown language). The code blocks are indicated by code fences. A code fence is a line containing three backticks: <code>```</code>. If a code block is preceded by text, then there will be at least one empty line between them (if it isn't preceded or followed by another code block). The input markdown document may also contain other kinds of blocks, such as lists.\n\n# Output Specification\n\nThe output should be the joined together code blocks (if any) with a newline after each code block and no code fences. If there is no code to extract, return an empty String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput: <code>md = \"```julia\\ndef test(x, y)\\n    println(x + y)\\nend```\"</code>\nOutput: <code>\"def test(x, y)\\n    println(x + y)\\nend\\n\"</code>\n**Example 2:**\n\nInput: <code>md = \"```julia\\ndef test()\\n    println(10)\\nend\\n```Hello world!```python\\ntest()\\n```\"</code>\nOutput: <code>\"def test()\\n    println(10)\\nend\\nHello world!\\ndef test()\\n    print(\\\"hello, python\\\")\\nend\"</code>\n**Example 3:**\n\nInput: <code>md = \"\"```julia\nprintln(\"no code block?\")\n```\"\"\"</code>\nOutput: <code>\"println(\\\"no code block?\\\")\\n\"</code>\n# Note\n\nPlease do not use built-in parsing libraries to extract the blocks. If you think your solution is very complicated, try to implement it yourself with a recursive function (or by using stacks) so that we may see how you handle parsing on your own. We recommend [this website](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) as a guide for the markdown syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[72,504],"elapsed":27.432990792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
