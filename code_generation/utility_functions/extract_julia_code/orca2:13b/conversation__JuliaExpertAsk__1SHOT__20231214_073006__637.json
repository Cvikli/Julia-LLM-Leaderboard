Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Understood! Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = findall(md, Markdown.CodeBlock)\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `findall` function is used to find all the code blocks in the input Markdown document using the `Markdown.CodeBlock` regular expression.\n* The `join` function is used to join the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`) at the end of each block.\n* The resulting string is returned as the output of the `extract_julia_code` function.","status":200,"tokens":[118,182],"elapsed":6.613383833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
