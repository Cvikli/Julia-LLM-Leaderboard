To extract the julia code blocks from a markdown document, you can use the following function:  ```julia function extract_julia_code(md) # split the document into lines lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # initialize an empty string for the output output = \"\" # loop through each line in the document for line in lines # check if the line starts with a code fence marker if startswith(line, \"```\") # skip the line if it does not mark_as_code!(line) else # join the line with a space if occursin(\" \", line) # add a space after each word otherwise output = output * line * \" \" end if occursin(\"\\n\", line) # check if the line ends with a code fence marker if startswith(line, \"```\") # append the line to the output if not output *= line end # remove the trailing newline if occursin(\"\\n\", output) output = strip(output) return output end extract_julia_code end ```  To use this function, you can pass a markdown document as an argument, for example:  ```julia julia> extract_julia_code(\"```julia struct S <: A {x} end ```\\nThis is some text.\")``` The output of the function will be:  ```python 'struct S <: A {x} end' ``` ```  I hope this helps you with your task.
