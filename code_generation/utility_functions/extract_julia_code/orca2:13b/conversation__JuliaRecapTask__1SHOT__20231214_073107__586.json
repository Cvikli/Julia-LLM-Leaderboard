X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Based on the information provided, here are the steps I will follow to extract the Julia code blocks from the Markdown document:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets: Before starting the task, I will quickly review the Julia language syntax and standard libraries to recall any useful snippets that may come in handy during the extraction process.\n2. Solve the Task: Using the recalled snippets and the information provided about the Julia language, I will start reading the Markdown document line by line and extracting all the code blocks. I will use regular expressions to identify and capture the code blocks, which will be defined using triple backticks (`````) or fenced code blocks (```.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct: Once I have extracted all the code blocks, I will double-check that they are correctly formatted and do not contain any unwanted characters or formatting issues.\n4. Return the extracted code: Finally, I will join all the extracted code blocks together with a newline and return them as a string.\n\nHere's an example of how the function `extract_julia_code` might look like:\n```scss\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Recall useful Julia snippets\n    recall_useful_snppets = \"\"\"\n        # Using triple backticks for code blocks\n        ```\n        # Using fenced code blocks\n        ```\n     \"\"\")\n\n    # Solve the task\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in md\n        if linematch(/^```([^]]+)?$/)\n            push! code_blocks, line[1:end-1]\n        elseif linematch(/^'(.*(?:\\((?1).*)|[^{]})')$/)\n            push! code_blocks, line[1:end-1]\n        else\n            push! code_blocks, line\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Double-check that the solution is correct\n    for i in 1:length(code_blocks)\n        code_block = code_blocks[i]\n        if !isvalidJuliaCode(code_block)\n            error(\"Invalid Julia code block at line $i\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n\nfunction isvalidJuliaCode(code::AbstractString)\n    # Check for invalid syntax\n    if !contains(code, \"=\") && !contains(code, \"/**\")\n        error(\"Invalid Julia code: missing equals or `/**` comment\")\n    end\n    return true\nend\n```\nIn this example, the function `isvalidJuliaCode` checks whether the input string is a valid Julia code by checking for the presence of an equal sign (`=`) or a `/**` comment. If either of these elements is missing, the function returns `false`, indicating that the code is invalid.\n\nNote that this is just one possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function, and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[389,700],"elapsed":29.954291667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
