[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, first, we outline a plan, followed by implementing the Julia function according to the plan.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Split the Document**: We will split the provided markdown document by lines.\n2. **Identify Julia Code Blocks**: As we process each line, we'll keep track of when we enter and exit a Julia code block. A Julia code block is typically indicated by triple backticks followed by 'julia'.\n3. **Extract and Clean the Code**: As we identify a code block, we'll extract the lines of code, omitting the starting and ending fences (i.e., ```julia and ```).\n4. **Join Code Blocks**: If there are multiple Julia code blocks, we will join them together with a newline character.\n5. **Return the Concatenated Code**: The result will be returned as a single string containing all extracted Julia code lines, separated by newlines where necessary.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Split the markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize variables\n    is_julia_block = false\n    extracted_code_lines = []\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # Check if we're entering a Julia code block\n        if starts_with(line, \"```julia\")\n            is_julia_block = true\n            continue\n        # Check if we're leaving a Julia code block\n        elseif line == \"```\" && is_julia_block\n            is_julia_block = false\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we're in a Julia code block, append the line to extracted_code_lines\n        if is_julia_block\n            push!(extracted_code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join the extracted code lines with newline characters\n    return join(extracted_code_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function carefully follows the plan laid out, using standard Julia features and programming constructs to identify, extract, clean, and concatenate Julia code from a markdown document containing potentially multiple Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[339,432],"elapsed":37.545043833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
