[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It looks for strings that start with *```julia* and end with *```*, capturing everything in between.\n- It safely extracts all captures (which are the actual code inside the code blocks) from the matches.\n- All the extracted code blocks are then joined together with a newline, satisfying the requirement to return a single string containing all the code blocks.\n- The use of `AbstractString` allows the function to accept any string type, and `String` as a return type specification clearly indicates the nature of the output.\n- This solution follows the systematic approach and adheres to the guidelines provided for using Julia language features and standards.","status":200,"tokens":[338,364],"elapsed":36.209165875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
