Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve the task of extracting Julia language code blocks from a markdown document, we can follow a systematic approach. First, we need to parse the markdown document to identify the code blocks specifically designated for the Julia language, which are typically enclosed within triple backticks (\\`\\`\\`) followed by `julia` to specify the language. Once we identify these blocks, we'll remove the enclosing backticks and join all Julia code blocks with a newline character. Given these specifications, let's proceed step-by-step.\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\n1. **String Manipulation:** To work with the markdown content, we'll use string functions such as `split`, `strip`, to process the text.\n2. **Regular Expressions:** Regular expressions can be particularly helpful for identifying the Julia code blocks within the markdown. Julia's `Regex` function will come in handy.\n3. **Control Structures:** We might need loops or conditionals to iterate through the markdown content and extract the necessary parts.\n4. **String Joining:** The `join` function can be used to concatenate the collected Julia code blocks with a newline.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\nGiven the requirements, here's an approach to implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString) :: AbstractString\n    # Split the markdown document by lines to process it\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize variables to keep track of code blocks and whether we are inside a Julia code block\n    julia_code_blocks = []\n    in_julia_block = false\n    current_block = []\n    \n    # Use a regular expression to match Julia code block starting lines\n    start_block_regex = r\"^```julia\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # Check if line marks the beginning of a Julia code block\n        if occursin(start_block_regex, line)\n            in_julia_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Check if line marks the end of a code block\n        if line == \"```\" && in_julia_block\n            in_julia_block = false\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, join(current_block, \"\\n\"))\n            current_block = []\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we are inside a Julia code block, collect the line\n        if in_julia_block\n            push!(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all Julia code blocks with a newline and return\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check that the solution is correct\n\n1. **Code Block Identification:** The solution identifies Julia code blocks by looking for lines that start with \"```julia\" and ends with three backticks. This approach correctly detects the start and end of Julia code blocks, even when multiple blocks are present.\n   \n2. **Removal of Code Fences:** By only appending lines inside the Julia code block to `current_block`, the function effectively excludes the code fences from the output.\n   \n3. **Joining of Code Blocks:** The final join operation concatenates all identified Julia code blocks with a newline, matching the task requirement.\n\nGiven this implementation, the solution should accurately extract and return all Julia code blocks from a given markdown document as a single string, following the problem statement's specifications.","status":200,"tokens":[339,689],"elapsed":48.919481125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
