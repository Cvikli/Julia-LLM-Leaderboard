[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Takes a markdown document `md` as its argument.\n2. Finds all Julia language code blocks within the markdown document. These are identified by blocks surrounded by triple backticks with `julia` right after the opening backticks.\n3. Extracts the content of these code blocks by removing the code fences (the triple backticks and the `julia` indicator).\n4. Joins all extracted code blocks together, separated by a newline.\n5. Returns the concatenated string containing all the extracted Julia code blocks.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString) :: AbstractString\n    # Regular expression to find code blocks that specify Julia (`julia`)\n    # This regex searches for the pattern: starts with ```julia, captures everything until the closing ```\n    julia_code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\s*[\\s\\S]*?```\"\n\n    # Extract all matching Julia code blocks from the input markdown document\n    matches = matchall(julia_code_block_regex, md)\n\n    # Remove the fences and the `julia` language specifier, then join them\n    extracted_code_blocks = [replace(m.match, r\"^```julia\\s*|\\s*```$\" => \"\") for m in matches]\n\n    # Join all extracted blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join(extracted_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation defines a regex pattern capable of capturing Julia code blocks from the markdown, extracts these blocks while trimming the code fences, and combines all code texts into a single string, separated by newlines where necessary. This approach ensures that all Julia code blocks are concatenated into a single, usable string.","status":200,"tokens":[338,363],"elapsed":36.126497041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
