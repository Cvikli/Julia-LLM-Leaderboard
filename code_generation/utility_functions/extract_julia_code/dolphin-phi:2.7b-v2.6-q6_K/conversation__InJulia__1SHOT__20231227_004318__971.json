Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract and join julia code blocks in a markdown document, we can use the `md` library which is specifically designed to parse and process Markdown documents. The `extract_julia_code` function will do this:\n\n```python\nfrom md import *\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\ndoc = parse(md, 'utf-8')\n\ndef extract_code_block(node):\nif isinstance(node, CodeBlock):\nreturn \"\\n\".join(child.content for child in node.children if child.type != 'fence')\n\nall_codes = [extract_code_block(node) for node in doc.traverse('*')]\n\njoined_codes = \"\".join(all_codes)\n\nreturn joined_codes\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It first parses the Markdown document `md` into a `Document` object using the `parse` method from the `md` library. The parsed document is then returned to the caller.\n2. Inside the function, it defines a nested helper function called `extract_code_block`. This function takes a node in the parsed document and checks if it's a code block by checking its type. If it's a code block, it returns a list of lines from the code block without any code fences. The `join` method is used to concatenate all these lines into a single string with line breaks.\n3. Then, it uses the `traverse` method on the parsed document to iterate through all elements in the document tree (excluding headings). For each element, it calls the `extract_code_block` function to extract its code block and adds the resulting code blocks to a list.\n4. Finally, it concatenates all the extracted code blocks into a single string using the `join` method and returns this string as the result of the `extract_julia_code` function.\n\nNote: Make sure to import the `md` library at the beginning of your script with `from md import *`. You can also use the `doc = parse(md, 'utf-8')` line directly in your code if you don't want to define a separate variable for the parsed document.","status":200,"tokens":[89,494],"elapsed":12.974675291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
