Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Markdown, Extraction\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\nparts = extract(md, '|_*_*_*') %>% map(~remove('#{$}'))\nif isempty(join(parts, '\\n'))\nreturn \"\"\nelse\nreturn join(parts, '\\n')\nend\nend\n```\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function uses the `Extraction` module to extract all the code blocks from the given Markdown document. It then removes any code fences using the `remove` function and joins the extracted code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function. If there are no code blocks, an empty string is returned; otherwise, the joined code blocks are returned as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[126,186],"elapsed":5.016294667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
