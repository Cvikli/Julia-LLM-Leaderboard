If it does, the code block is added to an array `code_blocks`. If it doesn't but there are already code blocks in the array and the current line is empty, the last code block is removed. Finally, the function returns a string containing all the extracted code blocks joined together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":3.028113861,"_type":"aimessage"}]
