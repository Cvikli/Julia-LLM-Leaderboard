Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code = [] # initialize an empty array to store the extracted code blocks\n    for line in split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            code = push!(code, strip(line[4:end-3]))\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code, \"\\n\") # join the extracted code blocks with a newline and return as a String\nend\n```\nExplanation of the implementation:\n\n1. The function takes in an `md` string that contains markdown code blocks.\n2. We split the `md` string into individual lines using `split(strip(md), \"\\n\")` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace and newline characters.\n3. We iterate through each line of the `md` string using a for loop.\n4. If the current line starts with \"```\" and ends with \"```\", we know that it is a code block. We use `startswith(line, \"```\")` to check if the current line starts with \"```\", and `endswith(line, \"```\")` to check if the current line ends with \"```\".\n5. If the current line is a code block, we push its content into an empty array called `code` using `push!(code, strip(line[4:end-3]))`. We use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace characters from the code block content, and `[4:end-3]` to remove the \"```\" characters at the start and end of the line.\n6. After iterating through all lines of the `md` string, we return a String by joining the extracted code blocks with a newline using `join(code, \"\\n\")`. We use `join()` to join each code block in the `code` array with a newline character, and return the result as a String.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that there are no nested code blocks within the markdown document. If you need to handle nested code blocks, you will need to modify the implementation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,481],"elapsed":6.77367683,"_type":"aimessage"}]
