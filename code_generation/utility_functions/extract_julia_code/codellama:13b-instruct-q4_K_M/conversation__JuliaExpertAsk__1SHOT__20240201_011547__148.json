Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = []\n    for block in eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.+?)\\n```\", md)\n        push!(code, strip(block[1]))\n    end\n    return join(code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nNote: The `eachmatch` function returns an iterator over all matches of a pattern in a string. The `(...)` capture the matched group, and the `.+?` is a non-greedy match that will stop at the first `\"`\"`. The `strip` function removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,143],"elapsed":1.982901396,"_type":"aimessage"}]
