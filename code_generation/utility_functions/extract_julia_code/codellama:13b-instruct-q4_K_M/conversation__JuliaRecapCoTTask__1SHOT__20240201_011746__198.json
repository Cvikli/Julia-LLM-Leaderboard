[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'm glad you asked for special instructions! Here's an updated version of the `extract_julia_code` function that takes into account the instructions provided:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::Markdown.MD)\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    code_blocks = Markdown.find_code_blocks(md)\n\n    # Join all code blocks together with a newline\n    julia_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Remove code fences from each code block\n    for i in 1:length(julia_code)\n        if startswith(julia_code[i], \"```julia\")\n            julia_code[i] = replace(julia_code[i], r\"^`{3}julia\", \"\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the joined and cleaned up Julia code as a String\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\nThis function first finds all code blocks in the markdown document using `Markdown.find_code_blocks`. It then joins all code blocks together with a newline, and removes code fences from each block using a regular expression. Finally, it returns the joined and cleaned up Julia code as a String.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are separated by a newline character. If your markdown document contains multiple code blocks that are not separated by newlines, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,343],"elapsed":4.765702299,"_type":"aimessage"}]
