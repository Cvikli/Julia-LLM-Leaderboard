Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can define such a function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::Markdown.MD) :: String\n    codeblocks = Markdown.CodeBlock[]\n    for block in md.content\n        if block isa Markdown.CodeBlock && block.language == \"julia\"\n            push!(codeblocks, block)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(map(x -> x.code, codeblocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown.MD` type to represent a markdown document and the `Markdown.CodeBlock` type to represent a code block in that document. It then iterates through each content element in the document and checks if it is a `CodeBlock`, and if it's language is \"julia\". If both conditions are met, the `CodeBlock` is appended to the `codeblocks` array. Finally, the code blocks are joined together with newlines using `join(map(x -> x.code, codeblocks), \"\\n\")` and returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,252],"elapsed":3.479746997,"_type":"aimessage"}]
