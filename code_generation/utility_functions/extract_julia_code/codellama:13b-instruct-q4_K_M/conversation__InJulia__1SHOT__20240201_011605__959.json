If the current line is a Julia code fence, it skips it and moves on to the next line. If the current line is not a Julia code fence, it adds it to the extracted code string using `*=`. Finally, it returns the extracted code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[89,257],"elapsed":3.476142462,"_type":"aimessage"}]
