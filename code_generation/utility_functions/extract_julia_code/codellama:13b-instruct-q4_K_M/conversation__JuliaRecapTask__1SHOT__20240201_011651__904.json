[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how to implement `extract_julia_code` based on the provided task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::Markdown)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for element in md.elements\n        if isa(element, CodeBlock)\n            # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line\n            lines = split(strip(element.code), \"\\n\")\n            push!(code_blocks, join(lines, \"\\n\"))\n        end\n    end\n    return strip(\"\\n\".join(code_blocks))\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over the elements of `md`, checks if each element is a code block (using the `isa` function), and if it is, adds its contents to an array called `code_blocks`. The function then joins all the code blocks together with newline characters (`\\n`) using the `join` function. Finally, it returns the resulting string after stripping off any leading or trailing whitespace.","status":200,"tokens":[0,224],"elapsed":3.056830757,"_type":"aimessage"}]
