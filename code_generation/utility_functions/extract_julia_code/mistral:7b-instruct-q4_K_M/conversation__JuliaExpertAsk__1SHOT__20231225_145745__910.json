Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    for line in split(md, \"\\r\\n\")\n        if match(line, r\"\\`\\s*(.*?)\\`\")\n            code .= join([trimspace(match(line, r\"\\`\\s*(.*?)\\`\")[1])], \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function takes a markdown string as input and returns the extracted Julia code blocks joined together with a newline. The function uses regular expressions to match the code fences (`\\` delimiters) and extracts the content within them. It then trims any leading/trailing whitespace and joins the extracted blocks with a newline before returning the result.","status":200,"tokens":[129,179],"elapsed":7.639088042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
