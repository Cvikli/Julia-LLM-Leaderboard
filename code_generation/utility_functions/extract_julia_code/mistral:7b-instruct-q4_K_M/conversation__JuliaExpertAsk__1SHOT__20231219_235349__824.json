Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here's the function you requested:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the Markdown document\n    doc = JLMDocument(md)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    codes = []\n    for node in doc.root.children\n        if node.type === \"code\"\n            push!(codes, node.content)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences\n    codes = [clean_code(c) for c in codes]\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* `JLMDocument(md)` parses the Markdown document into a tree structure using the `JLMDocument` type from the `Markdown` package.\n* We then iterate through the children of the root node in the tree, checking each node's type to find all the code blocks.\n* Once we have found all the code blocks, we use the `clean_code()` function (which is not included here) to remove any code fences from the code blocks.\n* Finally, we join all the cleaned-up code blocks together with a newline using the `join()` function.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the Markdown document contains only Julia language code blocks, and that there may be multiple code blocks in the document. If your Markdown document contains other types of content (e.g., prose), you'll need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[118,351],"elapsed":12.230381042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
