[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The function takes a markdown document `md` as input and returns a string containing the extracted Julia code.\n```\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    doc = parse(md)\n    for c in children(doc)\n        if typeof(c, Block) && !isempty(c.content) && c.content[1] == \"```\"\n            code_block = c.content[2:end-1]\n            extracted_code_block = strip(replace(replace(replace(replace(replace(replace(extracted_code_block, \"\\n\", \"\"), \"\\\\\\\\\\\\`\", \"`\"), \"\\\\\\\\`\\\\`\", \"`\")), \"^\\\\`\", \"\"), \"\\\\`$\"))\n            return extracted_code_block * \"\\n\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"\"\nend\n```\nThe function first parses the input markdown document using the `parse` function from the Markdown package. It then iterates through each child node of the parsed document using the `children` function and checks if the child node is a block using the `typeof` function. If the child node is a block and its content starts with three backticks, the code block is extracted by slicing the content from the second line to the end-2 line and removing leading/trailing backticks and newlines using the `strip`, `replace`, and string interpolation operators. The extracted code block is then returned as a string.\n\nNote that the function assumes that each code block is enclosed in triple backticks (```). If different delimiters are used, you will need to modify the regular expressions used in the `replace` functions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[394,414],"elapsed":18.627595667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
