[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is an example of how I would write a function `extract_julia_code` to achieve that:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = findall(doc, :code)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    extracted_code =join(map(x -> x.value, code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\nThis function first parses the markdown document using the `Markdown` package. It then uses the `findall` function to extract all the code blocks from the document. Next, it removes the code fences (i.e., the triple backticks) from each code block using the `value` property of the `code_block` object. Finally, it joins the extracted code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this function assumes that all code blocks are marked up with triple backticks (`````) and that there are no other types of markdown markup within the document. If your markdown documents use a different syntax for code blocks, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[135,299],"elapsed":10.674061708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
