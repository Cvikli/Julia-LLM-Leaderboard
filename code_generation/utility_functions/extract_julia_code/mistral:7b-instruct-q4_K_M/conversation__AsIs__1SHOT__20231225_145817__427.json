It extracts all the code blocks using regular expression matching and finds the start of each block (`r\"^```.*\\n\"`) and the end of each block (`r\"\\n$\"`). The function then removes the code fences from each block using `replace(code_block, r\"^```\", \"\", 1)`. Finally, it joins all the cleaned code blocks together with a newline character `\\n` and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[85,220],"elapsed":8.8727225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
