The function first splits the markdown document into individual lines, then iterates through each line to extract the code block(s) using regular expressions. If the line starts with triple backticks (```), it means that a new code block is starting, and the function extracts all the code between the backticks. If the line starts with two backticks (```r), it means that the code block is a raw string (which starts with backtick ` and ends with backtick ``) and the function skips it. The extracted code blocks are joined together with newline characters using the `join` function, and returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[223,374],"elapsed":21.158910375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
