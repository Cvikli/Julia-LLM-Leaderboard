[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions for matching code blocks\n   - String manipulation functions for joining and removing substrings\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expression pattern for matching code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```(.+?)\\n(.+?)\\n```\"\n\n    # Use regular expression to find all matches in the markdown string\n    matches = match(pattern, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code blocks\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate through each match and extract the code block\n    for match in matches\n        code_block = match.captures[2]\n\n        # Remove the leading and trailing triple backticks and newlines\n        code_block = replace(code_block, r\"^```|```$\", \"\")\n        code_block = replace(code_block, r\"\\n+\", \"\\n\")\n\n        # Join the extracted code block with the existing extracted code\n        extracted_code *= code_block\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a string\n    extracted_code\nend\n```\n\n3.
