X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions to match code blocks\n   - String manipulation functions to remove code fences and join code blocks\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    pattern = r\"^```julia\\s*(.*?)\\s*```\"\n\n    # Use regular expressions to find all matches in the markdown string\n    matches = match(pattern, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store extracted code blocks\n    code_blocks = Vector{AbstractString}()\n\n    # Iterate through matches and extract code blocks\n    for match in matches\n        code_block = String(match.match)\n\n        # Remove code fences and join multiple code blocks together\n        code_block = replace(code_block, r\"^```\\s+|```\\s+$\", \"\")\n        code_block = replace(code_block, r\"\\n+\\s*\", \"\\n\")\n\n        # Push the extracted code block into the vector\n        push!(code_blocks, code_block)\n    end\n\n    # Join all extracted code blocks with a newline character\n    extracted_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function should correctly extract all Julia code blocks from the given markdown string, remove code fences, and join multiple code blocks together with a newline character. It should return a single string containing all extracted code blocks.\n\nSince there are no examples or test cases provided, it's not possible to verify the correctness of the function without testing it on some sample input. However, the function logic should be correct based on the problem statement and special instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[394,474],"elapsed":4.422735375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
