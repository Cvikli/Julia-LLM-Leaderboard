[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets for processing markdown files and string manipulation:\n   - Reading markdown files: `read` (from Base), `MD` (from IJulia).\n   - String manipulation: `rstrip` (from Base).\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.FileOperations, MD\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n  doc = MD.parse(IOBuffer(md))\n  code_blocks = Vector{String}()\n\n  for node in doc.content\n    if isa(node, MD.Code)\n      push!(code_blocks, node.value.code)\n    end\n  end\n\n  result = \"\"\n  for code in code_blocks\n    code = strip(code, '`')\n    result *= code * \"\\n\"\n  end\n\n  return result\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function extracts all the code blocks from a markdown document, removes code fences, and joins the code blocks together with a newline. It uses the Base.FileOperations and MD packages to parse the markdown document. The code snippet above should be correct according to the problem statement and special instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[396,322],"elapsed":3.015989667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
