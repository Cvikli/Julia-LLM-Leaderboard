[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Regular expressions for parsing markdown files.\n   - String manipulation functions for joining strings.\n   - Functions for extracting code blocks and removing code fences.\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expression for extracting code blocks\n    code_regex = r\"```(.+?)([^\\n]*)```\"\n\n    # Extract all code blocks using regular expression\n    matches = eachmatch(code_regex, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Process each code block match\n    for match in matches\n        # Remove the code fence and newline at the beginning and end of the match\n        code = String(match.match)\n        code = replace(code, r\"^```(.+?)\\n(.+)$\", r\"\\1\\2\")\n\n        # Join multiple code blocks together with a newline\n        if !isempty(extracted_code)\n            extracted_code *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n\n        # Append the extracted code to the output string\n        extracted_code *= code\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a string\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function should correctly extract all the code blocks in a given markdown string, remove the code fences and newlines, and join the code blocks together with a newline. The function uses regular expressions and string manipulation functions to accomplish this task efficiently and in a clear way, adhering to the Julia language guidelines provided.","status":200,"tokens":[394,441],"elapsed":7.094428208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
