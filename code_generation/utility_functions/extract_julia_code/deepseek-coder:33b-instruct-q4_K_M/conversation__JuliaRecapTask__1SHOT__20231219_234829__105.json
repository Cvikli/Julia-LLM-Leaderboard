[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! I'm ready to help you with your task. Based on the information provided, here is my approach to solving the problem:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `String` type for manipulating strings\n\t* `Regex` module for working with regular expressions\n\t* `Base.parse` function for parsing strings\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Read the markdown document `md` and extract all code blocks using `match` to find lines that start with a backtick (``)\n\t* Remove any code fences (lines starting with `#`)\n\t* Join the extracted code blocks together with a newline using `join`\n\t* Return the resulting string\n3. Double-check the solution:\n\t* Verify that the extracted code blocks are correctly joined together\n\t* Make sure there are no extra newlines or other unwanted characters in the result\n\nHere is some sample code to illustrate my approach:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Extract code blocks\n    code_blocks = match(r\"```\", md).split(\"```\")\n    \n    # Remove code fences\n    code_blocks = [c |> c != \"#\"]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nI'll be happy to help if you have any questions or need further clarification on my approach.","status":200,"tokens":[1,338],"elapsed":11.980210166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
