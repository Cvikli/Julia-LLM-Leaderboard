X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

I'm glad you provided the Julia language reference and guidelines for solving problems. Here's my approach to solving the task at hand:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `code_block()` function from the `Markdown` package to extract code blocks from Markdown text.\n\t* `strip_fences()` function from the `Markdown` package to remove code fences.\n\t* `join()` function to join multiple code blocks together with a newline.\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Use `code_block()` to extract all the code blocks from the input Markdown document.\n\t* Use `strip_fences()` to remove any remaining code fences from the extracted code blocks.\n\t* Join the code blocks together with a newline using the `join()` function.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the resulting string contains only the extracted Julia code blocks, without any extra formatting or markup.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract code blocks from Markdown text\n    code_blocks = CodeBlock[]\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if line[:2] == \"```\"\n            push!(code_blocks, CodeBlock(line[3:end], nothing))\n        elseif line[:2] == \"--------\"\n            # Ignore empty lines between code blocks\n        else\n            push!(code_blocks, CodeBlock(line, nothing))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join code blocks together\n    joined_code = []\n    for code_block in code_blocks\n        pushed_code = strip_fences(code_block)\n        push!(joined_code, pushed_code)\n    end\n    return concat(joined_code, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first extracts all the code blocks from the input Markdown document using `code_block()`. It then removes any remaining code fences using `strip_fences()`, and joins the extracted code blocks together with a newline using `join()`. Finally, it returns the resulting string containing only the extracted Julia code blocks.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this implementation!","status":200,"tokens":[389,538],"elapsed":23.310002375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
