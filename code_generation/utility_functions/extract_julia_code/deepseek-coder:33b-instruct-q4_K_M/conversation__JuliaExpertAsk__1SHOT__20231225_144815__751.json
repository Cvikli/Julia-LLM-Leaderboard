Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that uses Julia's `Markdown` package to parse the markdown document and extract the code blocks:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    md = Markdown.parse(md)\n    codeblocks = []\n    for element in md.content\n        if isa(element, Markdown.Code) && startswith(element.language, \"julia\")\n            pushfirst(codeblocks, string(join(split(string(element), \"\\n\")[2:end-1], \"\\n\")))\n        end\n    end\n    return join(reverse(codeblocks), \"\\n\\n\")  # join code blocks with a newline\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown string and iterates over its elements. If an element is a `Markdown.Code` instance that starts with \"julia\", it extracts the actual code block by splitting the string representation of the code block into lines, discards the backticks at the start and end of each line (i.e., code fences), and joins these lines together with newlines to form a single Julia code string. The extracted code blocks are collected in an array `codeblocks` which is then joined into a final string with newline characters between them.","status":200,"tokens":[131,291],"elapsed":49.8838315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
