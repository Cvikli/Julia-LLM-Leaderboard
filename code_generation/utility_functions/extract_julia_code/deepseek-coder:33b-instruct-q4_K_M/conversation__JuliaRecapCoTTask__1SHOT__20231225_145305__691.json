[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The provided task is about parsing a markdown document that contains Julia language code blocks and extracting the code inside them. This can be accomplished by using regular expressions (regex) in combination with the split function to identify and separate the Julia code from other parts of the document.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Split the markdown into a list of code segments \n    blocks = split(md, r\"```julia\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted Julia code\n    julia_blocks = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each segment and check if it's a Julia block \n    for block in blocks\n        # If this is a Julia block, remove backticks and append to the string\n        if endswith(block, \"```\")\n            julia_blocks *= rstrip(split(lstrip(rstrip(block)), \"```\")[2]) * \"\\n\"\n        end \n    end \n    \n    # Return the extracted Julia code blocks as a string \n    return julia_blocks\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the markdown document on each ```julia` code fence, which is then further processed to remove backticks and append the resulting code segments to an output string. The result is a string that contains all of the extracted Julia code from the markdown document. \n\nPlease note that this function only considers Julia blocks delimited by ```julia``` fences, other languages are not considered. If you wish to extend it for other languages, simply replace `\"```julia\"` with the relevant language name in the split function.","status":200,"tokens":[419,385],"elapsed":74.003553167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
