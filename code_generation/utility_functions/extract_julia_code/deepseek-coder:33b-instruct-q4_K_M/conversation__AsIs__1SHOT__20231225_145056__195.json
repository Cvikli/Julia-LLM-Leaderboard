It splits the input string by newline characters to create an array of lines in the markdown document.\n2. Then it filters out all lines that start with `\"```julia\"` which are code blocks.\n3. Next, it splits each line into a list of substrings separated by newline characters and strips them from leading/trailing whitespace.\n4. It also removes the backticks around code lines as they should not be included in the final output. \n5. Finally, it joins all these cleaned up code lines together with newlines to produce a single string of julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[87,264],"elapsed":43.980357417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
