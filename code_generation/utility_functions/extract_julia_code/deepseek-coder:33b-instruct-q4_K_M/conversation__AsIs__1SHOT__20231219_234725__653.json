Here's an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` to extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n```\ndef extract_julia_code(md: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all Julia code blocks from a Markdown document and returns them as a single string.\n\n    Code fences are removed, and the code blocks are joined together with a newline.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use a regular expression to find all code blocks in the Markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'`([^{`])*`', md)\n\n    # Remove any leading or trailing code fences\n    code_blocks = [c for c in code_blocks if c != '```']\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\n\n    return joined_code\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a Markdown document `md` as input, and uses regular expressions to find all code blocks in the document. The regular expression `r'`([^{`])*`' finds any sequence of non-whitespace characters that are enclosed in backticks (``).\n2. The function then removes any leading or trailing code fences from the found code blocks, leaving only the interior code blocks. This is done using a list comprehension: `[c for c in code_blocks if c != '```']`.\n3. Finally, the function joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline character `\\n`, using the `join()` method.\n\nYou can test the function by passing it a Markdown document that contains Julia code blocks, like this:\n```\n# This is a comment\n\n```\njulia code block 1\n```\nThe function should return the following output:\n```\njulia code block 1\n\njulia code block 2\n```\nNote that the function assumes that each code block is on its own line, and that there are no leading or trailing whitespace characters in the Markdown document. If your Markdown document contains code blocks that are not on their own lines, or if there are leading or trailing whitespace characters, you may need to modify the regular expression or the list comprehension to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[72,518],"elapsed":17.631324792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
