Then it removes any empty strings that may be produced as a result of this operation. \n\nThe next step involves taking each non-empty chunk and splitting it again, this time around newline characters (`\\n`). It then takes only the elements in the resulting array corresponding to the Julia code, removing all newline characters from them with `replace(split(x, \"\\n\")[2:end-1], \"\\n\" => \"\")`.\n\nFinally, it joins together all these codes into a single string with `join(codes, \"\\n\")`, ensuring each code block is separated by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[90,257],"elapsed":43.381962584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
