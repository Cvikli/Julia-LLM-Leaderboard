[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code = String[]\n    in_fence = false\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            in_fence = !in_fence\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_fence \n            pushfirst(code, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(reverse(code), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input string `md` into lines and iterating over them. It checks if a line starts with \"```\" and ends with \"```\", signifying the start or end of a code fence respectively. If it does, it inverts the flag `in_fence`.\n\nIf `in_fence` is true (which means we are inside a code block), it pushes the stripped line into the array `code`, which stores all lines of code. Finally, the function returns a string that joins all code lines with newlines. The order is reversed because we accumulated them in reverse order.\n\nPlease note this solution assumes that Julia language code blocks are always fenced by \"```\". If it's not the case, you may need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[419,329],"elapsed":65.611650041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
