Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` to extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n```\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Remove code fences\n    md = re.sub(r'`+`, ''', md)\n    \n    # Split the Markdown into lines of code\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in md.split('\\n'):\n        if line.startswith('```'):\n            code_block = line[len('```'):]\n            code_blocks.append(code_block)\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return '\\n'.join(code_blocks) + '\\n'\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* The first step is to remove code fences from the Markdown document using regular expressions. Code fences are the `â€™` characters that surround Julia code blocks in Markdown. Removing these fences allows us to treat each line of Markdown as a single code block.\n* Next, we split the Markdown into lines of code using the `split()` method. We use the `\\n` character as the delimiter, since each line of Markdown is likely to be a separate code block.\n* We then create a list of Julia code blocks by iterating over the lines of Markdown and appending each line that starts with ``` to our list.\n* Finally, we join the code blocks together using the `join()` method, adding a newline character at the end.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks in the Markdown document. If you need to handle nested code blocks, you can modify the function accordingly (e.g., by recursively applying the function to each code block).","status":200,"tokens":[1,401],"elapsed":12.984047459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
