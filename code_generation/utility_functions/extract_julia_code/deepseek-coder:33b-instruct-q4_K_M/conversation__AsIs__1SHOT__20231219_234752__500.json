Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` to extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n```\ndef extract_julia_code(md: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all the Julia code blocks in the given Markdown document.\n\n    Args:\n        md (str): The Markdown document containing the Julia code blocks.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The extracted Julia code blocks, joined together with a newline.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use re to find all code fences in the document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'``([\\s\\S]*)''`, md)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the remaining code blocks together\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks[:-1]) + \"\\n\" + code_blocks[-1]\n\n    return joined_code\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* The function takes a Markdown document `md` as input.\n* It uses the `re` module to find all code fences in the document using the regular expression `'\"``([\\s\\S]*)''`. This will match any string that is enclosed in backticks (``) and contains any number of whitespace characters (including newlines) inside the fence.\n* It then removes the code fences from the document by selecting the second-to-last element of the list of matches using slicing (`code_blocks[:-1]`). This will leave you with a list of just the code blocks.\n* Finally, it joins the code blocks together with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`), and adds the last code block to the end of the joined list.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is only one code block per document. If there are multiple code blocks, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,429],"elapsed":13.943368541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
