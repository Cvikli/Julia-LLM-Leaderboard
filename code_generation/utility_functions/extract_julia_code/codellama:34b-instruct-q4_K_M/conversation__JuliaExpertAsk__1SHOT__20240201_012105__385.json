Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            push!(code_blocks, replace(line, r\"^[`]{3}\" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\nHere's a brief explanation of the code:\n\n* The function takes a string `md` as input and returns a string.\n* It first splits the input string into lines using the newline character (`\\n`).\n* Then it iterates over each line, checks if it starts with three backticks (`) and ends with three backticks. If so, it removes the code fences using `replace` function and pushes the remaining part of the line to a list called `code_blocks`.\n* Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`) using `join` function.\n* The resulting string is returned as output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,274],"elapsed":7.698010639,"_type":"aimessage"}]
