Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md, :dotall)\n    codes = map(b -> b.captures[1], blocks)\n    return join(codes, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` method to find all code fences in the markdown document. It then extracts the code inside each fence using a regular expression and joins them together with a newline character. Finally, it returns the joined string as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,153],"elapsed":4.292226413,"_type":"aimessage"}]
