It specifically looks for patterns that start and end with ```julia, capturing the content in between. The captured content (i.e., Julia code) from each code block is then concatenated, separated by newlines, into a single string which is returned by the function. Note that the returned string does not include the code fences.","status":200,"tokens":[81,275],"elapsed":22.412968625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
