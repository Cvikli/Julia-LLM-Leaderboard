[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

This function will:\n\n1. Parse the markdown document to identify the Julia code blocks.\n2. Remove the code fences (`` ```julia ```) from the identified code blocks.\n3. Join code blocks together (if there are multiple) with a newline character.\n4. Return the resulting string.\n\nWe will use the following points as a guide to achieve the solution:\n- Code blocks in markdown are typically surrounded by triple backticks (`` ``` ``).\n- Specifically, Julia code blocks start with `` ```julia ```.\n- We don't need to process the content of the code blocks, just extract them.\n- Since this is a text processing task, we will rely on string manipulation techniques.\n\nLet's implement `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold the extracted Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = []\n\n    # Split the markdown document into lines for processing\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize a flag to determine if we're inside a Julia code block\n    in_julia_block = false\n\n    # Initialize a temporary variable to store a code block\n    current_block = []\n\n    # Iterate through each line of the markdown document\n    for line in lines\n        # If the line indicates the start of a Julia code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_julia_block = true\n            continue  # Skip the code fence line\n        end\n        \n        # If the line indicates the end of a code block\n        if line == \"```\" && in_julia_block\n            in_julia_block = false\n            # Add the current block to the list and reset it\n            push!(julia_code_blocks, join(current_block, \"\\n\"))\n            current_block = []\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # If we're inside a Julia code block, add the line to current_block\n        if in_julia_block\n            push!(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join the collected Julia code blocks with a newline and return\n    return join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function will scan through each line of the provided markdown document, detect Julia code blocks, extract their content while excluding the code fences, and concatenate them together with newlines. This solution effectively handles multiple code blocks within a single document.","status":200,"tokens":[338,525],"elapsed":58.994365833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
