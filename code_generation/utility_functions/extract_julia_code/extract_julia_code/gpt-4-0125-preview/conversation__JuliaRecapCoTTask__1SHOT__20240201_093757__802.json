[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To approach this task, we need to create a function `extract_julia_code` that takes markdown content and extracts Julia language code blocks from it. Markdown code blocks are typically delineated by triple backticks ``` followed by an optional language specification. For Julia code blocks, this specifier will be `julia`.\n\nOur approach will include:\n\n1. Identifying code blocks that are specifically marked as Julia code blocks. This requires parsing the markdown document for lines that start with \"```julia\", capturing the content until the closing \"```\".\n2. Extracting the content of these Julia blocks, ignoring the fences.\n3. Joining multiple Julia code blocks together, separated by a newline.\n\nHere's how we can approach the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Split the markdown document into lines for easier processing\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty array to hold lines of Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_lines = []\n    \n    # Flag to track whether we're inside a Julia code block\n    in_julia_block = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is the start of a Julia code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_julia_block = true\n            continue  # Skip the code fence itself\n        end\n        \n        # Check if the line marks the end of a code block\n        if line == \"```\" && in_julia_block\n            in_julia_block = false\n            continue  # Skip the closing fence and stop capturing\n        end\n        \n        # If we are inside a Julia code block, capture the line\n        if in_julia_block\n            push!(julia_code_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join the extracted lines of Julia code with newlines and return\n    join(julia_code_lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function:\n\n- Starts by initializing an array to hold lines of Julia code.\n- Uses a flag to keep track of whether it's currently parsing lines within a Julia code block.\n- Iterates through each line of the markdown document, using logic to determine whether it's entering, inside, or exiting a Julia code block.\n- Adds lines within Julia code blocks to the initialized array, skipping the code block fences.\n- Joins and returns the extracted Julia code lines separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[339,497],"elapsed":55.00304725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
