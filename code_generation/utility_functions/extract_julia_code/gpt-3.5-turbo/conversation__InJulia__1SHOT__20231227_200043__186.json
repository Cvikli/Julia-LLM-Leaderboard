You can use the following code to define the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the code blocks\n    code_blocks = \"\"\n\n    # Extract code blocks from the markdown document\n    code_fences = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(?:.*\\n)?([\\s\\S]*?)```\", md))\n    for fence in code_fences\n        # Remove code fence from code block\n        code_block = replace(fence.match, fence.match => fence.captures[1])\n        # Join code blocks with a newline\n        code_blocks = string(code_blocks, code_block, \"\\n\")\n    end\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function takes a markdown document (`md`) as an input and returns a string containing the extracted Julia code blocks without the code fences, joined together with a newline.\n\nNote that this function makes use of the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to iterate over all the code fences in the markdown document. The `replace` function is used to remove the code fences from each code block, and `string` is used to join all the extracted code blocks with a newline character (`\\n`).","status":200,"tokens":[81,269],"elapsed":5.033515084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
