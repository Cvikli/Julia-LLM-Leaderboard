[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The steps for the solution are as follows:\n\n1. Import the `Regex` module from `Base`.\n2. Define a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document `md` as input.\n3. Use the regular expression `r\"```julia\\s+(.*?)\\s+```\"` to match and extract the code blocks from the markdown document. This pattern captures the code block contents using the `.*?` non-greedy match expression.\n4. Join the extracted code blocks together using `join` and a newline character (`\\n`).\n5. Return the joined code blocks as a string.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\s+(.*?)\\s+```\", md)\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nLet's now test the function with some examples.","status":200,"tokens":[338,228],"elapsed":4.352153542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
