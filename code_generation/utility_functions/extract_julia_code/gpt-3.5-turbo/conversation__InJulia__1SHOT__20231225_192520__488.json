Below is an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    \n    for code_block in split(md, \"```julia\")\n        if contains(code_block, \"```\")\n            push!(code_blocks, replace(code_block, \"```\" => \"\"))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nWith this function, you can pass your markdown document as a string to the `extract_julia_code` function, and it will extract, remove code fences, and join all the code blocks together with a newline. The function returns a string containing the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[81,147],"elapsed":2.507850375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
