[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Use the `matchall` function with the regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` to extract all the code blocks from the markdown document. The `.*?` pattern matches any character (except a newline) lazily, meaning it will match as few characters as possible.\n2. Join the extracted code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function.\n3. Return the resulting string.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nLet's double-check the solution by testing it with some example inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[338,199],"elapsed":4.457068125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
