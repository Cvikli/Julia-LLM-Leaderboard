Here is the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Import the regular expression module.\n2. Define a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document `md` as input.\n3. Use the `matchall` function to find all the julia code blocks in the `md` using the regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"`. The `.` inside the parentheses matches any character except a newline and the `*?` quantifier matches the preceding expression 0 or more times (non-greedy).\n4. Join all the matched code blocks together with a newline character.\n5.
