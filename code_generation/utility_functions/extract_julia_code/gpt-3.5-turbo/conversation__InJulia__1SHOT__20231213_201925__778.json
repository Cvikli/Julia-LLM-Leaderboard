Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Here's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```\")\n    code = \"\"\n    \n    for i in 2:2:length(code_blocks)\n        code_block = strip(code_blocks[i])\n        code = code * code_block * \"\\n\"\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you just need to pass in the markdown document `md` as a string. It will extract the code blocks, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline delimiter. The resulting code will be returned as a string.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!","status":200,"tokens":[81,159],"elapsed":3.529344167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
