[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The regular expression matches any text enclosed within triple backticks with the word \"julia\" followed by a newline character on each end. The `matchall` function returns all the matches found in the markdown document `md`.\n\n2. `replace.(code_blocks, r\"```julia\\n\" => \"\")`: This line uses the `replace` function along with the dot syntax to apply the replacement to each code block. It removes the code fence \"```julia\\n\" from each code block.\n\n3. `strip.(...)`: This line applies the `strip` function to each modified code block to remove leading and trailing whitespace.\n\n4. `join(..., \"\\n\")`: This line joins all the modified code blocks together using the newline character as the delimiter.\n\nNow, we can double-check our solution by running some test cases.","status":200,"tokens":[338,353],"elapsed":6.930566709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
