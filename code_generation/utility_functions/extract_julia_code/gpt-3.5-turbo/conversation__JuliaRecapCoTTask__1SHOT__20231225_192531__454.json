X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here's the step-by-step approach we can take:\n\n1. Use the `replace` function from the standard library to remove the code fences from the markdown document. We can use a regular expression to match the code fences and replace them with an empty string.\n\n2. Use the `matchall` function from the standard library to find all the code blocks in the modified markdown document. We can use a regular expression to match the code blocks and return an array of matches.\n\n3. Join the code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function from the standard library.\n\n4.
