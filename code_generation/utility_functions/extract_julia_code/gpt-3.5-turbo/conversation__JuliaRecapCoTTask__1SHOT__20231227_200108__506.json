[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract the code blocks from a markdown document, we can use the `Markdown` package in Julia. Specifically, we can use the `MD\"...\"` string macro provided by the package to parse the markdown document and extract the code blocks.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = String[]\n    document = MD(md)\n    \n    for block in document\n        if block isa Code\n            push!(code_blocks, block.value)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n- We start by declaring an empty array `code_blocks` to store the extracted code blocks.\n- We then create a `MD` object by providing the `md` string to the `MD` constructor. This object represents the parsed markdown document.\n- Next, we iterate over each element (block) in the parsed document.\n- If the block is an instance of the `Code` type, we extract its value (code snippet) and push it to the `code_blocks` array.\n- Finally, we join the elements in `code_blocks` with newline characters (`\\n`) and return the resulting string.\n\nNote that we're using the `AbstractString` type annotation for the `md` argument to allow for flexibility in the input type. This means that the function can accept both regular Julia strings and other string-like types (e.g., `Markdown.MD` objects).\n\nLet's double-check the solution by running some test cases.","status":200,"tokens":[339,330],"elapsed":6.275798,"_type":"aimessage"}]
