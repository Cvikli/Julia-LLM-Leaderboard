Here's an implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown document `md` as input and uses a regular expression to match all code blocks that start with \"```julia\" and end with \"```\". It then extracts the code within each code block and joins them together with a newline separator. The resulting code is returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[81,131],"elapsed":2.715196083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
