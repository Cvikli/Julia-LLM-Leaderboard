Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to search for Julia code blocks in the markdown string. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` matches any substring that starts with three backticks followed by the word \"julia\", followed by any number of characters (including newlines) up to the next three backticks. The `.*?` in the regular expression is a non-greedy match, which means it matches as few characters as possible before the next three backticks.\n\nThe `eachmatch()` function returns an iterator over all matches of the regular expression in the input string. For each match, the `captures` property returns a tuple containing all captured groups. Since we only have one captured group (the code block), we extract it using `match.captures[1]`.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline using the `join()` function and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[126,293],"elapsed":14.01711625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
