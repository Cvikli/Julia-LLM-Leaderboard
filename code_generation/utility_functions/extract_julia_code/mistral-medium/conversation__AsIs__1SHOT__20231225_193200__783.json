It then iterates over the matches, extracts the code block without the fences using the `captures` property of the match object, and appends it to a string, followed by a newline. Finally, it returns the extracted and joined code.\n\nNote that the regular expression pattern used in this function assumes that the Julia code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks (`````) and have the label `julia`. If the code blocks in your markdown document have a different syntax, you will need to adjust the pattern accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[84,370],"elapsed":8.258008042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
