The regular expression pattern `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"` matches any text that is enclosed between triple backticks (`````) followed by the word `julia`, and ends with another set of triple backticks. The `(.*?)` captures the code block itself.\n\nThe function then extracts the code from each match using the `captures` property of the match object, and joins them together with newlines using the `join` function. The resulting string contains all the Julia code blocks in the markdown document, with each block separated by two newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[87,296],"elapsed":12.956798375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
