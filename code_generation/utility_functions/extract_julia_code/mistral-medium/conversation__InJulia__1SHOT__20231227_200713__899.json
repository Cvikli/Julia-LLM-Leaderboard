It then iterates over the found code blocks and appends their contents to the `extracted_code` string, separating them with a newline. Finally, it returns the extracted code without any leading or trailing newlines.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input `md` string is a valid markdown document and contains at least one code block that starts with ```julia and ends with ```. If this is not the case, the behavior of the function is undefined.","status":200,"tokens":[87,349],"elapsed":8.212652,"_type":"aimessage"}]
