[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The pattern matches triple backticks followed by the word \"julia\", the code block itself, and the closing triple backticks. The `eachmatch` function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the markdown document. For each match, the second capture group (i.e., the code block itself) is extracted and concatenated to the `code` string with a newline character. Finally, the extracted code is returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[87,311],"elapsed":9.972409292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
