Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution using regular expressions to extract the Julia code blocks:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match triple-backticked code blocks with Julia language\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    # Find all matches and extract the code block contents\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)]\n    # Join code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first defines a regular expression pattern to match triple-backticked Julia code blocks, and then uses the `eachmatch` function to find all such matches in the input markdown document. It extracts the code block contents using the `captures` property of each match object, and then joins the code blocks together with a newline using the `join` function. The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[126,227],"elapsed":9.488596125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
