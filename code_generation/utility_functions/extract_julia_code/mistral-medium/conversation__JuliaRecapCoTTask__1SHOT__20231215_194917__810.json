[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the task of extracting Julia code blocks from a markdown document:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match triple-backticked code blocks that contain Julia code\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"is\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each match and join it together with newlines\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to define a regular expression pattern that matches triple-backticked code blocks containing Julia code. The pattern is defined as a raw string literal (`r\"...\"`), which allows us to use backslashes without escaping them. The pattern uses the `s` flag to enable dot-all mode, which allows the dot character to match newlines as well.\n\nThe function then uses the `eachmatch` function to iterate over all matches of the pattern in the input markdown string. For each match, the function extracts the first capture group (which contains the code block itself) and stores it in a vector of strings.\n\nFinally, the function uses the `join` function to concatenate all the code blocks together with newlines in between, and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown string is well-formed and contains valid Julia code blocks. If the input string is not well-formed or contains code blocks in other languages, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[389,372],"elapsed":14.254571291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
