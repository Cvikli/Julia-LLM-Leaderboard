It then extracts the code from each block using the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, and joins them together with a newline using the `join` function.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use this function:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# My Document\n\nThis is a document with some Julia code blocks.\n\n```julia\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = x + y\n```\n\nThis is some more text.\n\n```julia\nfunction hello(name)\n    println(\"Hello, \", name)\nend\n\nhello(\"World\")\n```\n\"\"\"\n\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(code)\n```\nThis would output the following code:\n```\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = x + y\n\nfunction hello(name)\n    println(\"Hello, \", name)\nend\n\nhello(\"World\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[84,376],"elapsed":15.914009209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
