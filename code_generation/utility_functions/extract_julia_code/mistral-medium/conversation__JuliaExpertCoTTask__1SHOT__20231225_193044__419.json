Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the task:\n\n1. Think through your approach step by step:\n\t* Use a regular expression to match code blocks that start with `````julia and end with `````\n\t* Remove the leading and trailing code fences from the matched string\n\t* If there are multiple code blocks, join them together with a newline character\n\t* Return the resulting string\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Define regular expression to match code blocks\n    rx = r\"(?s)```julia(.*?)```\"\n    \n    # Use regular expression to find all matches\n    matches = eachmatch(rx, md)\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over the matches and extract the code\n    for match in matches\n        code = match.captures[1]\n        extracted_code *= strip(code) * \"\\n\"\n    end\n    \n    # Return the extracted code\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n3. Solve the task:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Hello World in Julia\n\nThis is a simple example of a Hello World program in Julia.\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello World\")\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\nOutput:\n```\nprintln(\"Hello World\")\n```\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with different markdown documents that contain varying numbers of code blocks.\n\t* Verify that the extracted code is correct and does not contain any code fences or other markdown formatting.\n\t* Check that the function handles edge cases, such as empty code blocks or code blocks with no code.","status":200,"tokens":[219,433],"elapsed":23.735806167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
