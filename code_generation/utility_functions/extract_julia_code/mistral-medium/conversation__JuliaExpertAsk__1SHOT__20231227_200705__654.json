Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all Julia code blocks using a regular expression\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each block and join them together with a newline\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document, and extracts the code from each block using the `eachmatch` function. It then joins the extracted code together with a newline using the `join` function, and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the code blocks are formatted using triple backticks with the word `julia` before the opening fence, as in the following example:\n```\n```julia\n# This is a Julia code block\nx = 1 + 2\nprintln(x)\n```\n```\nIf the code blocks are formatted differently, the regular expression used in the `extract_julia_code` function may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[126,296],"elapsed":6.64975725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
