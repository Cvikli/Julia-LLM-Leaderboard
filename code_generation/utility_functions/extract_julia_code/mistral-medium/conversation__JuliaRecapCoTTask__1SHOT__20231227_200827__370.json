[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution to extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document using regular expressions:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression to match Julia code blocks between triple backticks\n    r = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"is\n    \n    # Find all matches and extract the code\n    matches = eachmatch(r, md)\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a string `md` containing the markdown document and uses the `Regex` package to match all Julia code blocks between triple backticks. The regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"is` is used to match the code blocks, where `.*?` is a non-greedy capture of any characters between the opening and closing fences. The `eachmatch()` function is then used to iterate over all matches and extract the code blocks. Finally, the code blocks are joined together with a newline using the `join()` function and returned as a string.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the markdown document only contains Julia code blocks and no other type of code blocks. If the document contains other types of code blocks, the regular expression will need to be modified to exclude them. Additionally, this solution does not handle nested code blocks. If the document contains nested code blocks, a more complex parsing approach will be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[389,356],"elapsed":16.816516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
