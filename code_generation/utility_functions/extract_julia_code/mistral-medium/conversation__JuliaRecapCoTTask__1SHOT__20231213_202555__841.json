[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract all the Julia code blocks from a markdown document, we can use regular expressions to search for the code fences and extract the contents within them. Here's one possible solution:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    codes = String[]\n    for match in matches\n        push!(codes, match.captures[1])\n    end\n    return join(codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThe function `extract_julia_code` takes a single argument `md` which is a string representing the markdown document. The function returns a string containing all the Julia code blocks, with the code fences removed and the blocks joined together with a newline character.\n\nThe regular expression pattern `r\"\"````julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"\"` matches any sequence of characters that starts with three backticks followed by the word \"julia\", followed by a newline character, and ends with a newline character that is preceded by three backticks. The `(.*?)` captures the contents of the code block.\n\nThe function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of the pattern in the markdown document. It then initializes an empty array `codes` to store the extracted code blocks. For each match, it extracts the captured group containing the code block using the `captures` property of the match object. It then appends the code block to the `codes` array.\n\nFinally, the function uses the `join` function to concatenate all the code blocks in the `codes` array, separated by a newline character, and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the Julia code blocks are properly formatted with the correct syntax for code fences. If the document contains code blocks with incorrect syntax, the function may not work as expected.\n\nAlso note that this implementation does not handle nested code blocks. If the document contains Julia code blocks within other code blocks, the function will extract only the outermost blocks. If nested code blocks need to be handled, a more complex solution would be required.","status":200,"tokens":[389,485],"elapsed":20.655295041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
