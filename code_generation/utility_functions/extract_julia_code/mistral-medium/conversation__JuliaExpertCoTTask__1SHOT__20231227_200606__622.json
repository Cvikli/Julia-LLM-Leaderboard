Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks using regex pattern\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate through each code block and remove code fences\n    for block in code_blocks\n        # Extract the code between the fences\n        code = block.match[1]\n\n        # Remove the leading and trailing newlines\n        code = chop(chop(code, head=true))\n\n        # Append the code to the extracted_code string with a newline\n        extracted_code *= code * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a string\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Regex` module to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document using the regex pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"`. It then iterates through each code block, removes the leading and trailing newlines, and appends the code to an empty string with a newline in between each code block. Finally, it returns the extracted code as a string.\n\nTo test the function, you can call it with the example markdown document provided in the task:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# My Julia Code\n\nHere is some example Julia code:\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[219,406],"elapsed":18.433003042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
