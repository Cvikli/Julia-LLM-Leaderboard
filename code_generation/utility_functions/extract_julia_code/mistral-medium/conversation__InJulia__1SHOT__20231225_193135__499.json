[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The pattern matches triple backticks followed by the word \"julia\", followed by any number of lines of code, and ending with triple backticks. The function then uses the `eachmatch()` function to find all matches of this pattern in the markdown document. For each match, it extracts the code block and appends it to a string, with a newline character added between each code block. Finally, the function returns the extracted code as a string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown document is a string. If the input is a file or some other type of object, you may need to convert it to a string before passing it to this function.","status":200,"tokens":[87,351],"elapsed":7.86205125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
