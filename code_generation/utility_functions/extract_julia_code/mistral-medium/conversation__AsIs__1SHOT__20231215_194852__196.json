Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n```\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks using a regular expression\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each block and join it together with newlines\n    code = join([match.captures[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all occurrences of Julia code blocks in the markdown document. It then extracts the code from each block using the `captures` property of the match object, and joins the code together with newlines using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are delimited by triple backticks (`````) and the word `julia`. If your code blocks use a different syntax, you will need to modify the regular expression accordingly.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[84,261],"elapsed":5.773570417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
