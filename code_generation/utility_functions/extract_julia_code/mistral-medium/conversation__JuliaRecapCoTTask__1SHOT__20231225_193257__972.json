[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how I would approach solving this problem:\n\n1. First, recall that Markdown code blocks are delimited by triple backticks (`````) and that Julia code blocks specifically can be indicated by the language name (`julia`) following the opening backticks.\n2. Write a regular expression that matches Julia code blocks in Markdown. The pattern should look for an opening fence (`````) followed by the word `julia` (optionally including whitespace and indentation) and then capture all the lines following until the closing fence (`````).\n3. Use the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to iterate through all matches of the regular expression in the input Markdown document.\n4. For each match, extract the captured code block and remove the opening and closing fences using the `replace` function with a regular expression that matches the fences and replaces them with an empty string.\n5. Join all the extracted code blocks together with a newline character using the `join` function.\n6. Double-check that the function works correctly by testing it with some example Markdown documents containing Julia code blocks.\n\nHere's the resulting Julia function:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Regular expression pattern to match Julia code blocks in Markdown\n    pattern = r\"(`{3}.*?julia\\s*[\\r\\n]+)(.|\\n)*?(`{3})\"im\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through all matches of the pattern in the input Markdown\n    for match in eachmatch(pattern, md)\n        # Extract the captured code block and remove the opening and closing fences\n        block = match.captures[2]\n        cleaned_block = replace(block, r\"(`{3})\" => \"\")\n        \n        # Append the cleaned code block to the result string with a newline\n        code *= cleaned_block * \"\\n\"\n    end\n    \n    # Return the extracted and joined Julia code as a string\n    return code\nend\n```\nNote that the function takes an `AbstractString` input to allow for flexibility in the input type and returns an `AbstractString` output to allow for further processing or manipulation of the extracted code. The function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to iterate through all matches of the regular expression pattern in the input Markdown document. The `replace` function is used to remove the opening and closing fences from each matched code block. Finally, the `join` function is used to concatenate all the extracted code blocks together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[389,605],"elapsed":33.09512175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
