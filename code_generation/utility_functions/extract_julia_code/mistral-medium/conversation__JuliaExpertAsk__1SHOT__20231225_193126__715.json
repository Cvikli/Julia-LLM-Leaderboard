Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n```\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Match code blocks with Julia language fences\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm, md)\n\n    # Extract code blocks and join them together with a newline\n    return join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression `r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"sm` in the input markdown document. The regular expression matches code blocks that are enclosed between triple backticks (`````) and have the string `julia` on the first line. The `.*?` pattern matches any character (except a newline) zero or more times, and the `s` flag at the end of the regular expression enables the dot to match newlines as well.\n\nThe `eachmatch` function returns an iterator that yields a `Match` object for each match found in the input document. The `captures` property of the `Match` object contains a tuple with the captured groups defined in the regular expression. In this case, the first and only captured group is the code block itself, so we extract it using the index `1`.\n\nFinally, the function uses the `join` function to concatenate all the extracted code blocks into a single string, with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`) inserted between each pair of adjacent blocks. The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input markdown document is a string, and it does not handle cases where the code blocks are split across multiple lines or contain nested code fences. If you need to handle more complex cases, you may need to modify the regular expression or use a more powerful parsing library.","status":200,"tokens":[126,439],"elapsed":9.841326083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
