Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Match triple-backticked Julia code blocks\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms, md)\n\n    # Extract the code and join with newlines\n    code_blocks = [match.captures[1] for match in matches]\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Regex` module to find all matches of the regular expression pattern `\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"ms` in the markdown document. The `m` flag makes the dot character match newlines, and the `s` flag makes the dot character match all characters (including newlines). The captured group `()\"(.*?)\"` matches the Julia code between the triple-backticks. The code blocks are extracted using a comprehension and joined together with newline characters using the `join` function. The resulting string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[126,250],"elapsed":16.298654125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
