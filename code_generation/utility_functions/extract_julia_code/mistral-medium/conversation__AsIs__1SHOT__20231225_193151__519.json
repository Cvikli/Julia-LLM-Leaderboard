[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md)\n\n    # Extract the Julia code from the code blocks and join them together with a newline\n    julia_code = join([replace(code_block, r\"\\n$\" => \"\") for code_block in code_blocks], \"\\n\\n\")\n\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document, then extracts the code from the blocks and joins them together with a newline. It assumes that the code blocks are formatted using triple backticks and the `julia` language identifier. The `replace` function is used to remove any trailing newlines from the code blocks before joining them together.\n\nNote that this implementation may not handle all possible edge cases, such as code blocks that span multiple lines or contain nested code blocks. It also assumes that the input markdown document is a single string, rather than a file or other type of input. Depending on the specific use case, additional error handling and input validation may be necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[84,290],"elapsed":6.467306291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
