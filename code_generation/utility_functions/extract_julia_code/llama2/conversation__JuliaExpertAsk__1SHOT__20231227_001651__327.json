[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = findall(md, markdown.CodeBlock)\n    joined_code = join(map(x -> x.value, code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `findall` is a function from the `Markdown` package that finds all occurrences of a given pattern in a string. In this case, we're looking for `markdown.CodeBlock` patterns, which are used to delimit Julia code blocks.\n* `map` is a built-in function that applies a function to each element of a list. In this case, we're applying the `value` function to each `markdown.CodeBlock` object in the list of code blocks. The `value` function returns the content of the code block as a string.\n* `join` is a built-in function that joins a list of strings together with a newline character (`\\n`).\n\nWith this function, you can pass in a Markdown document containing Julia code blocks, and it will return a single string containing all the extracted code blocks, without any code fences or line breaks.","status":200,"tokens":[118,290],"elapsed":10.024660083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
