Here's an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` to extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n```\nimport Markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md: Markdown) -> String:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all the Julia code blocks in the given Markdown document, removes code fences, and joins them together with a newline.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get all the code blocks in the document\n    code_blocks = md.find_all(f\"```{Julia}\"))\n\n    # Remove code fences\n    code_blocks = [code_block.strip() for code_block in code_blocks]\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n```\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```\nmd = Markdown.parse(\"Hello, world! \\n``` julia\\n echo 42\")\nprint(extract_julia_code(md)) # Output: \"Hello, world!\\n42\"\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that the Julia code blocks are surrounded by a ````` fence on each line. If your Markdown document uses a different syntax for marking Julia code blocks, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[72,300],"elapsed":10.108515125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
