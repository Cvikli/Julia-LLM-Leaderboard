[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each line in the markdown document\n    for line in md.split(\"\\n\")\n        # Check if the line contains a Julia code block\n        if line.startswith(\"``` julia\")\n            # Extract the code block and remove the fences\n            code += line[9:].replace(r\"``\", \"\") + \"\\n\"\n        else\n            # Add the line to the output string\n            code += line\n        end\n    end\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function takes a markdown document as input, and returns a single string containing all the extracted Julia code blocks. The `startswith` method is used to check if a line starts with the \"``` julia\" fence, and the `replace` method is used to remove the fences from the code block. The resulting code is then added to the output string using concatenation.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the Julia code blocks are marked with the \"``` julia\" fence on each line. If your markdown document uses a different fence or has multiple code blocks, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[118,303],"elapsed":10.563882666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
