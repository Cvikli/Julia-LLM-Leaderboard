[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use the Markdown.jl library to parse the markdown document\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = findall(doc, Node.CodeBlock)\n\n    # Remove code fences by setting the \"lexemes\" attribute to an empty list\n    for (i, b) in eachindex(code_blocks))\n        b.lexemes = []\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(map(b -> b.value, code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how this function works:\n\n1. The `function` keyword defines the function name and syntax.\n2. The `md::AbstractString` parameter is the markdown document that we want to extract the Julia code from.\n3. We use the `Markdown.parse()` function from the Markdown.jl library to parse the markdown document into an abstract syntax tree (AST).\n4. We then use a for loop to iterate over all the code blocks in the AST, and for each code block, we set the \"lexemes\" attribute to an empty list to remove the code fences.\n5. Finally, we join together all the code blocks with a newline using the `map()` function and the `->` operator to create a single string containing all the Julia code.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks or other types of Markdown syntax inside the code blocks. If you need to handle these cases, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[89,394],"elapsed":13.994673208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
