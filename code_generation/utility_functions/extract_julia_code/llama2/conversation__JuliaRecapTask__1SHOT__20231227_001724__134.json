X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\nI will review the provided markdown document `md` and recall any useful Julia snippets that may be helpful in extracting the code blocks, removing fences, and joining the resulting code together with a newline. These snippets could include things like `match`, `split`, `collect`, `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, and more.\n2. Solve the task:\nUsing the recalled Julia snippets and any other relevant tools at my disposal, I will extract all the code blocks from the `md` document, remove any code fences, and join the resulting code together with a newline. I will prioritize performance, clarity, and abstract types whenever possible, and avoid using new packages unless explicitly requested.\n3. Double-check the solution:\nAfter completing the task, I will double-check my solution to ensure that it is correct and meets your requirements.\n\nPlease provide me with the `md` document, and I will get started on extracting the code blocks and joining them together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[389,250],"elapsed":12.251890625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
