[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, thank you for providing me with the task and the markdown document `md`. Based on your instructions, I will proceed to extract the Julia code blocks, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nTo start, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Recall relevant Julia snippets:\n\t* Code fences (`````)\n\t* Julia syntax (e.g., `x = 10`, `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`)\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Use regular expressions to extract all code blocks in the markdown document\n\t* Remove the code fences from each extracted code block\n\t* Join the code blocks together with a newline using the `concatenate` function\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the resulting string contains only Julia code blocks without code fences or newlines\n\nHere's an example of how I will implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Step 1: Recall relevant Julia snippets\n    code_fences =r\"```\"\n    julia_syntax = \"x = 10\", \"if-elseif-else\", \"isX ? X : Y\", \"for\", \"while\"\n\n    # Step 2: Solve the task\n    extracted_code_blocks = regex(r\"\\`\\*`{3,}\") # Extract all code blocks\n    removed_code_fences = map(x -> x[:-2], extracted_code_blocks) # Remove code fences\n    joined_code_blocks = concatenate(removed_code_fences, \"\\n\") # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n\n    # Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n    expected_result = \"```\\n\" * joined_code_blocks # Expected result\n    if (joined_code_blocks != expected_result)\n        error(\"Invalid output: $(joined_code_blocks)\")\n    end\n    return joined_code_blocks # Return the resulting string\nend\n```\nNow, I will call the `extract_julia_code` function with the markdown document `md` as input, and it will extract all Julia code blocks, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline. Here's an example of how to use the function:\n```julia\n> extract_julia_code(\"md\")\n```\nPlease provide the markdown document `md` for me to execute the `extract_julia_code` function.","status":200,"tokens":[11,616],"elapsed":23.177457833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
