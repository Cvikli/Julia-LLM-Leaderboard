[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Based on the problem statement, I will follow these steps to extract all the Julia code blocks from the markdown document `md`, remove code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nStep 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets (5 minutes)\nI will quickly review the Julia language syntax and keywords to ensure I am familiar with them. This includes variables, control structures, functions, arrays, slicing, tuples, namedtuples, dictionaries, and the like.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task (30 minutes)\nI will read through the markdown document `md` and identify all the code blocks that contain Julia code. I will remove any code fences by replacing them with a space. Then, I will join all the code blocks together with a newline separating them. The resulting string will be the extracted Julia code.\n\nStep 3: Double-check Solution (5 minutes)\nTo ensure the solution is correct, I will carefully review the extracted Julia code to make sure it matches the original markdown document `md`. If any discrepancies are found, I will adjust the solution accordingly.\n\nTotal time estimate: 40 minutes.","status":200,"tokens":[389,270],"elapsed":13.149521875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
