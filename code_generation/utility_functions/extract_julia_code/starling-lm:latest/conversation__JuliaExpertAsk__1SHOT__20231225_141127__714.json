Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets your requirements:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Create a regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown\n    regex = r\"(\\s*``` julia\\n[\\s\\S]*?\\n```)\\s*\"\n    \n    # Find all matches and extract the captured groups\n    matches = match(regex, md) do m\n        push!(m.captures, join(split(m.match, \"\\n\")[2:end-1], \"\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Join all captures with a newline separator if multiple blocks exist\n    return join(matches, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first defines a regular expression to match Julia code blocks in markdown. It then finds all matches and extracts the captured groups (i.e., the actual Julia code within each block) by joining the lines between the code fence delimiters (```) with a newline separator. The extracted code blocks are concatenated together using the `join` function if there are multiple blocks, otherwise only the single block is returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[137,262],"elapsed":8.594766583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
