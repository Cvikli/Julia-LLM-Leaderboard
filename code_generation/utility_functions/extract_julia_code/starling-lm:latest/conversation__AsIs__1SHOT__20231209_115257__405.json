Note that this implementation assumes that each Julia code block is preceded by three backticks (triple grave accents) ` and followed by the language name \"Julia\". The function also handles the case where there are no previous Julia blocks in the document.\n\nTo use this function, simply pass a markdown string as an argument, and it will return the extracted and joined Julia code blocks as a single string.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `extract_julia_code` function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nThis is a regular text in markdown format. Here are some Julia code blocks:\n\n```Julia\nprintln(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\nAnd another one:\n\n```Julia\nx = 5 + 7\nprintln(x)\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, world!\")\nx = 5 + 7\nprintln(x)\n```\n\nThis output corresponds to the two Julia code blocks present in the provided markdown string.","status":200,"tokens":[85,638],"elapsed":20.993408083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
