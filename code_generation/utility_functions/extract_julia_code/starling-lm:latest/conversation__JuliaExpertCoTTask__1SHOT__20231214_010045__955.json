Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, let's get started! Here is the function `extract_julia_code` that meets your requirements:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Step 1: Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in md\n        if line[1] == \"```\"\n            code_blocks += [line[:-2]]\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Step 2: Remove code fences\n    code_blocks = Map(code_blocks, &)\n\n    # Step 3: Join code blocks together with a newline\n    code_blocks = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return code_blocks[1] # Return the joined code blocks as a string\nend\n```\nLet me explain how this function works:\n\nStep 1: We use a loop to iterate over each line of the markdown document `md`. For each line, we check if it starts with the code fence symbol ```\". If it does, we add the line to a list called `code_blocks`.\n\nStep 2: We use the `Map` function to remove the code fences from each code block. This is done by replacing the ````` symbols with empty strings, so that the resulting code blocks are without fences.\n\nStep 3: We join all the code blocks together with a newline character `\\n`. This creates a single string that contains all the Julia code in the markdown document.\n\nThe function returns this joined string as its output.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[211,362],"elapsed":13.91536475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
