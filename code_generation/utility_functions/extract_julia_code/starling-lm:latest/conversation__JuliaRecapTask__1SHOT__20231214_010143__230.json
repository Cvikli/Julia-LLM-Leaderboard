[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

I'm ready to help you extract the Julia code from the markdown document. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\nI will recall relevant Julia syntax and features that may be useful in solving this task, such as control structures, functions, arrays, slicing, tuples, namedtuples, dictionaries, and string interpolation.\n2. Solve the Task:\nI will read the markdown document and extract all the code blocks using regular expressions or other text processing techniques. I will then remove any code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nAfter extracting the code, I will double-check that it is correct by running it in a Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) or using a Julia IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to ensure that it works as expected.\n\nHere's the implemented function `extract_julia_code`:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Recall useful Julia syntax and features\n    recall_useful_julia_snippets()\n\n    # Extract code blocks from markdown document\n    code_blocks = findall(md, \"```\")[]\n\n    # Remove code fences\n    code_blocks = [strip(c) for c in code_blocks]\n\n    # Join code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join([c for c in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nTo use this function, simply call it and pass in the markdown document as a string:\n```julia\n> extract_julia_code(\"Markdown document with Julia code blocks\")\n```\nThis should output the extracted Julia code without any code fences or line breaks.
