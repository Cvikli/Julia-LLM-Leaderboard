It joins all the extracted code blocks together with newlines in between if there are multiple code blocks. The function returns a single string containing the extracted Julia code from the markdown document.\n\nTo use this function, you can pass your markdown document as a string to the `extract_julia_code` function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nThis is a sample **markdown** document with some **Julia** code blocks. Here's an example of a Julia code block:\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\nAnd another one:\n```julia\nx = 5 + 6\nprintln(x)\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will print the extracted Julia code from the provided markdown document, which in this case is:\n```\nprintln(\"Hello, World!\")\nx = 5 + 6\nprintln(x)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[93,435],"elapsed":13.484945375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
