[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Here are a couple of test cases:\n```julia\nmd1 = \"This is an example of a `Julia` code block.\\n```julia\\na = 3\\nb = 4\\n```\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md1)) # Output: \"a = 3\\nb = 4\\n\"\n\nmd2 = \"This is an example of a `Julia` code block.\\n```julia\\na = 3\\nb = 4\\n```\\nAnd here's another one:\\n```julia\\na = 5\\nb = 6\\n```\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md2)) # Output: \"a = 3\\nb = 4\\na = 5\\nb = 6\\n\"\n```\nIn both test cases, the function correctly identifies and joins the Julia code blocks together with a newline as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[402,536],"elapsed":18.769312416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
