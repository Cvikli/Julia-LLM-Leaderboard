[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that accomplishes the task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    result = String[]\n    in_fence = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"``` julia\") && !in_fence\n            push!(result, \"\")\n            in_fence = true\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && in_fence\n            in_fence = false\n        elseif in_fence\n            push!(result, line)\n        end\n    end\n    if !isempty(result)\n        return join(result, \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n```\nHere's a breakdown of the function:\n- Split the input markdown into lines.\n- Initialize an array to store the Julia code blocks.\n- Initialize a flag `in_fence` to track whether we are currently in a Julia code block.\n- Iterate through each line of the markdown. If the line starts with \"``` julia\" and `in_fence` is false, add an empty string to the result array and set `in_fence` to true. This indicates that we have started a new Julia code block. If the line ends with \"```\" and `in_fence` is true, this means that we have finished a Julia code block and should reset `in_fence` to false. While `in_fence` is true, add each line of the code block to the result array.\n- After iterating through all lines, if the result array is not empty, join the contents of the array into a single string with newlines in between each element and return it. Otherwise, return an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[402,409],"elapsed":14.613116333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
