It splits the input markdown into lines, iterates over each line, and checks if the line starts with \"```julia\". If it does and the block has not started yet, the current code block is appended to `julia_blocks` and reset. If the block has already started, the current line is appended to the current code block. After processing all lines, the function joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the resulting string.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nThis is some text followed by a julia code block:\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\nAnd another julia code block after that:\n```julia\nfunction add(x::Int, y::Int)\n    return x + y\nend\n```\n\"\"\"\n\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\nThis function will print:\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, World!\")\nfunction add(x::Int, y::Int)\n    return x + y\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[96,519],"elapsed":16.064344875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
