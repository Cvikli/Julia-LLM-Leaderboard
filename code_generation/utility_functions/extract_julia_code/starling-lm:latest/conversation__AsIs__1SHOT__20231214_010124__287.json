Here is an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences, and joins the code blocks together with a newline:\n```\nimport Markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md: Markdown) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all Julia code blocks from a Markdown document.\n\n    Args:\n        md (Markdown): The Markdown document containing the Julia code blocks.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string containing the extracted Julia code blocks, without code fences and with newlines between them.\n    \"\"\".\n\n    # Extract all code blocks from the Markdown document\n    code_blocks = []\n    for para in md.paras:\n        text = para.text\n        if text.startswith(\"```\") and text.endswith(\"```\":\n            # Remove the code fences\n            code_block = text[len(\"```\") : -len(\"```\")]\n            code_blocks.append(code_block)\n    return \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. The function imports the `Markdown` module, which provides a way to parse Markdown text.\n2. The function defines a variable `md` that holds the Markdown document containing the Julia code blocks.\n3. The function uses a loop to extract all the code blocks from the Markdown document. For each para (paragraph) in the document, it checks if the text starts with \"```\" and ends with \"```\". If it does, it removes the code fences and appends the extracted code block to a list called `code_blocks`.\n4. Once all the code blocks have been extracted, the function uses the `join()` method to concatenate them together with newlines between them.\n5. The function returns the resulting string, which contains the extracted Julia code blocks without code fences and with newlines between them.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[72,469],"elapsed":15.939770083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
