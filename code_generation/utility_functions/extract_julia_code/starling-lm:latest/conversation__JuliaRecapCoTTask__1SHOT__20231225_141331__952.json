Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task: We need to identify the code blocks within the markdown document and extract them, remove code fences (triple backticks) and join the code blocks together with newlines. \n\n2. Solve the Task: Using Julia's built-in package `Markdown`, we can parse the Markdown content and identify the code blocks. Then, we can remove the code fences and join the extracted code blocks with newlines. Here is a sample implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    parsed = parse_document(md)\n    blocks = []\n    for node in parsed.nodes\n        if node isa BlockNode && node.type == \"code_block\"\n            push!(blocks, join(node.inlines[1:end-2].content, \"\\n\"))\n        end\n    end\n    return isempty(blocks) ? \"\" : join(blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct: Test the function with various inputs to make sure it works as expected. Here are some test cases:\n```julia\nmd1 = \"\"\"\nThis is a sample markdown document with `some julia code`.\nAnd here's another line of text.\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\nAnd one more line of text.\n\"\"\"\n@assert extract_julia_code(md1) == \"println(\\\"Hello, world!\\\")\"\n\nmd2 = \"\"\"\nThis is a markdown document with no Julia code. Here's an example:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\"\"\"\n@assert extract_julia_code(md2) == \"\"\n\nmd3 = \"\"\"\nHere are two Julia code blocks in the same markdown document:\n```julia\nx = 10\n```\n```julia\ny = 20\n```\n\"\"\"\n@assert extract_julia_code(md3) == \"x = 10\\n\\ny = 20\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[404,519],"elapsed":18.248778584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
