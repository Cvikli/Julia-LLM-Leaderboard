Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example implementation of a function `extract_julia_code` that meets your requirements:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the Markdown document using the JuliaMarkdown package\n    doc = parse(Markdown, md)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    codes = findall(doc, Node => isa(Node, CodeBlock))\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_codes = join(codes, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_codes\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* `parse(Markdown, md)` parses the given Markdown string using the JuliaMarkdown package. This returns a parse tree representing the Markdown document.\n* `findall(doc, Node => isa(Node, CodeBlock))` finds all nodes in the parse tree that are instances of the `CodeBlock` type.\n* `join(codes, \"\\n\")` joins the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`) between each block.\n* The function returns the joined code blocks as a string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the Markdown document contains only Julia code blocks. If the document contains other types of nodes (e.g., headings, bold text, etc.), you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[118,312],"elapsed":10.95056125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
