[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets for handling strings and regular expressions:\n```julia\nusing Regex\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n  # implementation below\nend\n```\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n  regex = r\"^```(\\S+)\\s*(.*?)\\n(```\\1|\\Z)\"\n  matches = matchall(regex, md) do m\n    code_block = String(m.second)\n    code_blocks = split(code_block, \"\\n`+\")\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n  end\n  return join(matches, \"\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nThe function above takes a markdown string as its argument and uses regular expressions to find all code blocks and extract their contents, then joins them together with newlines. This should match the problem statement requirements. Additionally, this implementation should not have any syntax errors or logical issues.","status":200,"tokens":[395,277],"elapsed":10.60549625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
