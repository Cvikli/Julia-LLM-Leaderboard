[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the given task and special instructions, here is how I would approach this problem using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions for extracting code blocks\n   - String manipulation functions like `rstrip` and `join`\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    regex = r\"(```\\s+julia)?(\\[.*\\])?([\\s\\S]+?)(```)\"\n    matches = match.(Regex(\"$regex\"), md)\n    code_blocks = [m.match for m in matches]\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n    \n    for block in code_blocks\n        code = replace(block[2], r\"\\n+\" => \"\\n\") # Replace multiple newlines with a single one\n        extracted_code *= code * \"\\n\" # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    end\n\n    extracted_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function takes a markdown string as its argument, extracts all the Julia code blocks using regular expressions, removes the code fences and any leading captions, joins them together with a newline, and finally returns a single string containing all the extracted code. This should cover the requirements of the task without relying on external packages or introducing unnecessary complexity.","status":200,"tokens":[395,333],"elapsed":12.434010666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
