X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- Regular expressions (`r\"...\"`) to match code fences.\n- String manipulation functions like `split`, `join`, and concatenation (`*` or `+`) to process the extracted code blocks.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expression pattern for matching code fences\n    code_fence_pattern = r\"^```[a-zA-Z0-9]+\\s*\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # Split the markdown string into lines\n    output = String[] # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted code blocks\n    \n    for line in lines\n        match = match(code_fence_pattern, line) # Match the code fence pattern\n        if isnothing(match) # If line doesn't have a code fence\n            push!(output, line) # Add the line as is to the output list\n        else\n            code_block = line + \"\\n\" # Start with the current line and add a newline for the next one\n            \n            while !isempty(lines) && !startswith(lines[1], \"```\") # Keep extracting lines until the next code fence is found\n                push!(code_block, popfirst!(lines))\n            end\n            \n            push!(output, code_block) # Add the extracted code block to the output list\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks together with a newline character and return as a string\n    join(output, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function takes a markdown string as an argument and returns a string containing all extracted Julia code blocks with newlines in between. It uses regular expressions to match code fences and extracts the lines until it encounters the next code fence or reaches the end of the input string. The extracted code blocks are then joined together using the `join` function and returned as a single string.\n\nYou can test this function with various markdown strings containing Julia code blocks to ensure it is working correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[393,533],"elapsed":19.030509375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
