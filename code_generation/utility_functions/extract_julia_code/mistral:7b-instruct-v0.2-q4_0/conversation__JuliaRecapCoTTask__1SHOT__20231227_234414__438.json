X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets for parsing markdown files and handling strings: `readfile`, `rstrip`, `replace`, `split`, and regular expressions.\n2. Solve the Task:\n   a. Read the markdown file using the `readfile` function from the `IOStdout` module.\n   b. Use regular expressions to find all code blocks in the document by searching for strings that start with three backticks (```) and end with the same number of backticks.\n   c. Remove the code fences (i.e., the triple backticks) using string replacement with the `replace` function.\n   d. Join the extracted Julia code blocks together with a newline character, if there are multiple code blocks for a single markdown cell.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   a. Test the function on sample markdown files containing code blocks to ensure it correctly extracts and processes all the code blocks.\n   b. Analyze the performance of the function, ensuring it can handle large markdown files efficiently.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing IOStdout, Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n  # Read markdown file\n  filecontent = readfile(IOBuffer(md))\n  markdown = String(take!(eachline(filecontent), -1))\n\n  # Extract code blocks using regular expressions\n  pattern = r\"(```)(.+?)(\\n?|$)\"\n  matches = matchall(pattern, markdown)\n  julia_codeblocks = [c[2] for c in matches if startswith(first(split(c[1], \" \")[end]), \"julia\" | \"Julia\")]\n\n  # Join code blocks together and remove leading/trailing whitespaces\n  extracted_code = join(map(x -> rstrip(x, '\\n'), julia_codeblocks), \"\\n\")\n\n  return extracted_code\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[395,474],"elapsed":17.063491833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
