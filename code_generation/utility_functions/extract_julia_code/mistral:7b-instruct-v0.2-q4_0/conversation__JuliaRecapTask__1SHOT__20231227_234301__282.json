X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions to match code blocks using regexr.jl (optional but recommended for better performance).\n   - String manipulation functions like `rstrip`, `split`, and `join`.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n  code_blocks = []\n\n  # Match all the code blocks using regex pattern\n  pattern = r\"(```[jl]{1,2}|'')\\s*(.*?)\\1\"\n  matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n  for match in matches\n    code_block = String(match.replacement)\n    # Remove the first and last triple backticks or single quotes\n    code_block = rstrip(code_block, \"```\" * ')' * '|' * \"'\")\n    push!(code_blocks, code_block)\n  end\n\n  # Join all the code blocks with a newline character\n  extracted_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n  return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - The function `extract_julia_code` accepts an AbstractString `md` as its argument representing a markdown document.\n   - It uses regex pattern to match all code blocks and extract them from the markdown document by removing triple backticks or single quotes.\n   - All extracted code blocks are joined together using a newline character.\n   - The function returns the final extracted code as a String.\n\nYou can test this function with different markdown documents to ensure it is working correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[393,422],"elapsed":15.356627416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
