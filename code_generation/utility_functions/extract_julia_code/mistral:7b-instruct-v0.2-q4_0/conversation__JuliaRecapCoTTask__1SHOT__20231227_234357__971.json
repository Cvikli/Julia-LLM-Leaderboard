[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on your special instruction, here's how I would approach the problem:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- Regular expressions for matching code blocks (`r\"````[jl]\"` and `r\"([^]]*)\"`)\n- String manipulation functions like `strip()`, `replace()`, and string concatenation\n- Function definition and usage\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\nFirst, we define our function `extract_julia_code` which takes a markdown document as its argument. We use regular expressions to find all code blocks in the document and extract their content. We then join those contents together with newlines and remove any leading or trailing whitespace using the `strip()` function.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    regex = r\"```(jl)\\s*(.*?)\\s*```\"\n    matches = matchall(regex, md) do m\n        content = m[:2]\n        content = strip(content)\n        join([content], \"\\n\")\n    end\n\n    # join extracted code blocks with newline character\n    return join(matches, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nTo ensure our solution is working as expected, we can test it with a sample markdown document and compare the result to the actual code blocks. We can create a simple markdown file `test.md` for this purpose:\n\n```markdown\n```julia\nusing LinearAlgebra\nA = rand(3)\nB = A' * A\neigvals, eigvecs = eig(B)\n```\n```\n\nWe then call our function `extract_julia_code` to extract the code blocks and test it against the expected output:\n\n```julia\nusing LinearAlgebra, REPLace\nmd = \"\"\"\n```julia\nusing LinearAlgebra\nA = rand(3)\nB = A' * A\neigvals, eigvecs = eig(B)\n\"\"\"\nexpected_code = \"\"\"\nusing LinearAlgebra\n\nA = rand(3)\nB = A' * A\neigvals, eigvecs = eig(B)\n\"\"\"\n\nif extract_julia_code(md) == expected_code\n    println(\"Solution is correct!\")\nelse\n    println(\"Solution is incorrect.\")\nend\n```\n\nThe output should be \"Solution is correct!\" if our function works as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[395,594],"elapsed":21.0841675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
