[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the provided task and special instructions, here's how to approach it using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Reading markdown files with Regex or regular expressions.\n   - String manipulation functions like `split`, `join` and string interpolation.\n   - Regular expression patterns for identifying code blocks.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n  pattern = r\"^```(\\S+)\\n(?:\\s*(.*?)(?=```|\\z))+\"\n  matches = match(md, pattern) do m\n    code_block = m[2]\n    code_blocks = split(code_block, r\"\\n```\")\n    [join(code_blocks, \"\\n\") for code_block in code_blocks]\n  end\n  return join(matches, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown string as an argument and uses regular expressions to extract the code blocks. It then splits each block by newline characters that follow triple backticks and joins the resulting parts with a newline character. The final result is an array of joined code blocks, which are then combined using the `join` function with a newline character between each code block.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Test the function on various markdown strings containing different Julia code snippets to ensure it correctly extracts and joins them together as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[395,348],"elapsed":12.9083615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
