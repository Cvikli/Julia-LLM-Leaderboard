Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the given problem statement, here's how I would approach writing a `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expression pattern for code blocks\n    pattern = r\"```(.*?)(\\r\\n)?```\"\n    \n    # Match all code blocks and extract their content using the defined pattern\n    matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Join the extracted code blocks with newlines\n    extracted_code = join([c.match for c in matches], \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Return the extracted Julia code as a string\n    extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a single argument `md` of type `AbstractString`, which represents the Markdown document as a string. It uses regular expressions to match and extract all the code blocks in the document, removes the code fences, joins the extracted code blocks together with newlines, and finally returns the extracted Julia code as a string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that each code block is preceded and followed by exactly one line of newline character (`\\r\\n`). If there are cases where the code block might not have a trailing newline or might have multiple newlines, the regular expression pattern and/or the extraction logic in the function would need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[222,310],"elapsed":10.596341042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
