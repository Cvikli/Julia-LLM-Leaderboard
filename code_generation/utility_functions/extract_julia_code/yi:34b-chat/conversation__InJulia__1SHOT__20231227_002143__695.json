Replacing all occurrences of ````julia` and ````` (with optional `-` for line breaks) at the beginning of a line with an empty string. This removes the code fences.\n2. Splitting the markdown document into lines, discarding any leading and trailing whitespace from each line.\n3. Joining the lines back together with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks within the Julia code blocks, and it does not preserve any formatting or metadata within the code blocks. It simply extracts the text between the code fences and joins them together.","status":200,"tokens":[88,313],"elapsed":41.903063958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
