Below is an example of how the function `extract_julia_code` might be implemented in Python to extract and join Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n\n```python\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    import re\n    # Regular expression to match fenced code blocks with language 'julia'\n    fenced_code_block = r'''\n    ({0})?\\n\n    (~{3,}|-{3,}-[ ])\n    (.*?)\n    (\\1?\\n)\n    '''.format('\\n')\n\n    # Use a list comprehension to create a single string from all code blocks\n    julia_code = '\\n'.join([re.search(fenced_code_block, line).group(2) for line in md.splitlines() if re.search(fenced_code_block, line)])\n\n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the joined code blocks\n    julia_code = julia_code.strip()\n\n    return julia_code\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to match fenced code blocks with the `julia` language. It then joins all such code blocks together, removing the leading and trailing whitespace. Note that this example assumes that the Markdown document is provided as a string `md`.","status":200,"tokens":[85,298],"elapsed":39.753861875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
