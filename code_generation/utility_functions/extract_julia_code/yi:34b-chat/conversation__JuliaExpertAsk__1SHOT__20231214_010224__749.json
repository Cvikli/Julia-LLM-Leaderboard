Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Ah, an excellent question! I can definitely help you with that.\n\nTo extract all the Julia code blocks from a Markdown document, we can use a combination of regular expressions and a few string manipulation functions in Julia. Here's a simple implementation:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use regular expressions to find all code blocks\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r\"```([A-Za-z0-9_]+)\", md)\n\n    # Remove the code fences\n    code_blocks = [CodeScanner.remove_fence(c) for c in code_blocks]\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function takes a Markdown document as input, and returns a single string containing all the extracted Julia code blocks, with any code fences removed and joined together with a newline.\n\nOf course, this is just one way to solve this problem, and there are many other approaches you could take depending on your specific needs. But I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.","status":200,"tokens":[118,276],"elapsed":9.715778458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
