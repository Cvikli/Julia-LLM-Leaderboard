[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia to extract all the code blocks, remove code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use the Markdown.jl library to parse the markdown document\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Extract all the code blocks\n    code_blocks = findall(doc, Node[:code])\n\n    # Remove any code fences\n    code_blocks = [c -> c.value[1:end-2] for c in code_blocks];\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\");\n\n    return joined_code;\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* `Markdown.parse(md::String)` parses the markdown document using the Markdown.jl library. The result is a `Doc` object representing the document.\n* `findall(doc, Node[:code])` finds all the code blocks in the document using the `Node[:code]` pattern. This pattern matches any node that has the `:code` attribute set to `true`.\n* `[c -> c.value[1:end-2] for c in code_blocks]` removes any code fences from the code blocks. A code fence is a line that starts with `--` and ends with `--`. By removing these lines, we are left with just the code block contents.\n* `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")` joins all the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`).\n\nThe function returns the joined code block string.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[89,419],"elapsed":14.210723083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
