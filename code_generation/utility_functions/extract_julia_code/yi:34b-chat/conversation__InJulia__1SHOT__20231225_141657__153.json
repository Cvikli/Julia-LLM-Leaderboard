It does this by iterating over each line of the document, looking for lines that start and end with three backticks (`````) to identify code fences. When it finds a code fence, it removes the backticks and adds the content to the extracted code. Once it encounters the closing code fence (the ````` line), it stops adding more lines. Finally, it strips leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted code to ensure it's clean.","status":200,"tokens":[88,447],"elapsed":59.11446425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
