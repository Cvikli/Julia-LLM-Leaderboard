Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Since you provided no special instructions, I will prioritize the guidelines for solving problems in Julia language. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* `if-elseif-else` control structures\n\t* `function` and `anonymous` functions\n\t* Array operations (e.g., `a[1:2]`)\n\t* Slicing (`a[1:2]`)\n\t* Tuples (`(1, 2)`)\n\t* Namedtuples (`; name=\"Julia\"` syntax)\n\t* Dictionary (`Dict(\"key\" => value\")` syntax)\n\t* String interpolation with `$` symbol\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Read the markdown document `md` and extract all code blocks using regular expressions or other techniques.\n\t* Remove any code fences (e.g., `end`) from the extracted code blocks.\n\t* Join the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`).\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the extracted code blocks are indeed Julia language code blocks.\n\t* Ensure that the code blocks are joined correctly without any syntax errors.\n\nNow, let's begin the task! Please provide the markdown document `md` for me to extract the Julia code blocks and solve the task.","status":200,"tokens":[389,327],"elapsed":15.35452575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
