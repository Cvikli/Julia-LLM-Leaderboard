Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that does what you described:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = split.(replace.(md, r\"^```\\n(.*?)\\n```$\", r\"\\1\"), \"\\n\")\n    join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function takes an AbstractString (a Markdown document) as input and returns a String containing the Julia code blocks joined with newlines. The `split` function is used to separate the code block from its fences and the `replace` function is used to remove the fences. Then, all code blocks are joined together using the `join` function","status":200,"tokens":[126,171],"elapsed":6.260476,"_type":"aimessage"}]
