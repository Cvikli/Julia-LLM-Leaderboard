Then it iterates over each block node in the parsed document and checks if the block is a code fence with triple backticks (denoted by the `:fence` keyword argument). If it is, the content of the code fence is appended to a list of code blocks. Finally, all the code blocks are joined together with newlines using the `join()` function and returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[94,250],"elapsed":7.838577416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
