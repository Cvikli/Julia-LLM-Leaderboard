Here's an example implementation of a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia that does what you described:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::Markdown)\n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in md.lines\n        if line[0] == '```' && line[len('```\")] == '```'\n            push!(code_blocks, line[2:end])\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove code fences\n    code_blocks = Filter{String}(code_blocks, line -> line != '' && line != '```')\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```\nusing Markdown\n\n# Generate some sample Markdown text with Julia code blocks\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Hello world!\n\n```julia\nprintln(\"Hello, world!\");\n```\n\n```julia\nx = 10;\ny = 20;\nz = x + y;\n```\n```scss\n.class {\n    background-color: #ff0000;\n}\n```\n```bash\necho \"Hello, world!\"\n```\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the Julia code blocks\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\n\n# Print the extracted code\nprintln(extracted_code)\n```\nThis should output the following:\n```\nhello, world!\n\nx = 10;\ny = 20;\nz = x + y;\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that each code block is surrounded by a line of triple quotes (`````). If your Markdown text has different syntax for code blocks, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[89,433],"elapsed":14.776336334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
