[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution for extracting the code blocks from a markdown document and joining them together:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = []\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for i in eachindex(lines)\n        if lines[i] == \"```\" && (i == 1 || lines[i-1] != \"```\")\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif lines[i] == \"```\" && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, join(lines[i+1:findprev(==(\"```\"), lines, i+1)], \"\\n\"))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function `extract_julia_code` takes a markdown document as input and returns a string that contains the code blocks joined together. It uses regular expressions to split the input into lines, then iterates over the lines to identify and extract the code blocks. The code block identification is based on the presence of triple backticks (```) at the start and end of the block.","status":200,"tokens":[135,288],"elapsed":9.270266584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
