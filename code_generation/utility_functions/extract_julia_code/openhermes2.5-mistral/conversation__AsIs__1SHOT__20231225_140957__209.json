It then splits the document into individual lines and iterates over each line to identify and extract code blocks using the \"julia\" language identifier. If a code block is found, it is appended to the `code_blocks` array after removing the code fences (\"```\") that enclose it. Finally, all code blocks are joined together with newlines and returned as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[91,265],"elapsed":8.276672083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
