[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

We can achieve this by parsing the Markdown as a string and using regular expressions. Here's how we do it:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Import required packages\nusing DataStructures\nusing Pipe\n\n# Step 2: Define the extract_julia_code function\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Step 3: Extract all code blocks and remove surrounding triple backticks\n    code_blocks = filter(x -> startswith(x, \"```\") && endswith(x, \"```\"), md)\n    code_str = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the extracted and joined code blocks as a string\n    return code_str\nend\n```\n\nNow `extract_julia_code` is a function that takes an AbstractString (a Markdown document) and returns a String containing all Julia code blocks without their surrounding triple backticks.","status":200,"tokens":[402,259],"elapsed":9.828915875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
