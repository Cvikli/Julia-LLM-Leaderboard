[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    code_blocks = [line for line in lines if startswith(line, \"```\")]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks[2:end-1], \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe solution defines a function `extract_julia_code` that takes an `md` string of markdown text. It first splits the string into lines and identifies code blocks by checking if the line starts with three backticks (```). It then extracts the code blocks from the start and end delimiters, joins them together using a newline character, and returns the result as a single String.","status":200,"tokens":[400,187],"elapsed":7.593333875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
