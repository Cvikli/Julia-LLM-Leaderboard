If a line is \"```\" (indicating the start of a code block) and the next line does not start with a hash symbol (denoting a header), then the function pushes that code block to an array `code_blocks`. The function continues this process until it reaches the end of the document or finds the end of the code block.\n\nFinally, the function joins all the code blocks together with newlines and returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[94,304],"elapsed":9.519019833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
