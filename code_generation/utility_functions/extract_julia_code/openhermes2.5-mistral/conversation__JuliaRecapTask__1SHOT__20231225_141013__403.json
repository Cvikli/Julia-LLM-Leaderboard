[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function `extract_julia_code` to extract all the code blocks from a markdown document, remove code fences, and join them together with newlines:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    code_blocks = []\n    \n    in_code_block = false\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if line == \"```\" && i > 1 && lines[i-1] != \"\"\n            in_code_block = !in_code_block\n            pushfirst!(code_blocks, line)\n        elseif in_code_block\n            push!(code_blocks, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if code_blocks[1][2:end] == \"```\"\n        return join(code_blocks[3:-1:2], \"\\n\")\n    else\n        return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n- The function takes a string `md`, which is the markdown document.\n- It splits the string into individual lines using the '\\n' character.\n- Then it iterates through each line, checking if it is a code fence (`\" \"`). If it is and it is not an empty line or the first line of the document, it toggles the `in_code_block` flag to indicate whether we are in a code block or not.\n- If we are in a code block, it adds the line to the `code_blocks` array.\n- After iterating through all lines, if the first character of the first code block is an opening fence (i.e., `\" \"`), it removes the opening fence and joins all remaining code blocks with newlines. Otherwise, it simply joins all code blocks with newlines.\n\nThis function will extract all code blocks from a markdown document, remove the code fences, and join them together with newlines as specified in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[400,460],"elapsed":16.267191708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
