[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and special instructions, here is how I would approach this task using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- Reading markdown files: `readfile`, `re` regular expressions, `r\"(^``{3,}|(\\\\.|[^`]*)(`{3,}$)\"` pattern for detecting code blocks\n- String manipulation: `join`, `split`\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    julia_blocks = []\n\n    for line in lines\n        match = match(r\"(^``{3,}|(\\\\.|[^`]*)(`{3,}$)\", line)\n        if isnothing(match) || startswith(line, \"```\") && endswith(line, \"```\")\n            continue\n        end\n        code_block = match.match\n\n        push!(julia_blocks, String[code_block[3:end-1]])\n    end\n\n    return join(julia_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `extract_julia_code()` function reads a given markdown string, processes each line to detect code blocks using regular expressions, and stores them in an array. Once all lines have been processed, it joins the code blocks together with newlines and returns the result as a string.\n\nThis solution should correctly extract Julia code blocks from a markdown document, remove their fences, and return a single string containing the extracted code.\n\nSince the special instructions do not specify any performance concerns or explicit package dependencies, I've followed the standard problem-solving steps and used only built-in Julia functions.","status":200,"tokens":[395,424],"elapsed":25.398311084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
