[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets for working with strings, regular expressions, and code blocks in markdown documents.\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    regex = r\"^```(.*)?\\n(.*?)\\n```\" # Regular expression pattern for code fences and code blocks\n    matches = matchall(regex, md)\n    extracted_codes = []\n    for match in matches\n        pushfirst!(extracted_codes, String(match[2]))\n    end\n    return join(extracted_codes, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check the solution:\n\nThe `extract_julia_code()` function uses a regular expression pattern to extract the code blocks from an input markdown document string and joins them together with newlines.\n\nIt first defines a regular expression (regex) pattern for code fences and code blocks, which matches any line starting with three or more backticks followed by any characters up to the next occurrence of code fences, and then any code content between those code fence lines. The second capturing group `(.*?)` is used to extract the actual code block content.\n\nThe function uses the `matchall()` built-in function to find all matches for this pattern within the input markdown document string. It then iterates through the matches and pushes each extracted code block into a vector called `extracted_codes`. Finally, it returns the joined result of all the extracted codes with newline characters using the `join()` function.\n\nThis solution should correctly extract and join Julia code blocks from an input markdown document string, as requested in the problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[395,400],"elapsed":24.000792041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
