X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - String manipulation functions: `split`, `join`, `rstrip`\n   - Regular expressions: `match` with the `r\"(?s)^\\n`` pattern\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n  lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n  result = String[]\n  pushfirst!(result, \"\")\n\n  for line in lines\n    if isnothing(match(r\"^```(.+?)\\s*(.*)$\", line))\n      push!(result, line)\n    else\n      code_block = match(r\"^```(.+?)\\s*(.*)$\", line).captures[2]\n      push!(result, strip(code_block, \" \\t\"))\n      lines[findfirst(isequal(line), lines)] = \"\" # remove the code fence from the original markdown document\n    end\n  end\n\n  joined_code = join(result, \"\\n\") # join all the extracted code blocks with a newline character\n  return joined_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - The function `extract_julia_code` extracts all the code blocks from an input markdown document, removes the code fences and joins them together with a newline character.\n   - It returns a String containing all the extracted code blocks.\n   - No external packages are used, following the guidelines provided.","status":200,"tokens":[395,379],"elapsed":22.84353925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
