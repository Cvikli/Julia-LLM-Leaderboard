X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Based on the information provided, here are the steps I will follow to extract the Julia code from the markdown document:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\nBefore starting the extraction process, I will quickly scan the markdown document to identify any useful Julia snippets that could be helpful in solving the task. These snippets might include common functions, variables, or syntax elements that are commonly used in Julia programming.\n2. Solve the Task:\nUsing the recalled snippets and the information provided in the problem statement, I will start extracting the code blocks from the markdown document. I will search for any lines that start with a backtick (``) or a triple-backtick (```) characters, which are used to denote code fences in Julia. Once I find a code block, I will remove the surrounding code fences and join the code block with a newline character.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nAfter extracting all the code blocks from the markdown document, I will double-check each block to ensure it is correctly formatted and free of errors. If any issues are found, I will correct them before proceeding with the next step.\n4. Return the extracted code:\nFinally, I will return the extracted Julia code as a string.\n\nHere's an example of how I would implement the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Step 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n    useful_snippets = [\"x = 10\", \"if x > 0 then x^2 else x^3\", \"for i in 1:5\"]\n\n    # Step 2: Solve the Task\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in md lines do\n        if line[1] == '`' || line[1] == '''''\n            # Remove code fences and join code blocks\n            code_block = line[2:end]\n            code_block = code_block[:length(code_block) - 2] # Remove last two backticks\n            code_block = code_block %>% paste0( newline() ) # Join with a newline character\n            code_blockspush!(code_blocks, code_block)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Step 3: Double-check the solution\n    for code_block in code_blocks\n        if !isvalidjulia(code_block)\n            error(\"Invalid Julia code block: $code_block\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted Julia code\n    return code_blocks %>% paste0(newline()) # Join all code blocks with a newline character\nend\n```\nIn this example, `useful_snippets` is a list of useful Julia snippets that I recall from the problem statement. The function then iterates over each line in the markdown document, checks if it's a code block using the `isvalidjulia` function, and adds it to the `code_blocks` list if it's valid. Finally, the function returns the joined Julia code blocks as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[389,709],"elapsed":30.334843083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
