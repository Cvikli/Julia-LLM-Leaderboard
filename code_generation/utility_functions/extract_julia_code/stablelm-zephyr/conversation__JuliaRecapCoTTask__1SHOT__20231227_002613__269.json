[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific instructions provided by a user named \"{{instructions}}\". \n\nHowever, based on your task description and the guidelines you've mentioned, here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\nresult = \"\"\n\nfor line in Lines(File(\"${basedir}/Markdown/README.md\"}\", \"r\"))\n# Check if the line is a code block header\nif line == \"## Code Blocks\"\ncontinue\nend\n\ncode_lines = SplitLines(line)\nif length(code_lines) >= 2 && code_lines[1] != \"# Code Blocks\"\nresult += String(\"\"\"\"\nfor i = 1:length(code_lines)-1\nresult += code_lines[i] + \"\\n\"\nend\nresult += \"\\n\"\"\")\nend\n\n# Check for multiple code blocks and join them if found\nif length(LinesInBlock(line)) > 1 && !is_multiple_blocks(line)\nfor I = 2:length(LinesInBlock(line))\nif LinesInBlock(line)[i] == \"\" && LinesInBlock(line)[1..-1] != \"# Code Blocks\"\nresult += String(\"\"\"\"\nfor j = 1:length(LinesInBlock(line)-1)\nresult += LinesInBlock(line)[j] + \"\\n\"\nend\nresult += \"\\n\"\"\")\nelse\nbreak\nend\nend\nend\n\n# Check for new instructions and ignore them if found\nif line != \"\" && contains(line, \"{{instructions}})\", ignore_line)\ncontinue\nend\nend\n\nreturn result\nend\n\nfunction is_multiple_blocks(line)\nbegin, end = LinesInBlock(line)\nreturn begin == \"# Code Blocks\" || end != \"\\n\" && length(begin) > 1\nend\n```\nThis function reads the `README.md` file line by line and checks for code block headers, multiple code blocks within a single line, and instructions containing \"{{instructions}}\". It ignores the special instruction you mentioned and handles line wrapping correctly (e.g., when a block spans multiple lines).","status":200,"tokens":[383,540],"elapsed":11.5302565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
