[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should do the trick:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code()\n# Define the regex pattern to match code fences and Julia syntax\npattern = r\"(?m)^\\s*\\{\\s*\\}[^{]*(?:--|if|while)\\s*(?:[\\n\\r\\f]|$)\"\n\n# Read the input markdown document as a string\ninput_string = String(\"\"\"<h1>Header</h1>\\n\\n\n{# This is a code fence\na = 3\n}\n\"\"\")\n\n# Replace the code fences with the regex pattern and remove leading/trailing whitespace\ncleaned_string = replace(input_string, pattern, \"joined_code$1\", all=true)\ncleaned_string = gsub(r\"\\s+\", \" \", cleaned_string)\n\n# Split the cleaned string into multiple lines (if any), joining them with a newline\nlines = split(cleaned_string, \"\\n\")\nresult = join(\"\", lines)\n\nreturn result\nend\n```\nThis function uses regex to match code fences (`\\{` and `\\}`) and replaces the enclosed Julia code blocks with \"joined_code$1\". It then removes leading/trailing whitespace from the resulting string, splits it into multiple lines (if any), and joins them together using a newline. The output will be a single continuous string of Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[133,332],"elapsed":6.102564833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
