You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a function `extract_julia_code` that does what you described:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if line[1:] == \"```julia\"\n           push! code_blocks lines[2:end]\n        else\n            continue\n        end\n    end\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\") + \"\\n\"\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* `split(md, \"\\n\")` splits the input Markdown document into a list of lines, using the newline character as the delimiter.\n* The loop iterates over each line in the list, and checks if the line starts with `\"```julia\".` If it does, the function adds the remaining lines in the block to a list called `code_blocks`.\n* Once all code blocks have been processed, the function joins the code blocks together using the newline character as the delimiter, and returns the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is only one code block in the input Markdown document. If there are multiple code blocks, the function will join them together without adding a new line between them. If you need to handle multiple code blocks with different nesting levels or indentation, you may want to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[118,320],"elapsed":11.215047583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
