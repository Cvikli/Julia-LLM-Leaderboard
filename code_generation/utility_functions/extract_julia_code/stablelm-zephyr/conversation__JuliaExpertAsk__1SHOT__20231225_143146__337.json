If a line contains an HTML code fence, it skips that line. Otherwise, if there is a preformatted or code block starting on the current line, it extracts its contents and adds them to the result string along with their surrounding whitespace. It also handles any other text content in each line as usual. Finally, it joins all code blocks together with newlines between them.","status":200,"tokens":[133,411],"elapsed":7.474726542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
