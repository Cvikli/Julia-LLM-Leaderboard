Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Here is an example of how you could create a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences, and joins the code blocks together with a newline:\n```\nimport Markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md_document: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all Julia code blocks from a Markdown document.\n\n    Args:\n        md_document (str): The Markdown document containing the Julia code blocks.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The extracted Julia code blocks, with code fences removed and joined together with a newline.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parse the Markdown document using the Markdown Python library\n    doc = Markdown(md_document)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks in the document\n    code_blocks = [block for block in doc.iter_blocks() if isinstance(block, Markdown.Block)]\n\n    # Remove code fences from each code block\n    code_blocks = [block.render() for block in code_blocks]\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n\n    return joined_code\n```\nTo use this function, you can call it with the Markdown document as an argument, like so:\n```\n extracted_code = extract_julia_code(\"MyMarkdownDocument.md\")\n print(extracted_code)\n```\nThis should output the extracted Julia code blocks, with any code fences removed and joined together with a newline.
