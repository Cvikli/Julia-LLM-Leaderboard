This function uses the `rstrip()` method to remove any code fence (`\"{\" \" \"` at the end of each code block, and the `splitlines()` method to split the code blocks into an array of strings:\n\n```javascript\nfunction extract_julia_code()\ncontent = String(strip(readline()))\n\n# Split lines with code fences and remove them\ncode_blocks = content.match(r\"'(?<=\\s|\\d{1,3})'''?{(?:[^{}]|\\[|\\\\)}?(?= \\))\", \"g\")\n.splitlines()\n\n# Join code blocks with a newline and remove extra spaces at the beginning/end of each line\nformatted_code = join(map(rstrip, code_blocks))\n\nreturn formatted_code\n```\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes there are no nested fences within a single string. If you need to handle such cases, you may need a more complex regular expression pattern.","status":200,"tokens":[96,242],"elapsed":4.265771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
