[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I understand the task. Here is a function that should fulfill your requirements:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md: String)\nresult = \"\"\n\n# Find all code blocks in the markdown document\nblocks = []\nfor line in lines(strip(md))\nif startsline(\":---\", line) && endsline(\"---\", line)\nblocks += parse.(CodeBlock, readlines(strip(line), Array{String}))\nend\nend\n\n# Remove code fences and join the blocks together with newlines\nfor block in blocks\nresult += join(strip(block.content)) + \"\\n\"\nend\n\nreturn result\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating through each line of the input markdown string (stripped to remove any leading/trailing whitespace), and checking for `:---` as a prefix, followed by a newline character (`\\n`) and then `---` as a suffix. When it finds such a pattern, it considers that block as a code block and adds its content to the result string after removing the fences with `join`.\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[383,265],"elapsed":5.95770025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
