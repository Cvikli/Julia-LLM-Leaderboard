The result is returned as a single string containing all the code blocks.\n\nYou can use this function to extract code from your Julia markdown document like this:\n```javascript\njoined_code = extract_julia_code()\nprintln(joined_code)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[96,462],"elapsed":8.278985625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
