[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! I'm glad you provided the Julia language syntax and guidelines. Based on the task, I will follow these steps to extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document `md`:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `CodeFence` package for parsing markdown code blocks\n\t* `Markdown` package for parsing markdown syntax\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Use `CodeFence.parse_code()` function to extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document\n\t* Remove any code fences using `CodeFence.remove_fences()` function\n\t* Join the code blocks together with a newline using `String.join()` function\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Use `CodeFence.parse_code()` function again to verify that the extracted code blocks are correct\n\t* Check that there are no extra newlines or unwanted characters in the joined code block\n\nHere's the implemented function `extract_julia_code()`:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse markdown document\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n    \n    # Extract Julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = CodeFence.parse_code(doc)\n    \n    # Remove code fences\n    code_blocks = CodeFence.remove_fences(code_blocks)\n    \n    # Join code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = String.join((code_block), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nNote that this implementation uses the `CodeFence` package for parsing markdown code blocks and the `String` module for joining the code blocks together. You can test the function by passing in a markdown document with Julia code blocks, and it should output the extracted Julia code block with no code fences and joined together with a newline.","status":200,"tokens":[11,432],"elapsed":15.827503375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
