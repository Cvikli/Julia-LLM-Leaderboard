The regex looks for triple backticks possibly followed by \"julia\" and a newline, then captures everything until another set of triple backticks or a non-escaped newline, which is assumed to be the end of the code block. \n\nAfter matching all the code blocks, it maps each match to its captured code (excluding the backticks and language) and joins them with a newline. The resulting string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[100,305],"elapsed":40.403404375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
