This function finds all matches of Julia code blocks in the given markdown document and joins them together with newlines.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Regular expression pattern to match julia code blocks\n    pattern = r'```julia\\n(?P<code>(.*?\\n)*?)```'\n    \n    # Find all matches in the markdown document\n    matches = re.finditer(pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the code from each match and join them together with a newline\n    return \"\\n\".join([match.group(\"code\").strip() for match in matches])\n```\nThis function assumes that the given markdown document `md` is a string, and uses the regular expression pattern '````julia\\n(?P<code>(.*?\\n)*?)```' to match Julia code blocks. The named group 'code' captures the content of the code block, excluding the starting and ending fences. The `finditer` function returns an iterator yielding match objects for all non-overlapping occurrences of pattern in string. Finally, a list comprehension is used to extract the captured code from each match and join them together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[97,292],"elapsed":38.332252667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
