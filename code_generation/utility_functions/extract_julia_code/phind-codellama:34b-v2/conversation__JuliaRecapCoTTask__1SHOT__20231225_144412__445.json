[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Then we will remove the starting and ending fences \"```\" from each code block and join them together with a newline character. \n\nHere is the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all the julia code blocks in markdown document\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.|\\n)*?```\", md)\n\n    # Remove starting and ending fences \"```\" from each code block \n    # and join them together with a newline character\n    return join((m.captures[1] for m in code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function assumes that the markdown document is properly formatted and that there are no other languages used in code blocks except Julia (i.e., the fences always start with \"```julia\"). If this is not the case, you would need to adjust the regular expression accordingly or use a more sophisticated method of extracting code blocks from markdown documents.","status":200,"tokens":[403,266],"elapsed":41.892962416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
