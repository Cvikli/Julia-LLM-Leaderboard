X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Based on the problem statement and guidelines provided, here is my systematic approach to solving the task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* `code_block()` function from the `Markdown` package to extract code blocks from the markdown document.\n\t* `String` manipulation functions such as `split()`, `join()`, and `replace()` to clean up the extracted code blocks.\n\t* `parse()` function from the `Julia` package to parse the extracted code blocks and remove fences.\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Use `code_block()` to extract all code blocks from the markdown document.\n\t* Split the extracted code blocks into separate strings using `split()`.\n\t* Remove fences from each code block using `parse()`.\n\t* Join the cleaned-up code blocks together with a newline using `join()`.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the extracted code blocks are correct and match the original markdown document.\n\t* Check that the fences have been removed correctly and the code blocks are now standalone strings.\n\nHere's the implemented function `extract_julia_code()`:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Extract code blocks from markdown document\n    code_blocks = code_block(md)\n    \n    # Split code blocks into separate strings\n    code_strings = split(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Remove fences from each code block\n    code_strings_fence_free = map(parse, code_strings)\n    \n    # Join cleaned-up code blocks together with a newline\n    extracted_julia_code = join(code_strings_fence_free, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return extracted_julia_code\nend\n```\nNote: The `AbstractString` type is used as the input parameter for `extract_julia_code()` to accommodate markdown documents that may contain raw Julia code in them.","status":200,"tokens":[389,483],"elapsed":21.226408083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
