It collects all code blocks that are identified by the presence of \"julia\" after three backticks (i.e., ````julia). For each code block, it removes the backticks at the beginning and end of the block and stores the remaining code in an array. Finally, it concatenates all the code blocks into a single string with newline characters between them.","status":200,"tokens":[100,251],"elapsed":33.206375666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
