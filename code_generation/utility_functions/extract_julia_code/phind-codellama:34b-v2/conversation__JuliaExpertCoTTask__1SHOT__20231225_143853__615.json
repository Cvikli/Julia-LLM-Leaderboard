It then uses the `eachmatch` function to find all matches of this pattern in the input string `md`. For each matched block, it removes any leading spaces and appends the code to the end of a vector `julia_code_blocks`. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline character and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[232,287],"elapsed":40.720831167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
