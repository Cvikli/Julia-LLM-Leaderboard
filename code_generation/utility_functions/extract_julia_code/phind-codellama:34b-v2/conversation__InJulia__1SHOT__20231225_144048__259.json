The `[\\s\\S]*?` part of the regex is used to match any character (including newlines) between the code fences, as few times as possible (`*?` is a non-greedy quantifier). Then it extracts the captured codes and joins them with a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested code blocks and all code blocks start and end with three backticks (`` ``` ```).","status":200,"tokens":[100,252],"elapsed":33.374326625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
