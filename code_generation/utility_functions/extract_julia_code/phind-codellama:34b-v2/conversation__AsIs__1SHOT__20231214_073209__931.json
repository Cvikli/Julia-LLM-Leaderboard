Here's an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` to extract all the Julia code blocks, remove code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline:\n```\nimport Markdown\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md: Markdown) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all the Julia code blocks from a Markdown document.\n\n    Args:\n        md (Markdown): The Markdown document containing the Julia code blocks.\n\n    Yields:\n        str: The extracted Julia code blocks, without code fences and joined together with a newline.\n    \"\"\"\n    for code_block in md.code_blocks:\n        yield extract_julia_code_block(code_block)\n\ndef extract_julia_code_block(code_block: CodeBlock) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts a single Julia code block from a Markdown document.\n\n    Args:\n        code_block (CodeBlock): The Julia code block to extract.\n\n    Yields:\n        str: The extracted Julia code, without code fences.\n    \"\"\"\n    yield code_block.text\n```\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n# This is a comment\n\n# Another comment\n\n```\nimport Printf\n\n# This is a Julia code block\n@code_block\nfunction fib(n)\n    if n <= 1\n        return n\n    else\n        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\nend\nend\n```\nYou can call the `extract_julia_code` function with the Markdown document as an argument, like this:\n```\nextracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\nprint(extracted_code)\n```\nThis should output the extracted Julia code block without any code fences or indentation.","status":200,"tokens":[72,442],"elapsed":15.015280584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
