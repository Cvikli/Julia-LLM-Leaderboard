Here's an example implementation of a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences, and joins the code blocks together with a newline:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all code blocks in the Markdown document\n    code_blocks = findall(md, r\"``` julia\")\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = Join[map(x -> x.subs(\"```\", \"\"), code_blocks)]\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\n# Load the Markdown document\nmd = read(\"document.md\")\n\n# Extract the Julia code blocks\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\n\n# Print the extracted Julia code\nprintln(code)\n```\nNote that this implementation uses the `findall` function from the `String` module to find all occurrences of the pattern ``` julia```, which is enclosed in double quotes (`\"`). The `map` function is then used to apply a transformation to each match, which in this case replaces the ```` with an empty string. Finally, the `Join` function is used to join the code blocks together with a newline character (`\\n`).","status":200,"tokens":[89,319],"elapsed":10.817857708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
