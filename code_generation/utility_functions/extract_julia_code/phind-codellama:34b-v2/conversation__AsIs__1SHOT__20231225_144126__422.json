If it encounters a line starting with ```julia, it knows that it has entered a julia code block. It then starts collecting lines in `current_block` until it encounters a line starting with ```, which indicates the end of the code block. After encountering the end of a code block, it adds the collected block to `code_blocks` and resets `current_block`. At the end, it joins all the collected code blocks with newline characters in between.","status":200,"tokens":[97,290],"elapsed":38.042669708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
