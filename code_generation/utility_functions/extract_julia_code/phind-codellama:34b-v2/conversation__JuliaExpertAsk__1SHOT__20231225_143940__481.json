Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia([\\s\\S]*?)```\", md)\n    return join(map(x -> x.captures[1], code_blocks), \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match all Julia code blocks in the given markdown document. The `[\\s\\S]*?` part of the regular expression matches any character (including newlines) between the code block delimiters as few times as possible, which ensures that it captures only the code within each pair of delimiters.\n\nThe `map` function is then used to extract the captured code from each match and remove the code fences. The resulting array of strings (each representing a code block) is joined together with newline characters between them.","status":200,"tokens":[139,201],"elapsed":27.743340792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
