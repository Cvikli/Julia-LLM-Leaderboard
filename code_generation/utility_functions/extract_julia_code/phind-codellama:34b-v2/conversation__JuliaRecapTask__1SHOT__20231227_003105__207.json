[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n- Read the entire markdown document line by line.\n- If a line starts with \"```julia\" or \"~~~julia\", it marks the start of a Julia code block. Keep reading lines until you encounter a line that is just \"```\" or \"~~~\". All the lines in between are part of the same code block and will be joined together without any modifications.\n- Repeat this process until there are no more lines left to read.\n\nHere's how we can implement this function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    julia_blocks = []\n    inside_block = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if inside_block\n            if startswith(line, \"```\") || startswith(line, \"~~~\")\n                inside_block = false\n            else\n                push!(julia_blocks, line)\n            end\n        else\n            if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || startswith(line, \"~~~julia\")\n                inside_block = true\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(julia_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function goes through each line in the markdown document. If it's currently inside a Julia code block (denoted by `inside_block`), it checks if the current line marks the end of the code block. If so, it sets `inside_block` to false and continues to the next line.\n\nIf it's not inside a code block, it checks if the current line marks the start of a Julia code block. If so, it sets `inside_block` to true.\n\nFinally, it joins all the lines in the Julia code blocks together with newline characters in between and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[400,430],"elapsed":63.6382975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
