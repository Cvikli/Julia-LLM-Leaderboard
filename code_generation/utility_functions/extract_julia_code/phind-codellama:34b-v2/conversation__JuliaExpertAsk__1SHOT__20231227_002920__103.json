Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution using the `Markdown` package from Julia's ecosystem.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Parse markdown string to Markdown.MD object\n    md_object = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    # Iterate over all elements in the MD object\n    for el in md_object.content\n        if isa(el, Markdown.Code) && (occursin(\"julia\", el.language) || isempty(el.language))\n            # Remove code fences and push content to code_blocks\n            push!(code_blocks, strip(el.code, '\\n'))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join all the code blocks with a newline and return\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function works by first parsing the provided markdown string into a Markdown.MD object. It then iterates over all elements in this object. If an element is a code block (`Markdown.Code`) and its language is either \"julia\" or empty (in which case it's assumed to be julia), the function removes the code fences (```julia) and pushes the content into a `code_blocks` array. Finally, all the contents of the `code_blocks` array are joined together with newline characters in between and returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[139,335],"elapsed":44.764931917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
