[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    julia_blocks = filter(line -> startswith(line, \"```julia\"), lines)\n    julia_blocks = map(x->x[7:end-3], julia_blocks)\n    return join([join(lines_of_block, '\\n') for lines_of_block in julia_blocks]) * '\\n'\nend\n```\n\nIn the `extract_julia_code` function above, we follow these steps:\n1. Split the markdown document into lines using a newline character as the delimiter (`split(md, '\\n')`). This allows us to easily iterate through each line of code.\n2. Filter out all lines that start with \"```julia\" using the `filter` function and the `startswith` method. This ensures we only keep the Julia code blocks.\n3. Map over the resulting array of code block lines, removing the opening and closing triple backticks (\"```\") from each line using slicing (`map(x->x[7:end-3], julia_blocks)`). This gives us a new array with just the Julia code lines inside the blocks.\n4. Use list comprehension to join all the code lines within a block together and add a newline character after each block using `join([join(lines_of_block, '\\n') for lines_of_block in julia_blocks]) * '\\n'`. This ensures that the resulting string has newlines between each block of Julia code.\n5. Finally, return the joined string as the output.","status":200,"tokens":[399,377],"elapsed":74.755992334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
