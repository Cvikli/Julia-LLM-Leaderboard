It then searches for the starting and ending indices of the Julia code blocks and extracts them as separate strings, joining them together with newlines if there are multiple blocks. If no code blocks are found, an empty string is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[88,328],"elapsed":55.889058917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
