[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"We can use Julia's built-in `match` function to find all the code blocks, then extract their contents and join them together. Here's the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Find all markdown code fences\n    matches = match.(r\"```julia\\n(?<code>[\\w\\W]+?)\\n```\", md) |> collect\n    \n    # Join the extracted julia language code together\n    joined_code = join([c[\"code\"] for c in matches])\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The `r\"```julia\\n(?<code>[\\w\\W]+?)\\n```\"` regular expression is used to find all markdown code fences that start with \"```julia\", have any content (`\\w\\W+`) between them and end with another pair of triple backticks.\n\n2. The `match.(r\"```julia\\n(?<code>[\\w\\W]+?)\\n```\", md)` function call finds all matches in the markdown document `md` using this regular expression. \n\n3. We collect these matches into an array using `collect`. Each match contains a dictionary with the matched content.\n\n4. Finally, we extract the julia language code from each match using `c[\"code\"] for c in matches` and join them together using `join`. This gives us the desired output: all code blocks joined into one string.","status":200,"tokens":[399,356],"elapsed":70.38875175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
