[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can use Julia's built-in `Markdown` module to parse the markdown document and extract all the code blocks. We will then iterate over these code blocks, remove any code fences, join them together with a newline, and return the result as a string.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown document\n    doc = parse(Markdown.MD, md)\n\n    # Extract all code blocks and join them together\n    code_blocks = mapreduce((block) -> join(strip(block)), \"\\n\", filter(isequal(:CodeBlock), doc))\n\n    return code_blocks\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a `String` parameter `md` which represents the markdown document. It uses Julia's built-in `Markdown.parse()` function to parse the provided markdown document and create a `Document` type object. This object contains all the elements of the parsed document, such as headings, paragraphs, and code blocks.\n\nWe then use the `filter()` function to filter out only the code block objects from the parsed document. We check if each element is equal to `:CodeBlock` using the `isequal(:CodeBlock)` predicate. If it matches, we use a `mapreduce()` call with an anonymous function to join all the elements of the code block together as a string by removing any leading or trailing whitespace (`strip(block)`) and then joining them with a newline character (\"\\n\").\n\nFinally, we return the joined code blocks as a single string using `code_blocks` variable.","status":200,"tokens":[399,374],"elapsed":73.8718115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
