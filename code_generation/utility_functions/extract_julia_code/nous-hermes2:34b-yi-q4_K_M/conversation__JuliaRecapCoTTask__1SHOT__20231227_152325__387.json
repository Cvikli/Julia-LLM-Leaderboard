[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

The function iterates through each line of the document, checking if it is within a code block or not. If we are in a code block, we keep joining all lines until we encounter an ending code fence (or reach the end of the document). Once outside the code block, we clean up the code by removing the opening and closing code fences using regular expressions. Finally, we join all cleaned code blocks together to form the final output string.\n\n# Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nThe `extract_julia_code` function correctly extracts Julia code from a markdown document based on its provided structure. It removes any unwanted code fences and joins the code blocks if there are multiple.","status":200,"tokens":[401,543],"elapsed":102.983918292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
