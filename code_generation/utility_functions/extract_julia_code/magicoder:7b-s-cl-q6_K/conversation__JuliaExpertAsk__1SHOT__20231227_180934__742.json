Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function `extract_julia_code` that does what you asked:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all Julia code blocks in the markdown document.\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n\n    # If no Julia code blocks found, return an empty string.\n    if isempty(code_blocks)\n        return \"\"\n    end\n\n    # Concatenate the code blocks and remove surrounding whitespaces.\n    code = join([match[1] for match in code_blocks], \"\\n\") |> s -> replace(s, \"^\\s*\" => \"\") |> s -> replace(s, \"\\s*$\" => \"\")\n    \n    return string(code)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function from Julia's Markdown package to find all code blocks that have \"julia\" as their language. It then joins these blocks together with newline characters and removes leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your markdown document is in UTF-8 format, which is the standard encoding for markdown files. If you use a different encoding (like ASCII), you'll need to convert it to UTF-8 before passing it into the function. Also, this function uses regular expressions to match and extract Julia code blocks from the Markdown document. So if your markdown document has other fenced code blocks, this might not work correctly for those.","status":200,"tokens":[128,349],"elapsed":18.232280209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
