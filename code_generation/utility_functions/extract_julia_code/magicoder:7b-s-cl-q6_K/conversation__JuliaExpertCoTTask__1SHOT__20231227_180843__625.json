[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Find all markdown code blocks\n    blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```(.*?)\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, seed=1))\n    code = join([occurrences[2] for occurrences in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `eachmatch` function to find all substrings that match a regular expression pattern. The pattern is \"```(.*?)\\n(.*?)\\n```\", which matches three strings: 1) the language of the block, 2) the newline character `\\n`, and 3) the actual code content. It uses lazy matching (`?`) to find as few characters as possible before each `\\n`. The `collect` function is used to convert the iterator returned by `eachmatch` into an array.\n\nThe resulting blocks are then joined together with a newline character using the `join` function, and this string is returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[221,231],"elapsed":12.8595015,"_type":"aimessage"}]
