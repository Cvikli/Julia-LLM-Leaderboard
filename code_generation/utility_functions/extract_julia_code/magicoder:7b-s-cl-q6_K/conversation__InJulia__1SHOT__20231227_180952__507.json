[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python function that fulfills the given requirements. It uses the `re` module to handle regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Regular expression pattern for matching code blocks\n    pattern = r'```julia(.+?)```'\n    \n    # Find all matches of the pattern in md\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join with newlines\n    code_blocks = \"\\n\".join([match.strip() for match in matches])\n    \n    return code_blocks\n```\nThis function works by first defining a regular expression pattern that matches the syntax of a Julia code block in markdown (````julia(.+?)````). The `.+?` inside the brackets is a non-greedy match for one or more any characters (but as few as possible), which matches the code within the fences.\n\nThe `re.findall()` function returns all substrings where the pattern matches, and `re.DOTALL` makes it so that `.` also matches newline characters. This allows us to match across multiple lines. \n\nAfter we have our list of matches (which are strings with the code blocks), we remove any code fences by using the `strip()` method, which removes leading/trailing whitespace and newlines.\n\nFinally, we join all of the code blocks together into one string with newline characters in between and return it.","status":200,"tokens":[89,337],"elapsed":17.410985542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
