Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function written in Julia that would achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    blocks = split(md, \"\\n```\")\n    code_blocks = [replace(split(block, '\\n')[2], \"```\" => \"\") for block in blocks if length(split(block)) > 1]\n    return join([join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")]; join=true)\nend\n```\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown document into code blocks using the \"```\" as a delimiter. It then further splits each block into lines and removes the first line (which contains ```), before joining all the remaining lines together. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that there is only one language specified after ```` in the markdown, i.e., the julia code blocks are not mixed with other languages' code blocks. If your document includes multiple types of code block languages, you would need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[128,220],"elapsed":11.699070708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
