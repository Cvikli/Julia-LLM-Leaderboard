It then iterates over each line and checks if it is a Julia code block start (`\"```julia\"`), end (`\" ```\"`) or neither. If it's a start or end, it toggles `in_block` and adds/removes the current block from `code_blocks`. If it's in a block and not an empty line, it appends to the last block (after removing the code fences). Finally, it joins all blocks together with newline characters.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Title\nThis is a markdown document.\nHere's some text.\n\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = x + y\n```\n\nAnd here's more text.\n```\n\"\"\"\nprint(extract_julia_code(md))\n```\nThis would print:\n```julia\nx = 10\ny = 20\nz = x + y\n```","status":200,"tokens":[89,448],"elapsed":23.10600625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
