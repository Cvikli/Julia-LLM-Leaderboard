It then extracts the actual code content from each block, removes any line breaks within the codes, joins them together with a newline, and returns the resulting string containing the joined Julia code blocks without fences.","status":200,"tokens":[96,269],"elapsed":15.9989115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
