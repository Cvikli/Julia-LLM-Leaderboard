[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

I'm ready to help you solve this task using my systematic approach to problem-solving in Julia. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nStep 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets\nI will recall any useful Julia snippets that can help me solve the task more efficiently. These might include functions for working with Markdown files, extracting code blocks, and joining strings together.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task\nUsing the recalled snippets and my understanding of the Julia language, I will write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks from the given Markdown document, removes any code fences, and joins the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nStep 3: Double-Check the Solution\nTo ensure that my solution is correct, I will double-check it by running some test cases using the `julia` interpreter. This will help me catch any potential errors or edge cases that may have been missed during the development of the function.\n\nBased on the given guidelines and Special Instructions, here is the implemented `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Step 1: Extract code blocks\n    code_blocks = [];\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\"); line != \"\"; end\n        push!(code_blocks, line[2:end]); # Remove leading newline and trailing newline\n    \n    # Step 2: Remove code fences\n    code_blocks = [code_block for code_block in code_blocks];\n    \n    # Step 3: Join code blocks together with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\");\nend\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[1,410],"elapsed":14.69186025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
