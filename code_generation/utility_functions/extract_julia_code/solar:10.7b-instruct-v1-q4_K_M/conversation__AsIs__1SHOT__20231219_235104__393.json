Here's an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` to extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n```\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Split the Markdown text into lines\n    lines = md.split(\"\\n\")\n    \n    # Iterate over each line and extract the Julia code block\n    output = []\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith(\"```\"):\n            # Find the end of the code block\n            code_end = line.rfind(\"```\")\n            \n            # Extract the code block text\n            code_text = line[code_end+2:]\n            \n            # Remove the code fences\n            code_text = code_text.replace(\"```\", \"\")\n            \n            # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n            output.append(code_text + \"\\n\")\n        else:\n            output.append(line)\n    return \"\".join(output)\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes a `Markdown` object `md` as input.\n2. It splits the Markdown text into lines using the `split()` method.\n3. It iterates over each line in the Markdown text using a for loop.\n4. For each line, it checks if the line starts with ````. If it does, then it extracts the code block text by finding the end of the code block using the `rfind()` method and then replacing the ```` fences with an empty string.\n5. It joins the extracted code blocks together with a newline using the `join()` method.\n6. The function returns the joined code blocks as a string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the Julia code blocks are contained within backticks (`````) and do not have any other formatting. If your Markdown text has different formatting, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,439],"elapsed":14.304574292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
