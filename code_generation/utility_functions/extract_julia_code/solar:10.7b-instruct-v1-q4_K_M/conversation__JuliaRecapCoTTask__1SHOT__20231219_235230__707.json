[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, thank you for providing me with the task and special instructions! To solve this problem, I will follow my systematic approach to problem-solving:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* `codeblock` function from the `Markdown` package to extract code blocks from Markdown text\n\t* `strip` function to remove fence characters\n\t* `join` function to join multiple code blocks together with a newline\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Use `codeblock` to extract all the code blocks from the input Markdown document\n\t* Remove fence characters using `strip`\n\t* Join the code blocks together with a newline using `join`\n\t* Return the joined code blocks as a String\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the extracted code blocks are valid Julia code\n\t* Ensure that the resulting code block is properly formatted with a newline between each block\n\nImplementation in Julia:\n```julia\nimport Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract all code blocks from Markdown text\n    codeblocks = Markdown.codeblocks(md)\n    \n    # Remove fence characters\n    codeblocks = map(x -> strip(x), codeblocks)\n    \n    # Join code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `Markdown` package is imported to extract the code blocks from the input Markdown document.\n* The `codeblocks` variable is defined to store the extracted code blocks.\n* The `map` function is used to apply the `strip` function to each element of the `codeblocks` list, removing any fence characters.\n* The `join` function is used to join the code blocks together with a newline between each block.\n* The resulting joined code block is stored in the `joined_code` variable and returned at the end of the function.\n\nWith this implementation, you can call the `extract_julia_code` function with a Markdown document as input, and it will return the extracted Julia code blocks joined together with newlines between each block.","status":200,"tokens":[11,511],"elapsed":18.822752042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
