To extract all the Julia code blocks from the given Markdown document `md`, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\nI will recall the following Julia syntax that may be helpful for this task:\n\t* Code fences (````): to enclose Julia code blocks\n\t* Control structures (`if-elseif-else`), `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, and `while`: to handle conditional statements and loops\n\t* Functions (`function f(x) end`): to define custom functions\n\t* Anonymous functions (`x -> x^2`): to create simple anonymous functions\n\t* Arrays (`[1, 2, 3]`): to work with arrays\n\t* Slicing (`a[1:2]`): to extract subarrays\n\t* Tuples `(1, 2)` and namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`: to create tuples and named tuples\n\t* Dictionaries `Dict(\"key\" => value)`: to work with dictionaries\n\t* The `$` symbol for string interpolation: to interpolate strings\n2. Solve the task:\nI will use Julia's standard libraries and avoid creating new packages unless explicitly requested. I will also use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to avoid being too restrictive and prioritize performance, clarity, and abstract types.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nI will double-check my solution by running it on a sample input and verifying that it produces the expected output.\n\nNow, please provide me with the Markdown document `md` containing the Julia code blocks, and I will extract them for you.","status":200,"tokens":[1,382],"elapsed":13.643536833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
