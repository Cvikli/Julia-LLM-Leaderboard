[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In the absence of specific instructions, I will provide a Julia function that fulfills the general task description.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    codeBlocks = search(:\"``` julia\\n.*?`\"\"\"\", md)\n    strippedCodeBlocks = map((x) -> strip(strip(md[x:end-2]), prefix = `\"\"\"), codeBlocks)\n    mergedCodeBlocks = join(strippedCodeBlocks, \"\\n\")\n    return mergedCodeBlocks\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use regular expressions to find the markdown lines enclosed by triple backticks with `julia` between them. We strip unnecessary white spaces on both sides of each block using the `strip()` function and then join all these stripped code blocks with newline characters to return a single string representing the extracted Julia code blocks from the provided markdown document. Keep in mind that this solution assumes no other languages or syntaxes are used within the markdown file. If other languages are used, they need to be handled separately.","status":200,"tokens":[404,236],"elapsed":17.022718917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
