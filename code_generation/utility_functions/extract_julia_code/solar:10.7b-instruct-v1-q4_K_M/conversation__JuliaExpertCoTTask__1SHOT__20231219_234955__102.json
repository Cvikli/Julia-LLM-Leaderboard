[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, let's get started! Here is the function `extract_julia_code` that meets your requirements:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    # Step 1: Extract all code blocks from the markdown document\n    code_blocks = findall(md, r\"``` julia\")\n\n    # Step 2: Remove code fences and join code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce((accumulator, current) -> accumulator * current * \"\\n\", code_blocks)\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nExplanation of the code:\n\n* `function extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String`: Defines the function that takes a markdown document as input and returns a string containing the extracted Julia code.\n* `code_blocks = findall(md, r\"``` julia\")`: Uses the `findall` function to extract all occurrences of the `@code` syntax from the markdown document. The regular expression `r\"``` julia\"` matches any line that starts with a backtick and contains the string \"julia\".\n* `joined_code = reduce((accumulator, current) -> accumulator * current * \"\\n\", code_blocks)`: Uses the `reduce` function to concatenate all the extracted code blocks together, using the `*` operator to combine them and the `\\n` character to insert a newline between each block. The initial value of `accumulator` is set to the empty string, and the final value of `current` is set to the empty string after the last code block has been processed.\n* `return joined_code`: Returns the concatenated string of Julia code blocks.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there are no code fences inside the code blocks (i.e., the code blocks are not nested). If you need to handle nested code fences, you can modify the regular expression `r\"``` julia\"` to match the correct syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[1,453],"elapsed":15.476691667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
