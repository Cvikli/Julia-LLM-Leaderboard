Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

Here is an example of how you could write a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia to extract all the code blocks, remove code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use RegEx to find all code blocks in the Markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r\"``([^{)]*)`\", md)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(filter(x -> x != \"```\", code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```\njulia> md = \"```\nHello World!\n```\nJulia is a programming language that is becoming increasingly popular. It has a lot of useful features and is relatively easy to learn.\n```\njulia> extracted_code = extract_julia_code(md)\n\"Hello World!\\n```\n```\njulia> println(extracted_code)\nHello World!\n```\nNote that this function assumes that the Markdown document is in the same file as the Julia code. If the Markdown document is in a different file, you will need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,303],"elapsed":9.6559505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
