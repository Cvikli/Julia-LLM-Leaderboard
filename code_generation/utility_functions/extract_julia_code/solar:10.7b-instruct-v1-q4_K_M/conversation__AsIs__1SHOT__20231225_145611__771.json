It looks for \"```julia\" in the beginning of a line, meaning it's the start of a Julia code block. Once the start is found, it will collect lines until either the end of the file or \"```\" (representing any kind of code fence) is reached. After collecting all code blocks, it removes empty elements and joins them with newlines to return a single string containing extracted Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[93,372],"elapsed":21.955316291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
