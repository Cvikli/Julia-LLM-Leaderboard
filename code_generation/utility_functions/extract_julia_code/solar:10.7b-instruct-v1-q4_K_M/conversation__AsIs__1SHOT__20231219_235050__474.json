Here's an example of how you could write a function `extract_julia_code` to extract Julia code blocks from a Markdown document:\n```\ndef extract_julia_code(md: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all the Julia code blocks in a Markdown document.\n\n    Args:\n        md (str): The Markdown document containing the Julia code blocks.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A string containing the extracted Julia code blocks, with each block separated by a newline.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use re to find all the code fences in the markdown\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'`([ 0123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_]*)', md)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    return \"\\n\".join(code_blocks[1:])\n```\nHere's how you could use this function to extract the Julia code from a Markdown document:\n```\nmd = \"This is a Markdown document containing some Julia code:\\n```julia\\ndefine foo(x) = x^2 end\"\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\nprint(code)  # Output: ```julia\ndef foo(x) = x^2 end\n```\nI hope this helps!
