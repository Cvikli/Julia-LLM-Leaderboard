Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a possible implementation of a function `extract_julia_code` that meets your requirements:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Split the Markdown into an array of code blocks\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"\") |> Map(wrap) |> Filter(isnotempty)\n\n    # Remove code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = reduce((acc, cur) -> acc * cur.strip() * \"\\n\", [], code_blocks)\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n\nfunction wrap(s::String)\n    return \"```$s\\n\"\nend\n```\nWith this function, you can pass in a Markdown document as a string, and it will return the extracted Julia code blocks, without code fences, joined together with a newline.\n\nNote: The `wrap` function is a simple wrapper around the original Markdown code block, which adds the necessary syntax highlighting to make it look like a Julia code block in the output.","status":200,"tokens":[1,237],"elapsed":7.557176375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
