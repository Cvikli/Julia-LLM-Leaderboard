The regular expression pattern `r\"\\n```julia(?:(\\n[^\\n]+))*\\n```\"` is used to search for all Julia code blocks within multiple lines in the markdown document (using re.MULTILINE and re.DOTALL flags). The function removes fence characters (\"```\") from the matched string, strips whitespaces, and returns the final joined Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[93,318],"elapsed":18.847168875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
