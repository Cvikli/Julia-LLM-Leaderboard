X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Based on the information provided, here are the steps I will follow to extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document `md`:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\nI will recall the following Julia snippets that may be useful for this task:\n\t* `code_block()` function from the `Markdown` package, which can be used to execute a code block in a Markdown file.\n\t* `match()` function, which can be used to perform pattern matching on a string.\n2. Solve the Task:\nI will use the `code_block()` function to extract all the code blocks from the markdown document `md`. Then, I will remove any code fences using the `String.rstrip()` method. Finally, if there are multiple code blocks, I will join them together with a newline using the `join()` function.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nTo double-check that my solution is correct, I will use the `match()` function to check if any code blocks remain after removing the code fences and joining them together. If any code blocks are left over, it means that there are still some code fences remaining in the document, which I will need to remove.\n\nHere's an example of how I will implement the `extract_julia_code()` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use code_block() to extract all code blocks from markdown document\n    code_blocks = code_block(md)\n    \n    # Remove code fences using rstrip()\n    code_blocks = map(x -> x.rstrip(), code_blocks)\n    \n    # Join code blocks together with a newline if there are multiple\n    joined_code_blocks = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code_blocks\nend\n```\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[389,447],"elapsed":19.74281425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
