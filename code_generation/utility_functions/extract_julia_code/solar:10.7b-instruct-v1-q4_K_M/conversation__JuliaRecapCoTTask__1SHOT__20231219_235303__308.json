[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Based on the information provided, here are the steps I will follow to solve the problem:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Functions: `function`, `f`\n\t* Control structures: `if-elseif-else`, `while`, `for`\n\t* Data types: arrays `[a]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`\n\t* Dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`\n\t* String interpolation `$`\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Read the markdown document `md` and extract all code blocks using the function `extract_julia_code`.\n\t* Remove any code fences from the extracted code blocks.\n\t* Join the code blocks together with a newline using the function `join_code_blocks`.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the extracted code blocks are accurate representations of the original markdown document.\n\t* Make sure that the joined code blocks are properly formatted and do not contain any errors.\n\nHere are some additional steps I will take to ensure that my solution meets your requirements:\n\n* If you provide any special instructions, I will prioritize them over the guidelines provided.\n* I will use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to avoid being too restrictive and emphasize performance, clarity, and abstract types whenever possible.\n* I will distinguish between Julia and Python by using 1-based indexing and multiple dispatch.\n* I will not provide any examples, as you requested.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on my approach.","status":200,"tokens":[1,393],"elapsed":14.067110917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
