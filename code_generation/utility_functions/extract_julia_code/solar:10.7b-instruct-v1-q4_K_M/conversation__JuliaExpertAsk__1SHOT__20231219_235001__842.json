Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    code_blocks = findall(md, Markdown.code_block)\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return String(joined_code)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `Markdown.code_block` function from the `Markdown` package to find all the code blocks in the input Markdown document. It then joins the code blocks together with a newline character using the `join` function. Finally, it returns the resulting string as a Julia string.","status":200,"tokens":[118,150],"elapsed":5.522628417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
