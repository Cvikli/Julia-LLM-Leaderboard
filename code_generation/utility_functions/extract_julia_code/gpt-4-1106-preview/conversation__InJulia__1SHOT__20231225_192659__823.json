Here's a function in Julia that does what you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Define a pattern that matches Julia code blocks in Markdown\n    julia_code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\s*\\n(.*?)```\"sm\n\n    # Find all the matches and their captures (the code inside the code blocks)\n    matches = eachmatch(julia_code_block_pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from the captures and join them into a single string with new lines\n    extracted_code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nIn the function `extract_julia_code`, we define a regex pattern `julia_code_block_pattern` to match code blocks that specify Julia syntax with tripe backticks (```) on either side and `julia` written directly after the opening backticks. The `sm` flags in the regex pattern enable \"dotall\" mode, allowing the `.` to match newline characters, and \"multiline\" mode, allowing `^` and `$` to match the start and end of the input string, respectively.\n\nWe then apply the regex to the `md` string with `eachmatch` to get an iterator over all matches found in the markdown. Each match has a `captures` field containing the content of the captured groups (the actual code within the backticks, in this case).\n\nFinally, we extract the code from each match, join them with new lines between blocks, and return the result as a single `String`.","status":200,"tokens":[81,329],"elapsed":11.627031709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
