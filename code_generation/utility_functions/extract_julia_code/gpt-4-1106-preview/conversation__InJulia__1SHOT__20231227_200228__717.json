Here's a Julia function that performs the specified task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Pattern to match Julia code blocks in the markdown document\n    julia_code_fence_pattern = r\"```julia[\\s\\S]+?```\"\n\n    # Collect all matched Julia code blocks\n    code_blocks = matchall(julia_code_fence_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Remove the fences and join the code blocks with a newline\n    joined_code = join([replace(block, r\"^```julia|```$\", \"\") for block in code_blocks], \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to identify the Julia code blocks delimited by \"```julia\" and \"```\". It then removes these fences and joins the resulting code blocks with a newline character. Make sure that the `matchall` function and regular expressions are used according to the Julia version you are using, as there might be differences in function names and support across different Julia versions.","status":200,"tokens":[81,211],"elapsed":18.183970084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
