It extracts the contents of these code blocks, ensuring that the code fences (triple backticks with \"julia\" language identifier) are not included. If there are multiple code blocks, they are joined with a newline character. The function returns the resulting code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[78,218],"elapsed":7.159283708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
