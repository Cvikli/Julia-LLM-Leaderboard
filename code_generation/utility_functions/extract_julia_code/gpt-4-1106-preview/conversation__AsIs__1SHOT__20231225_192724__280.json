Here's how you could implement the `extract_julia_code` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Pattern to match Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Extracts all julia code blocks matches\n    matches = eachmatch(julia_code_block_pattern, md)\n\n    # Collects all the code blocks and strips the leading and trailing code fences\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]\n\n    # Joins the code blocks with a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match the Julia code blocks within the markdown string. It captures the content inside the code blocks, excluding the code fences, and then joins them together separated by a newline character. The returned value is a string that contains the extracted Julia code.","status":200,"tokens":[78,201],"elapsed":16.775231791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
