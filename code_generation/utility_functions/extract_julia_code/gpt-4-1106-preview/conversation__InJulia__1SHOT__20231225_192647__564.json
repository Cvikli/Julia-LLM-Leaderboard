Below is the function `extract_julia_code` in Julia that takes a markdown document string as input and returns the concatenated Julia code blocks as a string.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Define the regex pattern for Julia code blocks\n    code_block_pattern = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Find all Julia code blocks\n    matches = eachmatch(code_block_pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract the code (second capture group of the regex) and join with newlines\n    extracted_code = join([match.captures[1] for match in matches], \"\\n\")\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to locate and extract Julia code blocks. It looks for fences that specify the start and end of code blocks with `julia` language specified, captures the content inside the fences, and joins them using a newline character '\\n'. The `s` after the regular expression pattern is for DOTALL mode, which allows the dot `.` to match newlines, so that multi-line code blocks are matched successfully.","status":200,"tokens":[81,233],"elapsed":12.910080083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
