Here's how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Define start and end delimiters for Julia code blocks in Markdown\n    start_fence = \"```julia\"\n    end_fence = \"```\"\n\n    # Use a buffer to collect the extracted code blocks\n    code_blocks = IOBuffer()\n\n    # Split the document into lines for easier processing\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    is_code_block = false\n\n    # Iterate over the lines\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts a Julia code block\n        if occursin(start_fence, line)\n            is_code_block = true\n            continue  # Skip the start_fence line\n        end\n        # Check if the line ends a Julia code block\n        if occursin(end_fence, line) && is_code_block\n            is_code_block = false\n            write(code_blocks, '\\n')  # Separate code blocks with a newline\n            continue  # Skip the end_fence line\n        end\n        # If we are inside a code block, append the line to the buffer\n        if is_code_block\n            write(code_blocks, line)\n            write(code_blocks, '\\n')  # Add a newline after each line of code\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Convert the buffer contents to a String and return\n    return String(take!(code_blocks))\nend\n```\n\nThis function initializes an `IOBuffer` as a convenient way to build up the final string. It then loops over each line of the markdown content, checks for the start and end of Julia code blocks, and then extracts the code, omitting the fence markers. It outputs all the code blocks, joined by a single newline character to separate them.","status":200,"tokens":[81,405],"elapsed":25.722798709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
