Here is a function in Julia that takes a markdown string as input, extracts all Julia language code blocks, removes the code fences (assuming they are the standard triple-backticks), and joins the code blocks together with newlines.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Define the start and end of a julia code block\n    start_fence = \"```julia\"\n    end_fence = \"```\"\n\n    # Temporarily replace windows line ending with unix style if present\n    md = replace(md, \"\\r\\n\" => \"\\n\")\n\n    # Split the document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty array to hold code without the fences\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    # Flag to check if we are inside a julia code block\n    in_block = false\n\n    # Buffer to store the lines of the current Julia code block\n    current_block = []\n\n    # Iterate through each line\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if we are entering a julia code block\n        if line == start_fence\n            in_block = true\n            continue  # Skip adding the start_fence\n        end\n\n        # Check if we are exiting a julia code block\n        if line == end_fence && in_block\n            in_block = false\n            # Add the accumulated code block to the list\n            push!(code_blocks, join(current_block, '\\n'))\n            current_block = []\n            continue  # Skip adding the end_fence\n        end\n\n        # If we are in a block, add the line to the current_block buffer\n        if in_block\n            push!(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join all the code blocks with a newline and return the resulting string\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the markdown contains correctly formatted code blocks with the \"```julia\" identifier for Julia code blocks and that there are no nested code blocks within a code block. It expects a single markdown string that represents the entire document. The code blocks are joined with double newlines to provide visual separation between individual code blocks when they are printed or viewed.","status":200,"tokens":[81,460],"elapsed":41.173439125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
