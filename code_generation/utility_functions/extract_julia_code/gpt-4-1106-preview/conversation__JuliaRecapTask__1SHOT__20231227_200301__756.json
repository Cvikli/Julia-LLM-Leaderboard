[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Define a function called `extract_julia_code`.\n2. Use a regular expression to match Julia code blocks within the markdown text.\n3. Remove the code block fences specific to Julia, usually indicated by triple backticks followed by \"julia\".\n4. Join all the matched code blocks from the markdown document with a newline.\n5.

The replace function uses this regex to match only the starting fence with \"julia\" and the ending fence, and replaces them with nothing, effectively removing them. The result of the replace function is then joined with a newline to get the final concatenated Julia code as a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[338,330],"elapsed":17.360380125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
