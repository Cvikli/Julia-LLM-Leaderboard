This function takes a Markdown document string as input, searches for Julia code blocks, extracts their content without the code fences, and joins the code blocks with a newline:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Define the regex to match Julia code blocks\n    julia_code_block_regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s\n\n    # Find all matches and extract the code without the fences\n    code_blocks = [m.captures[1] for m in eachmatch(julia_code_block_regex, md)]\n\n    # Join the code blocks separated by a newline\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to match the pattern of Julia code blocks, which are assumed to start with ```julia and end with ```. The `s` flag is used in the regex pattern to allow . (dot) to match newline characters as well, ensuring that multiline code blocks are captured. `eachmatch` is used to find all the matches, and the extracted code (without the fences) is collected in an array. Finally, the `join` function concatenates all the code blocks with a newline separator.","status":200,"tokens":[81,262],"elapsed":15.778229583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
