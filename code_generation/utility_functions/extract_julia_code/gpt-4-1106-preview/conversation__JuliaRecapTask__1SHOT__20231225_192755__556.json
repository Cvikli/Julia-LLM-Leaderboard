[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! To solve the task, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a function `extract_julia_code` that takes a markdown document as input.\n2. Use a regular expression to find all Julia code blocks, which are typically delineated by triple backticks followed by the language identifier `julia`.\n3. Extract the code blocks, excluding the code fences with the `julia` identifier.\n4. Join all extracted code blocks together, separated by a newline.\n5. Return the resulting string of joined code blocks.\n\nHere is the implementation of the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::String\n    julia_code_blocks = matchall(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\"s, md)\n    extracted_code = join(julia_code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    # Removing the code fences and 'julia' identifier\n    stripped_code = replace(extracted_code, r\"```julia\\n\" => \"\")\n    stripped_code = replace(stripped_code, r\"\\n```\" => \"\")\n    return stripped_code\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that I used the non-greedy version of the regular expression `(.*?)` to capture any content between the code fences and the `s` flag to allow the dot `.` to match newline characters. The `matchall` function is used to find all matches of the regex in the document. I then join all matches with a newline and strip away the leading and trailing code fences and language identifiers from the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[338,312],"elapsed":14.416297,"_type":"aimessage"}]
