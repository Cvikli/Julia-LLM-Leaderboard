Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `extract_julia_code` takes a Markdown document as input, and extracts all the code blocks that have Julia language syntax. It then returns the extracted Julia code as a single string with newline separators between individual code blocks.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function using the [CommonMark](https://github.com/jwillstrop/CommonMark.jl) library in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing CommonMark # Import the library.\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    doc = parse_markdown(md) # Parse the markdown document.\n    blocks = [] # Create an empty array to store code blocks.\n    \n    for node in walk(doc, CodeBlock) # Iterate through all code blocks.\n        if startswith(node.info, \"julia\") # Check for Julia language syntax.\n            push!(blocks, node.literal) # Add the block to the array.\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(blocks, '\\n') # Join all code blocks with newline separators.\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first parse the Markdown document using `parse_markdown` from CommonMark. Then, we iterate through all the code blocks in the document and check if their language syntax starts with \"julia\". If it does, we add that block to an array of blocks. Finally, we join the array into a single string, separating each block by a newline character.\n\nThis function should work for any Markdown document containing Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":14.58144984,"_type":"aimessage"}]
