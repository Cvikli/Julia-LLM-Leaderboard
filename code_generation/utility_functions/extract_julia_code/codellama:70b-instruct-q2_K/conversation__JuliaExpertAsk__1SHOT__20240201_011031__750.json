Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I apologize for the confusion earlier. Here is my revised answer to your question:\n\nJulia is a powerful language that allows you to create and run code in a multitude of ways. One way to create Julia code is to write it directly into a markdown document, using special formatting called \"code fences\" around the code.\n\nIf you're provided with a markdown document, `md`, containing Julia code blocks that have been properly formatted with code fences, the function `extract_julia_code` should extract all of the code blocks, remove the code fences, and join them together with newlines, if there are multiple blocks.\n\nThe solution to this problem involves a combination of string manipulation, pattern matching, and regular expressions. The steps would be:\n\n1. Parse the markdown document to identify the Julia code blocks. You can use `split` or `match` functions to extract these blocks.\n2. Remove any formatting elements, such as code fences (````), that are present in the original markdown document. You can use regex replacement with empty strings to remove these elements.\n3. Join the remaining code blocks together with newlines. You can use the `join` function to concatenate each block with a newline character (`\\n`).\n4. Return the extracted and formatted Julia code as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[0,290],"elapsed":11.929900946,"_type":"aimessage"}]
