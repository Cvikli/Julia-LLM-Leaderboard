You have been given two documents, `md1` and `md2`, both in markdown format containing julia language blocks. Each developer has used the same language block but with different numbers of comments (#{RE_JULIA}) at the beginning.\n\nHere are some facts: \n- Developer 1 wrote all of their code in `md1`.\n- Developer 2 wrote half of their code in `md2`, and the rest in `md1`.\n- The total number of julia language blocks is equal for both developers across both documents. \n- The developer who used more comments (#{RE_JULIA}) at the beginning has written more julia blocks than the other one.\n- Developer 1 wrote exactly three times as many julia blocks in `md1` than the other developer did in `md2`.\n\nQuestion: How many julia language blocks did each developer write, and how many comments (#{RE_JULIA}) did they use at the beginning of their code?\n\n\nLet's denote the number of julia blocks written by Developer 1 as 'x' and the number of julia blocks written by Developer 2 as 'y'. Since Developer 1 wrote all of their code in `md1`, we know that x + y = total_blocks.\n\nDeveloper 2 wrote half of their code in `md2` which means they wrote 0.5y julia blocks in `md2`. They also wrote the rest in `md1` so, Developer 2 wrote (0.5y/2)*x julia blocks in `md1`, which simplifies to 0.25xy julia blocks. \n\nSince we know that Developer 1 wrote exactly three times as many julia blocks in `md1` than the other developer did in `md2`, this means x = 3 * (0.5y/2)*x, solving for y gives us y = 6. \n\nSubstitute 'y' into equation from step 2 to find 'x'. We get x + 6 = total_blocks and since we don't know the value of total blocks, we can't solve directly but we do know that Developer 1 wrote more than Developer 2 in both `md1` and `md2`.\n\nFrom step 3, we conclude that y = 6. Therefore, the number of julia blocks written by Developer 1 is 'x' and the number of julia blocks written by Developer 2 is 'y'.\n\nAnswer: The developer wrote '6' julia blocks and used '3*6=18' comments at the beginning of their code in `md1`, while the other developer wrote '0.25*6=1.5' julia blocks and used '18/3=6' comments at the beginning of their code in `md2`.","status":200,"tokens":[83,793],"elapsed":21.318445708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
