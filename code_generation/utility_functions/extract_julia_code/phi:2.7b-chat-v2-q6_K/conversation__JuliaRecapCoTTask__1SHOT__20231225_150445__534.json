[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Do not provide any examples.\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n\n\nThe Assistant receives a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks from a user. The Assistant must extract all the code blocks, remove code fences and join the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. The extracted code will be returned as a string. \n\nLet's represent this task using a tree of thought reasoning:\n\n- Each code block in `md` is a node in our tree.\n- Code fences ('{{', '}}') separate nodes and are ignored.\n- If there are multiple code blocks, they should be joined together with a newline character (`\\n`).\n\nThe Assistant needs to follow these steps:\n1. Iterate over the `md` document line by line.\n2. Use string manipulation methods to extract any code block that is not surrounded by code fences.\n3. If there are multiple code blocks, join them together with a newline character (`\\n`).\n4. Return the resulting string as the final output.\n\nWe will represent each step as an individual function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n# Step 1 - Iterate over the md document line by line and extract code blocks not surrounded by code fences\ncode_blocks = []\n\nfor line in md.split('\\n'):\nif '{{' not in line:# Start of a code block\nblock = ''\n\nwhile '}}' not in line:# Add to the current code block until end of block is reached\nblock += line[line.index('}') + 1:]\nline = line[line.index('{{', max(0, line.rindex('}}') - 2))+2 :]\n\ncode_blocks.append(block)\n\n# Step 2 - Join the code blocks together if there are multiple\nif len(code_blocks) > 1:\nreturn '\\n'.join(code_blocks)\nelse:\nreturn code_blocks[0]# Return a single block if there is only one\n```\n\n\nAnswer: The `extract_julia_code` function will extract all the code blocks, remove code fences and join the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. It returns a string as output.","status":200,"tokens":[372,589],"elapsed":17.348463625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
