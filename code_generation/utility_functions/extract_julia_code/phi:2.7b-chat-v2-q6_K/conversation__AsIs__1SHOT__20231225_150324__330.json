You have been given some julia code blocks from Markdown files which contain different pieces of your research data. The codes consist of numerical values representing the molecular properties, such as mass, charge and energy. \n\nHowever, the codes are not in order, they are scattered all over the markdown file `md`. Your task is to use the `extract_julia_code` function provided above to get a string that contains all the julia code blocks without any code fences. After getting this string, you need to analyze it and find out which code block (a) has the highest energy value, (b) has the lowest charge value, (c) is related with mass greater than 10 Da and (d) does not contain \"#{code}\" which signifies a comment in julia code.\n\nQuestion: What are the properties of each of these four different molecular pieces?\n\n\nThe first step would be to extract all the julia code blocks from the `md` markdown file using the function `extract_julia_code`. \n```\ncode_blocks = extract_julia_code(md)\n```\n\nNext, we need to filter out all the code fences and join the code blocks together with a newline. This will give us a string where each line represents one code block.\n```\nfiltered_code_blocks = join \"\\n\", filtered_code_blocks\n```\nWe can then analyze each code block for its properties. However, as we don't have any specific information about the structure of these codes and their properties, this step would require a bit more creativity. The chemist could consider using different methods like:\n- Reading each line (or piece of data) from the string, stripping away unnecessary characters or spaces and converting to an appropriate numeric type where possible. This will give us numerical values representing the molecular properties.\n- For cases where we have multiple pieces of data in a single line, we can split the line based on space characters, then process each piece accordingly.\n- Depending on the specific information provided with these codes, it might be possible to make some assumptions or use other computational chemistry tools for analysis like RDKit or PyMOL. \nAfter processing all the code blocks and their corresponding properties, we can answer the question based on our findings.\nAnswer: The properties of each of these four different molecular pieces will depend entirely on what the actual julia codes contain in the `md` markdown file.","status":200,"tokens":[80,637],"elapsed":16.73478375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
