[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a possible function definition in Julia that accomplishes this task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Use regular expressions to extract code blocks\n    code_blocks = eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    # Loop through each code block\n    for cb in code_blocks\n        # Remove the code fences and append the code block to the extracted code\n        extracted_code *= replace(cb.match, r\"^```julia|```$\" => \"\")\n        # Add a newline between code blocks (except for the first one)\n        extracted_code *= \"\\n\" if !isempty(extracted_code)\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a string\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\nHere's a brief explanation of how the function works:\n\n* The function takes a string `md` as input, which contains the markdown document with Julia code blocks.\n* It uses regular expressions to extract all the code blocks from the document. Specifically, it looks for text that is enclosed between triple backticks (```) followed by the word \"julia\" (which indicates a Julia code block).\n* For each code block, it removes the leading and trailing triple backticks (which are the code fences) using the `replace` function.\n* It appends the cleaned code block to a running string `extracted_code`.\n* Between code blocks, it adds a newline character to ensure that the code blocks are separated from each other in the final output.\n* Finally, it returns the `extracted_code` string containing all the Julia code blocks, joined together with newlines.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input `md` string contains valid markdown syntax with Julia code blocks. If the input is not well-formed, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[86,451],"elapsed":6.05320725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
