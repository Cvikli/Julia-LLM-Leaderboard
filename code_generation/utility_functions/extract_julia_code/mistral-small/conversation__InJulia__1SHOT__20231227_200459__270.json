If a line starts with \"```julia\", it indicates the beginning of a code block, so we add any existing code to the `code_blocks` array and reset the `current_block` variable to a new `IOBuffer`. If a line ends with \"```\", it indicates the end of a code block, so we add the `current_block` to the `code_blocks` array and reset it again. In between, any lines that are part of an open code block are written to the `current_block` variable.\n\nFinally, the function returns the concatenation of all the code blocks, separated by newlines. If the markdown document doesn't contain any code blocks, the function returns an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[89,444],"elapsed":5.988897042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
