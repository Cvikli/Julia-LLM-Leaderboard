It then removes the starting and ending fences from each code block and concatenates them together into a single string, with a newline character between each code block.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```\nmd = \"\"\"\n    Here is some markdown document with Julia code blocks:\n\n    ```julia\n    x = 1\n    y = 2\n    z = x + y\n    ```\n\n    And here is some more markdown with another Julia code block:\n\n    ```julia\n    println(\"The sum of x and y is: \", z)\n    ```\n\"\"\"\n\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(code)\n```\nThis will output:\n```\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = x + y\n\nprintln(\"The sum of x and y is: \", z)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[89,449],"elapsed":6.023617833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
