We use the `eachmatch` function with a regular expression to match Julia code blocks in the input markdown string. The regular expression matches blocks that start and end with three backticks and the word \"julia\" on a line by itself (with optional whitespace).\n2. We initialize an empty `IOBuffer` to store the extracted code.\n3. We loop through each code block and remove the leading and trailing code fence characters using string slicing.\n4. We write the code block to the output `IOBuffer` using the `write` function.\n5. We add a newline between code blocks to separate them.\n6. Finally, we convert the `IOBuffer` to a string and return it, removing the trailing newline character with string slicing.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown string is well-formed and contains at least one Julia code block. If there's a chance that the input might not meet these criteria, you may want to add error handling code to the function.","status":200,"tokens":[86,463],"elapsed":6.195487583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
