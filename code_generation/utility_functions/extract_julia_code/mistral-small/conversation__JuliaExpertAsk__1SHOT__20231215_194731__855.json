Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # In case the markdown document ends with a code block\n    if !isempty(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown document. If it encounters the start of a code block (```julia), it sets a flag to indicate that it is inside a code block. While inside a code block, it writes each line to an `IOBuffer`. When it encounters the end of a code block (```), it adds the contents of the `IOBuffer` to a list of code blocks and resets the `IOBuffer`. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[130,372],"elapsed":4.892239375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
