Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            empty!(current_block)\n            continue\n        elseif in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add any remaining code in the final block\n    if !isempty(current_block)\n        push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown document, checking if we are currently in a code block (indicated by the presence of triple backticks followed by `julia`). If we are, it writes the line to an `IOBuffer` to accumulate the code. When it encounters the end of a code block, it adds the contents of the buffer to a list of code blocks, and clears the buffer. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[130,356],"elapsed":4.8868125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
