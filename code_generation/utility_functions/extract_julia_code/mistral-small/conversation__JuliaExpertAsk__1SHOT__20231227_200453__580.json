Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that does what you asked:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if isempty(code_blocks)\n                takebuf_string(current_block)\n            end\n            pushfirst!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            empty!(current_block)\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && endswith(line, \"julia\")\n            takebuf_string!(current_block, line)\n            pushfirst!(code_blocks, take!(current_block))\n            empty!(current_block)\n        else\n            takebuf_string!(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, '\\n')\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown document and checking if it starts with triple backticks followed by the string \"julia\". If it does, the function captures the current content of the code block (if there is any) and adds it to a vector of code blocks. Then, the function resets the code block buffer and continues iterating over the lines. If the line does not start with the code fence but is part of the current code block, the function adds it to the buffer. Finally, the function returns a string with all the code blocks joined with a newline character.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks are properly formatted and that there are no unmatched code fences. If that's not the case, the function may not work as expected and may produce incorrect output or throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[130,409],"elapsed":5.625608709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
