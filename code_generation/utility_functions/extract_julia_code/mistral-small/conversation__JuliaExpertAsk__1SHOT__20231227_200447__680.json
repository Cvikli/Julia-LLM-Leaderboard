Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    in_code_block = false\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            in_code_block = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block\n            in_code_block = false\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each line in the input markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with ```julia, it sets the `in_code_block` flag to true and continues to the next line. If it encounters a line that starts with ``` (but not ```julia), it sets the `in_code_block` flag to false, adds the contents of the `current_block` buffer to the `code_blocks` array, and resets the `current_block` buffer. If it is inside a code block, it writes the line to the `current_block` buffer. Finally, it returns a string with all the code blocks joined together with a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[130,354],"elapsed":4.915989875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
