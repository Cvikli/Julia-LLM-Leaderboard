It removes any leading or trailing newlines from each code block, and then joins them together with a newline separator.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\nSome markdown text with a code block:\n\n```julia\nx = 1\ny = 2\n```\n\nAnd some more text with another code block:\n\n```julia\nz = x + y\nprintln(z)\n```\n\"\"\"\n\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\nprintln(code)\n```\nOutput:\n```julia\nx = 1\ny = 2\n\nz = x + y\nprintln(z)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[86,527],"elapsed":7.072553167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
