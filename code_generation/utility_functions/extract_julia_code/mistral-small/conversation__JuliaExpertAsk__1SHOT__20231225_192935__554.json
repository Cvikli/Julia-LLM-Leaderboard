Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    code_blocks = []\n    current_block = IOBuffer()\n\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            if isopen(current_block)\n                push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n            end\n            current_block = IOBuffer()\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            close(current_block)\n            push!(code_blocks, String(take!(current_block)))\n        else\n            write(current_block, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown document as a string and returns a string containing all the Julia code blocks in the document, with newlines between each block. It does this by iterating over each line in the document and checking if it starts with three backticks followed by the word \"julia\". If it does, the function assumes that a new code block is starting. If the code block is already open (i.e. there is already code in the `current_block` buffer), the function saves the current code block and starts a new one. If the line does not start with three backticks followed by \"julia\", the function assumes that it is part of the current code block and writes it to the `current_block` buffer.\n\nIf the line ends with three backticks and starts with \"julia\", the function assumes that the current code block has ended, and saves it to the `code_blocks` array. Finally, the function returns a string containing all the code blocks in the `code_blocks` array, separated by newlines.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the code blocks in the markdown document are properly formatted, and will not handle cases where the formatting is incorrect.","status":200,"tokens":[130,463],"elapsed":6.206941167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
