Return a String.\n\nData: A Markdown document with Julia language code blocks (`md`).\n\nHere's my attempt at solving it: ðŸ¤”\n\n```julia-repl\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract all the code blocks using a regular expression\n    regex = r\"```julia\\n(.*?)```\"ms\n    codeblocks = matchall(regex, md)\n    \n    if length(codeblocks) > 0\n        # Remove code fences and join with newlines\n        output = replace.(codeblocks, \"```\"=>\"\")\n        output_str = join(output, \"\\n\")\n        \n        return output_str\n    else\n        error(\"No Julia code blocks found in the Markdown document!\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this function assumes all code blocks are correctly formatted and marked with ```julia. If a different language is used (e.g., ```python), it will not be extracted. Also, if there are no Julia code blocks in the Markdown document, an error will be thrown. ðŸš¨\n\nLet me know if you need any further clarification or if I can improve my answer in any way! ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[236,372],"elapsed":61.883994333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
