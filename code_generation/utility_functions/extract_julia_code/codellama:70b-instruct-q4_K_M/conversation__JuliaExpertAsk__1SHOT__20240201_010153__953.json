Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This is how I would approach this problem:\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* The markdown document only contains julia language code blocks.\n* There are no other types of code blocks in the markdown file.\n* The code fences used for Julia language blocks begin and end with ```julia\n* All code blocks are separated by at least one newline character.\n\n**Approach:**\n\n1. Split the document into lines using the newline character as a delimiter.\n2. Iterate through each line, looking for the start of a Julia language block (i.e., the ```julia line).\n3. When a Julia language block is found, append all subsequent lines to a String until the end of the code block (i.e., the ``` line) is reached.\n4. Remove the leading and trailing code fences from each code block String.\n5. Concatenate all the extracted code blocks into a single String, separated by newline characters.\n6. Return the resulting concatenated String.\n\n**Function:**\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Split the document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize a variable to hold extracted code blocks\n    julia_code_blocks = \"\"\n\n    in_code_block = false  # Keep track of whether we're inside a Julia language block or not\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")  # Start of a Julia code block\n            in_code_block = true\n        elseif endswith(line, \"```\") && in_code_block  # End of a Julia code block\n            in_code_block = false\n        end\n\n        if in_code_block  # Inside a Julia code block\n            julia_code_blocks *= line * \"\\n\"  # Append the current line to the extracted code blocks String\n        end\n    end\n\n    return strip(julia_code_blocks)  # Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the extracted code blocks String\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the markdown document into lines, then iterates through each line looking for Julia language code blocks. When a Julia language block is found, it appends all subsequent lines to a String until the end of the code block is reached. Finally, it returns the concatenated extracted code blocks String with leading and trailing whitespace removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,552],"elapsed":30.161513547,"_type":"aimessage"}]
