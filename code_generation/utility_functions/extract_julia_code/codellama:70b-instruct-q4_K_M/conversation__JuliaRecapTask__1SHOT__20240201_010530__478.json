[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of `extract_julia_code` as described in the task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code = \"\"\n    is_inside_fence = false\n    \n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        # Check if we're starting or ending a code fence.\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || endswith(line, \"```\")\n            is_inside_fence = !is_inside_fence\n            \n            # If we've just finished processing a block of code, add a newline to the output string.\n            if !is_inside_fence && !isempty(code)\n                code *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n        elseif is_inside_fence\n            # Add each line of code to our output string.\n            code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function iterates through the lines in the markdown document, looking for `julia` language code blocks. When it finds a ```` block, it sets a flag indicating that it's inside a code fence. It then continues to concatenate each line of code until it finds another ```` block, at which point it unsets the flag and adds a newline to the output string.\n\nNote: The function assumes that the input `md` string is well-formatted with properly nested code blocks. If you need to handle malformed inputs, additional error checking may be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":19.150579078,"_type":"aimessage"}]
