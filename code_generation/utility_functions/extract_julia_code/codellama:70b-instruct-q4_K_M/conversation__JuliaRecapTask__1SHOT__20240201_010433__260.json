[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n \t- Markdown parsing libraries like `CommonMark` or `Pandoc`\n 2. Solve the Task:\n \t- Split the markdown document into individual code blocks with a regular expression pattern matching triple backticks (the code fence) and any number of non-backtick characters in between them. This will give us an array of raw code block strings, each containing both the code fences and the actual Julia code within them.\n \t- Iterate through this array and remove the leading and trailing triple backticks (the code fence) from each string using a regular expression pattern matching three backtick characters at either end of the string. This will leave us with an array of raw Julia code strings.\n \t- Join all the remaining Julia code strings together into one large string, separating them by newlines.\n 3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n \t- Test the function on a sample markdown document to make sure it correctly extracts and concatenates all the Julia code blocks as expected.\n\nHere's an example implementation of `extract_julia_code` in Julia language:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract raw code blocks from markdown document\n    code_blocks = matchall(r\"```\\n((?:(?!```).)*)```\", md, overlap=false)\n    \n    # Remove code fences (triple backticks) from each block and join together\n    return join([replace(c, r\"^```|```$\" => \"\") for c in code_blocks], '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function extracts all the Julia code blocks from a markdown document and concatenates them into one large string separated by newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":22.529163247,"_type":"aimessage"}]
