[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n    - `split(str, \"pattern\")` splits a string by pattern and returns an array of substrings.\n    - `replace(str, r\"pattern\" => \"\")` removes a pattern from a string.\n    - `join([elements], \"\\n\")` joins elements with newline character.\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia-repl\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract code blocks from markdown document\n    code_blocks = split(md, \"```julia\")[2:end]  # Split by ```julia and skip the first part (non-code block text)\n    code_blocks = [replace(x, r\"```\" => \"\") for x in code_blocks]  # Remove closing fences (```)\n    code_blocks = [replace(x, \"\\n\\n\" => \"\\n\") for x in code_blocks]  # Remove excess newlines\n    \n    # Join all the code blocks together with newline characters\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n3.
