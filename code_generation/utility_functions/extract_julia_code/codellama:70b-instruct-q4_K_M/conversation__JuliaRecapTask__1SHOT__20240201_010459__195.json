[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Julia language provides a markdown parsing package called `Markdown`. You can use this package to parse the input document and extract code blocks from it. Here is an example of how you can implement the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)::String\n    parsed = Markdown.parse(md)  # Parse the markdown document\n\n    # Filter out only code blocks and join them with newlines\n    return join([b.language == \"julia\" ? b.code : \"\" for b in parsed.content], '\\n')\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the markdown document using `Markdown.parse` to get a list of blocks. Then, it filters out only code blocks (`Markdown.Code`) with Julia language (`b.language == \"julia\"`). For each code block, it extracts the code (`b.code`). If a block is not a code block or has a different language, an empty string is returned instead. Finally, all extracted codes are joined together with newlines using `join`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":13.244976919,"_type":"aimessage"}]
