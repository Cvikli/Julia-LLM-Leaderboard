[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Create a new file called `code_extractor.jl` and open it in your preferred editor (e.g., VS Code or Atom).\n 2. Start by writing the function definition for `extract_julia_code`. It should take one argument, `md`, which represents the markdown document to extract code from. The function will return a String containing all the extracted Julia code.\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract Julia code blocks from 'md' and join them together with newlines\nend\n```\n 3. To identify Julia code blocks, we need to look for lines starting with triple backticks (````). These indicate the start and end of a code block in markdown. To extract the code blocks, we can use regular expressions (regex) to match these lines and capture the text between them. We can use the regex pattern `r\"^```julia$(.*?)^```$\"ism` for this purpose.\n 4. To search through the input string using regex, we can use the `matchall` function in Julia's standard library: `matches = matchall(r\"^```julia$(.*?)^```$\"ism, md)`. This will return a list of all matching code blocks.\n 5. Now, we need to remove the code fences (````) from each matched code block. We can use the `replace` function for this: `clean_matches = replace.(matches, r\"^```julia$\" => \"\")`. This will replace the start of each match with an empty string, effectively removing the backticks.\n 6. To join all the cleaned code blocks together with newlines, we can use the `join` function: `return join(clean_matches, '\\n')`.\n 7. Putting it all together, here is a complete implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Extract Julia code blocks from 'md' and join them together with newlines\n    matches = matchall(r\"^```julia$(.*?)^```$\"ism, md)\n    clean_matches = replace.(matches, r\"^```julia$\" => \"\")\n    return join(clean_matches, '\\n')\nend\n```\n 8. You can now use this function to extract Julia code from markdown documents. Simply call `extract_julia_code` with the markdown document as an argument. The returned String will contain all the extracted Julia code blocks joined together with newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,578],"elapsed":31.538583794,"_type":"aimessage"}]
