The function also removes the code fences surrounding each code block, and joins multiple code blocks together with newline characters if there are any. Here is how it works:\n```julia-repl\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    # Split markdown document into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Boolean flag to indicate if we are inside a Julia code block\n    in_julia_block = false\n\n    # Iterate through each line of the markdown document\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the current line is the start or end of a Julia code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || endswith(line, \"```\")\n            # Toggle the in_julia_block flag\n            in_julia_block = !in_julia_block\n        elseif in_julia_block\n            # We are inside a Julia code block, append the current line to the extracted code string\n            code *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function simply iterates through each line of the markdown document and checks if it is the start or end of a Julia code block (indicated by ```julia at the beginning or end). When inside a Julia code block, it appends the lines to the extracted code string. The return value contains all the Julia code from the markdown document with the code fences removed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":20.319882737,"_type":"aimessage"}]
