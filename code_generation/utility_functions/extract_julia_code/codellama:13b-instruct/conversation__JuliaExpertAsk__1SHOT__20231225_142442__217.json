Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if line.startswith(\"```julia\") || line.endswith(\"```\")\n            continue\n        end\n        code_blocks.push(line.strip())\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string `md` into lines using the `\\n` delimiter, and then iterates over each line to check if it starts with a code fence (```julia`) or ends with a code fence (````). If the line is not a code block, we push it to an array of code blocks. Finally, we join all the code blocks together using the `\\n` delimiter and return the resulting string.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input `md` is a valid Markdown document with Julia code blocks. If the input contains any syntax errors or unclosed code fences, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[135,260],"elapsed":14.88066775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
