Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for block in split(md, \"```\")\n        if length(block) > 2\n            push!(code_blocks, strip(join(split(block[2:end-1], \"\\n\"), \"\")))\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* We first split the input string `md` into individual code blocks using `split(md, \"```\")` which returns an array of strings.\n* We then loop through each block and check if its length is greater than 2 (this excludes empty blocks). If it is, we push the stripped block to a new array `code_blocks` using `push!(code_blocks, strip(join(split(block[2:end-1], \"\\n\"), \"\")))`.\n* Finally, we join the code blocks together with newlines using `join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")` and return the result as a String.","status":200,"tokens":[229,253],"elapsed":25.201579334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
