[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution to the task:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown document into an array of lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the extracted code\n    code = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each line in the markdown document\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a Julia code block\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") || startswith(line, \"```\")\n            # If it's a code block, remove the code fences and append the code to the output string\n            code *= replace(line, r\"[`]{3}(?P<code>[\\s\\S]+)[`]{3}\", s\"\\g<code>\") * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the extracted code as a String\n    return code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to match and replace the code fences in each line of the markdown document. The `startswith` function is used to check if a line starts with the expected code block pattern, and the `replace` function is used to remove the code fences and append the extracted code to the output string. Finally, the function returns the extracted code as a String.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that there are no nested code blocks in the markdown document. If you need to handle nested code blocks, you may want to modify the regular expression pattern or use a different approach altogether.","status":200,"tokens":[397,344],"elapsed":22.230151459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
