If it is, it skips the line and moves on to the next one. Otherwise, it adds the line to an array of extracted code blocks, using the `push!` function. Finally, it joins the extracted code blocks together with a newline and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[97,423],"elapsed":23.314996584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
