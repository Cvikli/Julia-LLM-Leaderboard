Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nextract_julia_code(\"\"\"```julia\nprintln(\"hello world\")\n```\"\"\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one possible implementation of the `extract_julia_code` function:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    code_blocks = []\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\")\n            code_block = \"\"\n            while !startswith(line, \"```\")\n                code_block *= line * \"\\n\"\n                line = next(md)\n            end\n            push!(code_blocks, code_block)\n        end\n    end\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `split` function to split the input markdown string into individual lines, and then loops through each line using a `for` loop. If a line starts with `\"```julia\"`, it adds that line and all subsequent lines until the end of the code block (denoted by `\"```\"`) to a list called `code_blocks`. Finally, it joins the contents of all the code blocks together with a newline character using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each code block is separated from the others by an empty line. If there are multiple code blocks in a row without any empty lines between them, this implementation will not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[185,296],"elapsed":27.146578917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
