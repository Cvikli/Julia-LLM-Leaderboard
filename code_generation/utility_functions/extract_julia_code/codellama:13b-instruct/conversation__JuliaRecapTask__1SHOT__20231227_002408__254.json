[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible solution to the problem:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)::String\n    # Find all code blocks in the markdown document\n    codeblocks = findall(r\"^\\s*```\\w*\"m, md)\n\n    # Extract the code from each code block and join them together with newlines\n    code = mapreduce(c -> replace(c, r\"^\\s*```\\w*\" => \"\"), *, codeblocks)\n\n    return code\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. `findall` is used to find all instances of the regex pattern `^\\s*```\\w*` in the markdown document, which matches a code block fence followed by any number of whitespace characters and any alphanumeric character (i.e., the language specified after the fence). This gives us an array of `String`s containing the code blocks.\n2. We use `mapreduce` to apply the function `c -> replace(c, r\"^\\s*```\\w*\" => \"\")` to each element of the array of code blocks. The function simply replaces the code fence and any whitespace characters before it with an empty string, leaving only the code.\n3. Finally, we use `*` to concatenate all the resulting strings into a single string, which is returned as the final result of the function.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the code blocks in the markdown document are separated by a newline character. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the regex pattern or use a different method for extracting the code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[397,358],"elapsed":23.126596542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
