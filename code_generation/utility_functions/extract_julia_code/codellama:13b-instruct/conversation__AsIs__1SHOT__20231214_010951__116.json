Here is an example of how you could write a function `extract_julia_code` to extract all the Julia code blocks from a Markdown document, remove code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline:\n```\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Use a regular expression to find all code blocks in the Markdown document\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'`([{}])`, md)\n    \n    # Remove code fences by replacing them with an empty string\n    code_blocks = [code_block.replace(\"`\", \"\") for code_block in code_blocks]\n    \n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n    \n    return joined_code\n```\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```\n# Load the Markdown document\nmd = open(\"document.md\", \"r\")\n\n# Extract the Julia code blocks\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\n\n# Print the extracted code blocks\nprint(code)\n```\nThis should output all the Julia code blocks found in the Markdown document, without any code fences and with each block separated by a newline. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[72,297],"elapsed":37.784548708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
