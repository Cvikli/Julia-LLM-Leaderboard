[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution to the task:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    codeblocks = []\n    for block in eachmatch(r\"```julia(.*?)```\", md)\n        codeblock = block.captures[1]\n        codeblock = replace(codeblock, r\"\\n\" => \"\") # remove newline characters\n        codeblock = replace(codeblock, r\"```\" => \"\") # remove code fences\n        push!(codeblocks, codeblock)\n    end\n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nThis function first uses the `eachmatch` function from the `Markdown` package to find all code blocks in the markdown document. It then iterates over each block and uses regular expressions to remove the code fences and newline characters. Finally, it joins all the code blocks together with a newline character using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that all code blocks are Julia code blocks, and will not work if there are other code blocks in the markdown document. If you need to extract code blocks of different types, you can modify the regular expression used by `eachmatch`.","status":200,"tokens":[400,269],"elapsed":18.038356084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
