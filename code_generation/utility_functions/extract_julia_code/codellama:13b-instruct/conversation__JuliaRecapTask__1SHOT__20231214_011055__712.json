[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Based on the information provided, here are the steps I will follow to extract the Julia code blocks from the markdown document:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\nI will review the Julia language syntax and key constructs to ensure I am familiar with the language features and can handle the task efficiently.\n2. Solve the Task:\nI will read the given markdown document, identify all the Julia code blocks, remove the code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nOnce I have extracted the code blocks and joined them together, I will double-check the solution to ensure it is correct and matches the original markdown document.\n\nHere are some key Julia language constructs that may be useful for this task:\n\n* Variables: `x = 10`\n* Control structures: `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`\n* Functions: `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`\n* Arrays: `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`\n* Dictionaries: `Dict(\"key\" => value)`\n* String interpolation: `$`\n\nI will prioritize the provided guidelines and avoid using new packages unless explicitly requested. I will also use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to be flexible and not too restrictive. Reserved names such as `begin`, `end`, and `function` are distinguished from Python, and multiple dispatch is a feature of Julia.\n\nPlease provide the markdown document, and I will extract the Julia code blocks and return the joined code as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[389,404],"elapsed":64.153415875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
