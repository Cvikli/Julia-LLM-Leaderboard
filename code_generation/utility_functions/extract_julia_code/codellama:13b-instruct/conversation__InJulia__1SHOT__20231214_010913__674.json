Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is an example implementation of a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use the `Markdown` package to parse the Markdown document\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n    \n    # Extract all code blocks\n    code_blocks = findall(doc, RegEx(\"```([^]]+)`\"))\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(map(x -> x.value[2:end], code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* `Markdown.parse(md)` parses the Markdown document `md` using the `Markdown` package. This returns a `Document` object, which represents the document as a tree structure.\n* `findall(doc, RegEx(\"```([^]]+)`\"))` uses the `findall` function from the `Base` module to find all occurrences of code blocks in the document. The regular expression `\"```([^]]+)`\"` matches any sequence of characters that starts with an unescaped ``` character and ends with any character other than a backslash or a right-to-left angle bracket (`\"`. The `]` is a capture group, which captures the code that is inside the code block.\n* `map(x -> x.value[2:end], code_blocks)` maps over the code blocks found in the document, and for each code block, it extracts the code that is inside the fence by indexing into the `value` field of the `CodeBlock` object with a slice from the second character to the end of the block.\n* `join(map(x -> x.value, code_blocks), \"\\n\")` joins all the extracted code blocks together with a newline character (`\"\\n\"`). The `map` function is applied to each code block in turn, and the resulting list of code blocks is joined together using the `join` function.\n* Finally, the function returns the joined code blocks as a string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that there are no nested code blocks, and that all code blocks are separated by at least one blank line. If your Markdown document contains nested code blocks or other formatting issues, you may need to modify the regular expression or the `join` function to handle these cases correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[89,548],"elapsed":67.725057625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
