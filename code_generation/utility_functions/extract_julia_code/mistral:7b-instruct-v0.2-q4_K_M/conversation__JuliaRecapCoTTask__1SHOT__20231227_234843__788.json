[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Reading markdown files with Julia using `MdFiles` package or built-in functions from `Markdown` and `FileIO`.\n   - Parsing markdown to find code blocks using regular expressions.\n   - Removing code fences using string manipulation.\n   - Joining multiple code blocks together with a newline using string concatenation.\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nusing MdFiles, Markdown, FileIO, Regex\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    filepath = md * \".md\"\n    content = read(FileIO.open(filepath), String)\n    parsed_content = MD.parse(content)\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    for node in parsed_content.children\n        if isa(node, MdNode{:fence}) && node.info.attributes[:lang] == \"julia\"\n            push!(code_blocks, node.value[2:end])\n        end\n    end\n\n    julia_code = \"\"\n    for codeblock in code_blocks\n        julia_code *= join(split(codeblock, \"\\n\"), \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    return julia_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Verify that the function correctly extracts the code blocks and removes code fences.\n   - Ensure that multiple code blocks are joined together with a newline.\n   - Test the function on various markdown documents containing julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[395,393],"elapsed":17.929176167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
