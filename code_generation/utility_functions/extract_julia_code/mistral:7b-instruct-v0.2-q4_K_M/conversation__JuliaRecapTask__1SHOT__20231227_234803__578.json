X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions (for extracting code blocks)\n   - String manipulation functions (for joining extracted code blocks together and removing code fences)\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n  # Define regular expression pattern for Julia code blocks\n  pattern = r\"^```{3,}(\\s*julia\\s*)?([\\s\\S]+?)^```\"\n\n  # Extract all matches using regex\n  matches = matchall(pattern, md)\n\n  # Initialize an empty list to store extracted code blocks\n  code_blocks = []\n\n  # Iterate through each match and extract the code block\n  for m in matches\n    if isnothing(m.captures[2])\n      push!(code_blocks, m.match)\n    else\n      push!(code_blocks, m.captures[3])\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Join the extracted code blocks with a newline and return as a string\n  String(join(code_blocks, \"\\n\"))\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Verify that the function correctly extracts single-line Julia code blocks without any prefix or suffix.\n   - Check if the function handles multi-line Julia code blocks with a \"julia\" prefix.\n   - Ensure that the extracted code blocks are joined together with newlines as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[393,380],"elapsed":17.390959959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
