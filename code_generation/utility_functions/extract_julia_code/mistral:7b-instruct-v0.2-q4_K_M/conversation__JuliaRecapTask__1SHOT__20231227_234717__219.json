[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the special instructions provided, here's a systematic approach to solving it using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Regular expressions for extracting code blocks\n   - String manipulation functions for joining and formatting the extracted code\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expression pattern for extracting code blocks\n    pattern = r\"^```(\\S+)\\s*(.*?)\\n(```\\1\\s*)$\"\n\n    # Extract all matches of the regular expression from the markdown string\n    matches = match(pattern, md)\n\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the extracted code blocks\n    code_blocks = []\n\n    # Iterate through each match and extract the corresponding code block\n    for m in matches\n        code_block = String(m[2])\n        push!(code_blocks, code_block)\n    end\n\n    # Join all extracted code blocks with a newline character and return as a single string\n    return join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - The regular expression pattern used to extract code blocks should match Julia code fences correctly (i.e., triple backticks followed by a language name and ending with triple backticks)\n   - The extracted code blocks are stored in a vector and joined with newline characters before being returned as a single string.\n\nNote that this function assumes the markdown string is passed as a single argument named `md`. The function also uses the regular expression syntax provided by Julia, which may vary slightly from other programming languages or text editors.","status":200,"tokens":[393,395],"elapsed":18.022302375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
