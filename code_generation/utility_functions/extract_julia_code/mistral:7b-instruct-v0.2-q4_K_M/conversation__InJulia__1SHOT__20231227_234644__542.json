The function processes each node in the parsed markdown tree, checking if it's a Julia code block and appending its content to the codes array. Finally, it joins all the code blocks with newlines and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[87,303],"elapsed":12.194735375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
