[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - `r\"(``{3,}([^]|.*?(`|``))*(\\n|$)([ \\t]*|\\Z)\"` for regular expression pattern matching code blocks\n   - String manipulation functions like `replace`, `split`, and concatenation with `*` or `join`\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    regex = r\"(``{3,}([^]|.*?(`|``))*(\\n|$)([ \\t]*|\\Z)\"\n    matches = matchall(regex, md)\n    code_blocks = [m.match for m in matches]\n    extracted_code = \"\"\n\n    for block in code_blocks\n        lines = split(block.match, \"\\n\")\n        extracted_code *= join(lines, \"\\n\") * \"\\n\"\n    end\n\n    return extracted_code\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Check if `extract_julia_code` function correctly extracts all code blocks and removes code fences while joining them with newlines.\n   - Test it on various markdown documents containing Julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[395,321],"elapsed":14.984578333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
