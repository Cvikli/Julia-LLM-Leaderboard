X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions to extract code blocks.\n\n2.

Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - The function `extract_julia_code` should correctly extract all Julia code blocks from a given markdown string and join them together with newlines.\n   - It's essential to test this function with various edge cases and different markdown inputs to ensure its robustness and accuracy.","status":200,"tokens":[395,260],"elapsed":12.511747875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
