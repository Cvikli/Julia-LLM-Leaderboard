[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks.

It searches for all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown that are written in Julia language (either \"julia\" or \"julia-repl\"). For each match, it removes the code fences and then joins these blocks together with a newline character. If no matching code blocks were found, an empty string is returned.\n\nThis function can be called with a markdown string as follows:\n```julia\nmd = \"```julia\\n1 + 1\\n``` \\n```python\\n2 + 2\\n```\"\nprintln(extract_julia_code(md)) # Prints \"1 + 1\\n\\n\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[392,410],"elapsed":14.460077,"_type":"aimessage"}]
