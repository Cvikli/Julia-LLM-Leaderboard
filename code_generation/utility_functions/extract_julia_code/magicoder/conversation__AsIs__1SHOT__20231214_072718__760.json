Here is an example of how you could write a function `extract_julia_code` to extract all the Julia code blocks from a Markdown document, remove code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline:\n```\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Use a regular expression to find all code blocks in the Markdown\n    code_blocks = re.findall(r'`([^`]*)`, md)\n\n    # Remove code fences from each code block\n    code_blocks = [re.sub(r'``, \"\", c) for c in code_blocks]\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = \"\\n\".join(code_blocks)\n\n    return joined_code\n```\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```\n# Load the Markdown document\nmd = open(\"document.md\", \"r\")\n\n# Extract the Julia code blocks\ncode = extract_julia_code(md)\n\n# Print the extracted code\nprint(code)\n```\nThis should output the Julia code blocks from the Markdown document, without the code fences and with each block joined together with a newline.
