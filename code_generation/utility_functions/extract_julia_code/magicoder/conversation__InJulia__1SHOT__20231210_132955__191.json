[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is an example of how you could implement a function `extract_julia_code` in Julia to extract all the code blocks, remove code fences, and join the code blocks together with a newline:\n```\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use the \"CodeFence\" package to parse the markdown document\n    doc = CodeFence.parse(md)\n\n    # Extract all the code blocks\n    code_blocks = findall(doc, CodeFence.CodeBlock)\n\n    # Remove code fences from each code block\n    for i in 1:length(code_blocks)\n        code_block = code_blocks[i]\n        code_block[\"fences\"] = []\n        yield code_block\n    end\n\n    # Join the code blocks together with a newline\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* The `CodeFence.parse` function is used to parse the markdown document and extract all the code blocks.\n* The `findall` function is used to find all the code blocks in the document.\n* The `CodeFence.CodeBlock` constant is used to specify that we want to search for code blocks.\n* The `fences` attribute of each code block is modified to be an empty list, so that the code fences are removed.\n* The yield statement is used to iterate over each code block and remove its code fences.\n* The `join` function is used to join all the code blocks together with a newline.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[89,390],"elapsed":13.793946417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
