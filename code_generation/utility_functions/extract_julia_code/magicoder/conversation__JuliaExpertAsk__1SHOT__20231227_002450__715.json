Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `Md.jl` package to parse the Markdown file and extract the code blocks as strings, then remove the fences and join the code blocks together with a newline character.\n\nFirst, make sure you have Md.jl installed by running:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Md\")\n```\nHere is an example of how to write such a function `extract_julia_code`:\n\n```julia\nusing Md\n\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    blocks = parse_all(md, \"```julia\\n\")[1:2:end]\n    joined_blocks = join([replace(block.content, r\"^```.*|\\n.*?```$\", \"\") for block in blocks], \"\\n\")\n    return String(joined_blocks)\nend\n```\nIn this function `extract_julia_code`, it first uses the `parse_all` function to find all code blocks with Julia language. Then, it goes through each of these blocks, removes fences (both starting and ending) using `replace` function, then joins them together using `join`. Finally, it returns a string representation of the resulting joined code.\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that there is at most one code block per language in the input document. If there can be multiple blocks, you might need to adjust the logic accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[128,317],"elapsed":9.90197475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
