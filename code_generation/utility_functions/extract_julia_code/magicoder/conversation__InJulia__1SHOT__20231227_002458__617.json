[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String.

It assumes that every Julia code block starts with ` ```julia\\n` and ends with `\\n```. \n\nPlease note, this is a very simple implementation and may not handle all edge cases. For instance, it doesn't account for indented code blocks or escaped backticks in the code itself. It's also worth noting that it uses string interpolation (`$`) to build the final code string, which might be problematic if `code` is very large and causes performance issues due to memory usage of string concatenation.","status":200,"tokens":[89,283],"elapsed":8.709723667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
