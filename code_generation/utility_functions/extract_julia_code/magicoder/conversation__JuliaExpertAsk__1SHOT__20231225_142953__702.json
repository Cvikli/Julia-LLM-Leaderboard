Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution for the problem. \n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find and extract all code blocks, remove code fences (if any) and join them together with a newline. It returns the extracted, cleaned up Julia code as a string.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_julia_code(md):\n    # Regular expression for finding julia language code blocks\n    pattern = r'```(.*?)```'\n    \n    # Find all matches in markdown document\n    matches = re.findall(pattern, md)\n    \n    # If no matches found, return an empty string\n    if len(matches) == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Remove code fences and join blocks with newline\n    cleaned_code = \"\\n\".join([match[4:] for match in matches])\n    \n    return cleaned_code\n```\nIn this function, the regular expression `pattern` is looking for text that is between three backticks (```), which are typically used to delineate code blocks. The `.*?` specifier makes it non-greedy, meaning it will stop at the first set of closing backticks it encounters instead of going through the whole document. \n\nThe list comprehension `[match[4:] for match in matches]` is used to remove the four space indents that markdown adds by default before code blocks. \n\nThis function will return an empty string if there are no Julia language code blocks found in `md`.","status":200,"tokens":[128,334],"elapsed":10.359807667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
