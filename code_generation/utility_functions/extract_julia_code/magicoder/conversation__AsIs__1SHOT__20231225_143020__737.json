The `re.DOTALL` flag means \"match any character, including a newline\". The resulting list of matches is then joined into a single string with newlines between each match if there are multiple matches. \n\nIf there is only one code block or no blocks found, the function will return None. If you want to have an empty string instead of None when there's only one block, simply replace `return None` with `return \"\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[86,253],"elapsed":7.768126667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
