[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are provided a markdown document `md` with julia language code blocks. Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function `extract_julia_code` that meets the given specifications:\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # Split string into an array of lines\n    codeblocks = String[]  # Store extracted code blocks here\n\n    # Iterate over lines in markdown\n    for i in eachindex(lines)\n        line = lines[i]\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"```julia\") # Check if it's the start of a Julia code block\n            codeblock = \"\"  # Stores current code block\n            \n            while !isempty(line) && !startswith(line, \"```\") # Collect lines until end of the block\n                append!(codeblock, line[end])\n                \n                if i < length(lines) # If there are more lines in file\n                    i += 1\n                    line = lines[i]\n                else # If it's last line break loop\n                    break\n                end\n            end\n            \n            append!(codeblocks, codeblock) # Save the code block to array\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return join(codeblocks, \"\\n\") # Join all code blocks into a single string with newline separator\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each line of the markdown document. If it encounters a line that starts with \"```julia\", it knows that this is the start of a Julia code block. It will then collect all subsequent lines until it encounters a line that starts with \"```\" (indicating the end of the block).\n\nIt joins all collected lines together to form one long string, and appends this to an array. Once it has processed all the blocks, it returns a single string containing all the code. \n\nThe function does not take into account any potential indentation in the code blocks; it treats them as raw strings. It also assumes that there are no special characters or comments within the code block (other than those used to delimit it), and does not perform any kind of parsing on the Julia code itself.","status":200,"tokens":[389,480],"elapsed":16.813593375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
