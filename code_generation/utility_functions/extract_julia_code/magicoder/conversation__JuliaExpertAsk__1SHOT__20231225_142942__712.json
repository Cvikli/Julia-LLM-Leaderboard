Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::String)\n    # Find all code blocks. Each block starts with ``` and ends with ```\n    code_blocks = collect(eachmatch(r\"```julia\\n(.*?)\\n```\", md, 1))\n    \n    # Remove the first line (the language identifier) in each block and join them together\n    joined_code = join(map(x -> x.captures[1], code_blocks), \"\\n\")\n    \n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nThis function uses regular expressions to identify all occurrences of code blocks in the markdown document, where each block starts with ``` and ends with ``. It then removes the language identifier ('julia') from each block and concatenates them together.\nPlease note that this function will not handle edge cases such as indented code blocks or complex situations like different indents for different parts of the same code block. Also, it assumes the input is properly formatted markdown with julia code blocks.","status":200,"tokens":[128,236],"elapsed":7.410919417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
