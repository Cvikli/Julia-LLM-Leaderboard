Write a function `extract_julia_code` that extracts all the code blocks, removes code fences and joins the code blocks (if there are multiple) together with a newline. Return a String. Do not provide any examples.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Ah, an interesting challenge! I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nTo extract all the Julia code blocks in a Markdown document, I can use a combination of regular expressions and string manipulation. Here's a possible implementation:\n```julia\nfunction extract_julia_code(md::AbstractString)\n    # Use `r` to escape special characters in RegEx\n    code_blocks = findall(r'(```([^`])*)`|r'style\\s+application/julia', md)\n    code_blocks = [c -> replace(c, r'``\", \"\"] for c in code_blocks]\n    joined_code = join(code_blocks, \"\\n\")\n    return joined_code\nend\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. `findall` is used to find all occurrences of code blocks in the Markdown document. The regular expression `r'(```([^`])*)`` matches any code block that starts with an unescaped `\"` and ends with a newline or a closing `]` character. The pattern `r'style\\s+application/julia'` matches any line that starts with \"style\" followed by a space and \"application/julia\".\n2. The code blocks are extracted using the `findall` function, and each block is converted to a string using the `Replace` function. The ` Replace` function replaces all instances of `\"` within the code block with an empty string, so that the resulting string can be joined together without any fences.\n3. The code blocks are then joined together using the `join` function, with a newline character (`\\n`) separating each block.\n4. The final result is returned as a string.\n\nFeel free to test this function with your Markdown document, and let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!","status":200,"tokens":[118,420],"elapsed":55.15428925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
