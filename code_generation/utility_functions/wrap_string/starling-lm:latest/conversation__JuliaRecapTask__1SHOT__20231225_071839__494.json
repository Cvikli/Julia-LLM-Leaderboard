[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It splits the input string into words, then iterates over each word. If adding the length of the current line (including the space between words) and the length of the next word would exceed the `text_width`, it prints the current line and starts a new one. At the end of the function, if there is any remaining text in the `line` variable, it is printed to the console.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a sample string that should be wrapped around 10 characters per line.\")\nThis is a s\nample string t\nhat should be w\nrapped around \n10 characters p\ner line.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[375,316],"elapsed":11.815737625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
