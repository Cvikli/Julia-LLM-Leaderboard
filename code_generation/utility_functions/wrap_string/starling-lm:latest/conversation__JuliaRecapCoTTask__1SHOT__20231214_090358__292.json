[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Based on the given information, here's my systematic approach to solving the problem:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `for` loop with optional `index` parameter\n\t* `if-elseif-else` chaining\n\t* `isX ? X : Y` ternary operator\n\t* `array` and `slice` functions for working with arrays\n\t* ` Dictionary` type for storing key-value pairs\n\t* `$` symbol for string interpolation\n2. Define the problem and special instructions:\n\t* Task: Write a function `wrap_string` that iterates over words in a string and adds a new line each time the maximum `text_width::Int=10` is exceeded.\n\t* Special Instructions: If any are provided, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n3. Plan the solution:\n\t* Since the input string can have any number of words, we need to iterate over it and check the length of each word.\n\t* If the length of a word exceeds `text_width`, we will add a new line and continue iterating.\n\t* We will use a `for` loop with an optional `index` parameter to iterate over the words in the string.\n4. Write the function:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    for word in split(str)\n        if length(word) > text_width\n            println() # Add a new line\n            continue # Skip the current word\n        end\n        yield word # Return the word\n    end\nend\n```\n5. Test and double-check the solution:\n\t* Create a test case with a string that exceeds `text_width` and verify that the function adds a new line correctly.\n\t* Double-check that the function works correctly for all input strings and maximum `text_width` values.\n6. Reflect on the approach and any potential improvements:\n\t* We could optimize the function by using a `Vector` or `HashTable` to store the words instead of reiterating over the string each time.\n\t* We could also consider using a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a dynamic programming approach, to solve the problem more efficiently.\n7. Implement any improvements and test again:\n\t* If we decide to use a `Vector` or `HashTable`, we will need to modify the function accordingly.\n\t* If we choose to use a different algorithm, we will need to implement it and test it to ensure that it works correctly.\n\nBy following this systematic approach, we can solve the task efficiently and accurately while also considering any special instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[11,606],"elapsed":22.521409459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
