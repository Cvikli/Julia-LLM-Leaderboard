It ensures that adding another word doesn't surpass the specified maximum `text_width`. When this limit would be exceeded, the current line is pushed to a list of lines, and a new line is begun with the current word. Finally, it joins all lines using a newline character and returns the wrapped text.","status":200,"tokens":[93,240],"elapsed":18.008013834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
