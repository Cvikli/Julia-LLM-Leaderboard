Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Think through your approach step by step\n\nTo solve this problem, here is the outlined approach:\n\n1. Define a function `wrap_string` that takes a string and optional `text_width` parameter with a default value of 10.\n2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current line length and a result string.\n3. Split the input string into words.\n4. Iterate over each word:\n    - If adding the next word to the current line plus a space does not exceed the `text_width`, append the word to the current line.\n    - Otherwise, append the current line to the result string, followed by a newline character, and start a new line with the current word.\n5. After iterating through all words, append any remaining line to the result string.\n6. Return the result string.\n\n## Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n\nLet's implement the function following the described approach.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(s)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line == \"\" ? 0 : 1) <= text_width\n            # Add the word to the current line, with a space if it's not the first word\n            current_line *= (current_line == \"\" ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        else\n            # Append the current line to the result and start a new line\n            result *= (result == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * current_line\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Append any remaining line\n    result *= (result == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * current_line\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Solve the task\n\nNow we'll use the `wrap_string` function with the provided data.\n\n```julia\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n## Step 4: Check that your solution is correct\n\nThe expected output for the provided text should not have any line exceeding 10 characters, and words should not be broken up. Each word should be in the correct order as in the original string, with lines broken appropriately according to the specified width.","status":200,"tokens":[162,489],"elapsed":34.051254583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
