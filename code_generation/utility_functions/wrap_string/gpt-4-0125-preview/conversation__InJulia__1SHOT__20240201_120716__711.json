Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define the `wrap_string` function to iterate over the words in a given string and insert a newline character (`\\n`) when adding another word would exceed the specified maximum text width (`text_width`). Below is an example of how you might implement this function, with a default `text_width` of 10:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(s)\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            # If adding the next word exceeds the limit, insert a newline before it\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            wrapped_text *= word\n            current_line_length = word_length + 1  # +1 for the space\n        else\n            # If it's not the first word on the line, add a space before the word\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                wrapped_text *= \" \"\n                current_line_length += 1  # Account for the space\n            end\n            wrapped_text *= word\n            current_line_length += word_length\n        end\n        # Adjust for when text_width is smaller than the length of a word.\n        if word_length > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n    end\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a test string to demonstrate the wrap function in action.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(\"Wrapped text:\\n$wrapped_text\")\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- This function takes an input string `s` and an optional `text_width` argument with a default value of 10.\n- It splits the input string into words using `split(s)`.\n- It then iterates over each word, checking if adding this word to the current line would exceed the maximum `text_width`.\n- If adding the word would exceed the limit, it starts a new line (indicated by `\\n`) before adding the word.\n- The `current_line_length` is used to keep track of the current line's length, including spaces between words.\n- If a word in itself is longer than `text_width`, the code places that word on a new line and immediately starts a new line after it, ensuring that the function doesn't enter an infinite loop or exceed the text width with a single word without a breakpoint.\n- Finally, it returns the resulting wrapped text with inserted newlines as needed.\n\nThis code should help you achieve the desired text wrapping functionality in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[58,546],"elapsed":35.879161208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
