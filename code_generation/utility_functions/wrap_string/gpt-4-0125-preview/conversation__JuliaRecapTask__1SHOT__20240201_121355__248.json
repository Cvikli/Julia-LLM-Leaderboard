String manipulation and iteration over words.\n2. Keeping track of the current line length and comparing it with `text_width`.\n3. Accumulating the wrapped text using string concatenation or joining.\n4. Conditional checks for adding either spaces or newline characters.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(input_text)  # Splitting the input text into words\n    output_text = \"\"  # Initialize the output text\n    current_line_length = 0  # Initialize the current line length\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # If adding the next word exceeds text_width, append a newline before it\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            # Append a newline character before the word\n            output_text *= \"\\n$word\"\n            current_line_length = word_length  # Reset the current line length\n        else\n            # If this is not the first word in a line, prepend a space before adding the word\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                output_text *= \" $word\"\n                current_line_length += word_length + 1  # Account for the space\n            else\n                output_text *= word\n                current_line_length += word_length\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return output_text\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nLet's create an example to ensure the function works as intended. I'll provide a text that's clearly longer than our default `text_width` of 10. We can then observe how the function wraps the text.\n\n```julia\nexample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text)\nprintln(\"Wrapped Text:\\n$wrapped_text\")\n```\n\nUpon running the given example, we should see that each line of the printed `Wrapped Text` does not exceed 10 characters where possible, with words not being broken up. \n\nThis will confirm that the function's logic for text wrapping based on a specified width is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[316,475],"elapsed":32.343681083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
