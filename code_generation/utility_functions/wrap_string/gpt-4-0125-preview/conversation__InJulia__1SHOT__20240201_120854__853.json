It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here's a Julia function named `wrap_string` that takes two parameters: a string `s` and an optional maximum text width `text_width` with a default value of 10. The function iterates over the words in `s` and adds a newline character each time adding another word would exceed the specified `text_width`. It ensures that the words are wrapped according to the maximum width provided.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)  # Splits the string into words\n    current_line = \"\"  # Initialize the current line\n    output = \"\"  # Prepare the final output string\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the new word exceeds the text width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            # If so, append the current line to the output and start a new line\n            output *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            # If the line is not empty, add a space before appending the word\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line to the output\n    output *= current_line\n    return output\nend\n```\n\n### Example:\n\nNow, let's run an example of using the `wrap_string` function with a sample string and the default `text_width`.\n\n```julia\ns = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(s)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis should print the string with new lines inserted such that no line is longer than 10 characters, keeping words intact. Note that the actual wrapping will depend on the words in your sample string and the default `text_width`. If your string contains words longer than the `text_width`, those words will not be broken up and will appear on their own line, potentially exceeding the `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[58,435],"elapsed":36.510050292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
