Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Approach\n\n1. Think through the approach step by step:\n    - Split the input string into words based on spaces.\n    - Iterate over the words, keeping track of the current line length.\n    - If adding a new word would exceed the maximum text width, append a newline before the word.\n    - Otherwise, append the word to the current line.\n    - Keep adding words to the line until the next word would exceed the maximum width, then start a new line.\n    - Return the resulting string with properly wrapped lines.\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    wrapped_text = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # If adding the word exceeds text_width, start a new line\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(wrapped_text, current_line)\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            # If not the first word in the line, prepend a space\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(wrapped_text, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(wrapped_text, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task using the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct: \n\nThe resulting output should wrap words into new lines whenever adding a new word would exceed the 10 characters limit. The test data doesn't specify exact wrap points due to variances in word length and text width constraints, but an example output could look like this, depending on the exact implementation details:\n\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nNote: The actual output may vary in terms of where the lines are broken due to the dynamic nature of word lengths and the maximum text width specified.","status":200,"tokens":[162,452],"elapsed":34.738531458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
