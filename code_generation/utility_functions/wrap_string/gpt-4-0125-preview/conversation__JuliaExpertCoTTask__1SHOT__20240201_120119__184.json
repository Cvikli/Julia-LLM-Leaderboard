Define a function `wrap_string` that takes a string and an optional parameter `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n2. Split the given string into words.\n3. Iterate over each word:\n    - Keep a running total of the length of the current line.\n    - If adding the next word exceeds the `text_width`, add a newline character before it, and reset the line length count.\n    - Otherwise, add a space before the word (except for the first word) and add its length to the line length count.\n4. Return the wrapped string.\n\n### Step 2: Write The Function\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) <= text_width\n            wrapped_text *= (line_length == 0 ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n            line_length += length(word) + (line_length == 0 ? 0 : 1)\n        else\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\" * word\n            line_length = length(word)\n        end\n    end\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve The Task\nNow, let's use the function `wrap_string` with the provided data.\n\n```julia\nresult = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check That The Solution Is Correct\nAfter running the provided example, we should see that the output adheres to the 10-character maximum width per line, breaking the sentence into multiple lines accordingly. \n\nThis solution can now be tested.","status":200,"tokens":[162,380],"elapsed":42.112133834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
