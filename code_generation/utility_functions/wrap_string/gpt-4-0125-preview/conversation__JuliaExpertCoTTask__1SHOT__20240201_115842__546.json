It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Think through the approach\n\nTo solve this problem, I will write a function `wrap_string` which takes a string and optionally a maximum line width as input. The default line width is 10. The function will:\n\n1. Split the input string into words.\n2. Initialize an empty string for the output and a variable to keep track of the current line length.\n3. Iterate over each word:\n   - If adding the next word to the current line would not exceed the maximum width, add the word to the current line.\n   - If adding the next word would exceed the maximum width, add a newline to the output (to start a new line) before adding the word.\n4. Join the words with spaces, taking into account where new lines are needed.\n5. Return or print the final string.\n\n## Step 2: Write the function\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = split(s)\n    output = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding this word would exceed the max line width\n        if current_line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            # If adding this word exceeds the line width, start a new line\n            output *= \"\\n\"  # Add a newline character to output\n            current_line_length = 0  # Reset the current line length\n        end\n        \n        # Add the word to the output\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            output *= \" \"  # Add space before the word if it's not the beginning of a line\n        end\n        output *= word\n        current_line_length += length(word) + (current_line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0)  # Add the word length + a space if not at start\n    end\n    \n    return output\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Solve the task\n\nNow, I'll use the provided data to demonstrate the function.\n\n```julia\nexample_text = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\n## Step 4: Checking correctness\n\nThe output should display the input text, but with new lines inserted so that no line exceeds 10 characters, considering space as a character too.","status":200,"tokens":[162,490],"elapsed":49.363760292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
