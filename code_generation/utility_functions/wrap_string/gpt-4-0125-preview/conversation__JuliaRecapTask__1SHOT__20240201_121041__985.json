X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

To achieve this, we will:\n\n- Use string manipulation functions like `split` to divide the input into words.\n- Utilize a loop to iterate over the words.\n- Keep track of the current line length and compare it with the `text_width` to decide when to insert a new line.\n- Employ string concatenation or interpolation to construct the output.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        # Check if adding the next word exceeds the max line width.\n        # Include a space before the word unless it's the start of the line.\n        if current_line_length + word_length + (current_line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        # Avoid adding an extra space at the beginning of a line\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            wrapped_text *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n        \n        wrapped_text *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n### Provide an Example\n\nLet's test the function with a sentence that would require wrapping:\n\n```julia\nexample_text = \"Julia language is a high-performance, high-level, dynamic programming language.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis example should print the input string, with new lines inserted such that no line exceeds 10 characters, accounting for words not being split in the middle.","status":200,"tokens":[316,408],"elapsed":32.7607855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
