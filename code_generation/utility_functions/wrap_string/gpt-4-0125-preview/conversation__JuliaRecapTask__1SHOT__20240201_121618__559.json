X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The function will split the input string into words and iterate over them, appending each word to a `current_line` variable. If adding the next word would exceed `text_width`, a newline character is added to the `current_line` before appending the word. The `current_line` variable is concatenated to an accumulating `result` string, which is finally returned.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(input_str)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width # +1 for space\n            result *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= length(current_line) == 0 ? word : \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line\n    result *= current_line\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\n### Provide an Example\n\nNow, let's provide an example usage of the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\nexample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(example_text, 15))\n```\n\nThis example will split the input `example_text` into lines where each line will not exceed 15 characters in width. \n\n### Double-check the Solution \n\nTo double-check:\n\n- Ensure the function adheres to the specified `text_width` by not exceeding it with any line.\n- Verify the integrity of words; none should be split or altered.\n- Test with both the default and custom `text_width` values. \n\nGiven the straightforward logic and the careful setup of the string concatenation and line-checking, this solution is expected to correctly wrap the provided text without exceeding the specified width while maintaining the integrity of the words.","status":200,"tokens":[316,522],"elapsed":37.247842292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
