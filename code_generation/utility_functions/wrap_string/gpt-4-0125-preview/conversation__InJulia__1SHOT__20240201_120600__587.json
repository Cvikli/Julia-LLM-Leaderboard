Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, the function `wrap_string` below in Julia takes a string as input and wraps the text so that each line doesn't exceed a specified `text_width`. By default, `text_width` is set to 10. It separates the input text into words, understanding words as any sequence of characters separated by spaces. Then, it iterates over these words, adding each to a new line if including it would exceed the maximum width. Here's how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            # If adding the next word would exceed the limit,\n            # flush current_line to wrapped_text and reset current_line\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # If it's not the first word in a line, prepend a space\n            if current_line != \"\"\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Add the final line after the loop\n    wrapped_text *= current_line\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `wrap_string` function takes a given string and splits it into words. It then builds up lines one word at a time, being careful not to exceed the specified `text_width`. If adding another word would surpass that width, the current line is appended to the result string (`wrapped_text`), and a new line is started with the current word. Finally, it ensures any last line in progress is also added to the `wrapped_text`.\n\nPlease note, this simple algorithm assumes that no single word is longer than `text_width`. If you might deal with such words, you'd need a more sophisticated approach that also breaks individual words that are too long to fit.","status":200,"tokens":[58,450],"elapsed":30.589544583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
