Define the function `wrap_string` that takes a string and an optional parameter `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n2. Split the input string into words.\n3. Iterate through each word and construct lines such that adding a next word exceeds the `text_width`, then add a newline before that word.\n4. Join these lines and return the result.\n\n## Code\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    line = \"\"\n    current_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        if current_length + length(word) > text_width\n            line *= \"\\n\"\n            current_length = 0\n        elseif current_length > 0\n            line *= \" \"\n            current_length += 1\n        end\n        line *= word\n        current_length += length(word)\n    end\n    \n    return line\nend\n\n# Example\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis function starts a new line before adding a word that would exceed the maximum text width of 10 characters. Note that this implementation doesn't account for words themselves that exceed the text width; they are not split but included wholly on a new line.","status":200,"tokens":[162,261],"elapsed":18.870193166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
