X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, recall the Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n\n1. **String Manipulation**: Julia offers several built-in functions for string manipulation, such as `split()` to split a string into words, and `join()` that can be customized to join elements of an array into a string with a specified delimiter.\n\n2. **Loops and Conditional Statements**: Weâ€™ll likely use a `for` loop to iterate over the words in the provided text. Conditionals `if-elseif-else` will help in checking if appending a word would exceed the `text_width`.\n\n3. **String Interpolation**: The `$` symbol for including the value of a variable inside a string might come in handy, especially when building the result string.\n\n**Solving the Task**:\n\nThe function `wrap_string` will take input text and optionally a maximum `text_width`, iterating through each word of the input. It will construct a new string, adding words and ensuring that the addition of any new word does not exceed the `text_width`. If it would, it inserts a newline character before adding the word.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(text)\n    result = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        if line_length + word_length > text_width\n            result = result * \"\\n\" * word\n            line_length = word_length\n        else\n            if line_length > 0\n                result = result * \" \" * word\n                line_length += word_length + 1  # +1 for the space\n            else\n                result = word\n                line_length = word_length\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\n**Example**:\n\nLet's test our function with an example to ensure it's working as intended:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 20))\n```\n\nExpected output is a string where no line exceeds 20 characters, and words are wrapped to the next line as needed.\n\n**Double-checking the Solution**:\n- The function handles cases where the `text_width` is less than the length of a single word. In such cases, words aren't split but are placed on a new line as they exceed the limit.\n- It properly adds spaces between words and does not begin or end the line with unnecessary spaces.\n- The function's type annotations for its arguments and return value are consistent with its behavior and Julia's type system. \n\nThis solution appears to correctly implement the specified behavior using Julia standard libraries and language features.","status":200,"tokens":[316,560],"elapsed":41.843342334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
