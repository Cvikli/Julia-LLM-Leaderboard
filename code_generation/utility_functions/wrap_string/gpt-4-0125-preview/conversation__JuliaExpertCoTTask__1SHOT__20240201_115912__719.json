If it would, start a new line.\n4. **Return the result:** Combine all lines into a single string with newline characters where necessary.\n\n## Step by Step Solution\n\n### Step 1: Write the function\n\nLet's implement the steps outlined:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(s)  # Split the string into words\n    current_line = \"\"\n    lines = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the next word exceeds the text_width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)  # Save the current line\n            current_line = word  # Start a new line with the current word\n        else\n            # Append the word to the current line (add a space if not the first word)\n            current_line *= (current_line == \"\" ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the last line if it's not empty\n    if current_line != \"\"\n        push!(lines, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")  # Join all lines with a newline character\nend\n```\n\n### Step 2: Solve the task with the given Data\n\nNow, let's use the given string to test the function:\n\n```julia\nexample_output = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(example_output)\n```\n\nThis should produce an output that splits the input sentence into lines, each not exceeding 10 characters in length, breaking lines at word boundaries.","status":200,"tokens":[162,416],"elapsed":30.276228958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
