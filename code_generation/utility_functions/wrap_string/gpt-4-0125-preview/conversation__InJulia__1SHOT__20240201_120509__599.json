Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below, I've created a function named `wrap_string` in Julia that takes a string and wraps it so that each line does not exceed a specified maximum width. By default, this `text_width` is set to 10 characters. The function iterates over the words and adds a new line (`\\n`) each time adding another word would exceed the `text_width`. Spaces are considered part of the width, except for situations where a new line starts; in that case, we don't prefix the line with a space.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)  # Split the text into words.\n    wrapped_text = \"\"    # Initialize the wrapped text string.\n    current_line = \"\"    # Track the current line being constructed.\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the next word exceeds the line width.\n        # The '+1' accounts for space before the word, except when the line is empty.\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (length(current_line) > 0 ? 1 : 0) > text_width\n            # If it does, add the current line to the wrapped text and start a new line.\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word  # Start the new line with the current word.\n        else\n            # If not, add the word to the current line, with a space if it's not empty.\n            current_line *= (length(current_line) > 0 ? \" \" : \"\") * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # After the loop, add any remaining text.\n    wrapped_text *= current_line\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a sample piece of text to demonstrate how the wrapping function works.\"\nresult = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis script defines `wrap_string`, which takes your original string and organizes it so that no line exceeds the specified `text_width`, here defaulted to 10. It carefully handles spaces to ensure they're included in the character count but avoids placing unwanted spaces at the beginning of new lines. \n\nIn the example usage, calling `wrap_string` with a test string demonstrates how the function operates, breaking lines appropriately to respect the `text_width` constraint. Note that this function does not hyphenate words; if a single word is longer than `text_width`, it will appear on its own line, potentially exceeding the width limit.","status":200,"tokens":[58,519],"elapsed":38.949992208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
