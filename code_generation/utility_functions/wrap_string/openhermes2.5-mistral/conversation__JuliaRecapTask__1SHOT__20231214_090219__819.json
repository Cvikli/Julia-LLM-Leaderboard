[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Based on the information provided, I will approach this task as a Julia programmer with a systematic approach to solving problems. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n\n* Iterating over words in a string using the `split()` function\n* Creating a new line using the `\\n` character\n* Using the `Int` type for the maximum word width\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task\n\nI will write a function called `wrap_string()` that takes a string as input and wraps each word to a new line when the word width exceeds the maximum width specified by the user. Here is an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    # Split the input string into words using the split() function\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    \n    # Iterate over each word and wrap it to a new line if the width exceeds the maximum\n    for word in words\n        if length(word) > text_width\n            word = word*\"\\n\"*((length(word)-text_width)+1)\n        end\n        yield word\n    end\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nTo ensure that the function is working correctly, I will test it with a few examples. Here are the inputs and expected outputs for each example:\n\nExamples:\n\n* Input: \"This is a sample string.\"\n* Expected output: \"This\\nis\\nasample\\nstring.\"\n* Input: \"Hello World!\"\n* Expected output: \"Hello\\nWorld!\"\n* Input: \"This sentence is too long\"\n* Expected output: \"This\\nsentence\\istoolong\\n\"\n\nSince the user did not provide any special instructions, I will prioritize the guidelines provided above. In particular, I will use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to avoid being too restrictive and emphasize performance, clarity, and abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns!","status":200,"tokens":[365,491],"elapsed":21.05176975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
