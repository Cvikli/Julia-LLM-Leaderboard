The default value of `text_width` is set to 10. Let me break down the steps:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the function\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    # Step 2: Split the input into an array of words\n    words = split(text)\n    \n    # Step 3: Initialize variables to store final output and counter\n    output = \"\"\n    counter = 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Iterate over the words\n    for word in words\n        # Step 5: Check if new line is needed based on current text width\n        if counter * text_width <= length(output) + length(word)\n            output *= \"$word\\n\"\n            counter += 1\n        else\n            # Step 6: Add a newline and reset the counter\n            output = output * word\n            counter = 2\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return output\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with an example input string:\n\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n```\n\nThe result should be:\n\n```julia\n\"This\\nfunction will\\nwrap\\n  words into\\nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[184,343],"elapsed":65.294147458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
