The function `wrap_string` accepts a string and an optional integer `text_width`. If no text width is specified, the default value of 10 is used.\n2. The function first splits the input string into individual words using the `split` function.\n3. It then initializes an empty array (`result`) to store wrapped lines.\n4. A variable `current_line` is initialized as an empty string.\n5. It iterates over each word in the list of words (`for word in words`).\n6. For each word, it checks if adding the current word to the existing line would exceed the maximum text width. If it would, a new line is created and added to the `result` array, and the current word becomes the first word on the new line (by setting `current_line` to `\"\"`).\n7. If the current word can be added to the existing line without exceeding the text width, it concatenates the word with a space to the end of the current line (`current_line`).\n8. After iterating over all words in the input string, any remaining content in `current_line` is appended to the `result` array.\n9. Finally, the function returns the contents of `result` joined together using newlines (`\"\\n\"`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,546],"elapsed":29.456773921,"_type":"aimessage"}]
