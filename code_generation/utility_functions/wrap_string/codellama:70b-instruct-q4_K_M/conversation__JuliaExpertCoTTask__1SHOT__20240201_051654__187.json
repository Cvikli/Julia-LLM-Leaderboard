It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'd like to clarify that the task asks for a function with a default argument of `text_width::Int=10`. However, I don't have a default text width in my code. The task is also not clear about what should happen when a single word exceeds the maximum text width.\n\nAssuming that your input string may contain multiple words and you want to wrap them into lines with a maximum `text_width` of 10, here's an implementation:\n\n```julia-repl\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    result = \"\" # Initialize the output string\n    current_length = 0 # Keep track of the current line length\n\n    for word in split(input_str, \" \") # Iterate over words\n        if (current_length + length(word)) > text_width # If adding this word would exceed the width limit\n            result *= \"\\n\" # Add a new line\n            current_length = 0 # Reset the line length counter\n        end\n\n        result *= word # Add the word to the output string\n        result *= \" \" # Add a space after the word (unless it's the last one)\n        current_length += length(word) + 1 # Increment the line length by the length of the word and the space\n    end\n\n    return result # Return the wrapped string\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an input string and a `text_width` parameter (defaulted to 10 if not specified). It iterates over each word in the input string, checking whether adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If so, it inserts a new line before adding the word. Finally, it returns the wrapped string.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia-repl\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n\"This \\nfunction \\nwill wrap \\nwords into \\nlines \"","status":200,"tokens":[0,444],"elapsed":24.060498425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
