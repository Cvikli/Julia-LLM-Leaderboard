For each word, it checks if adding that word to the current line would exceed the maximum `text_width`. If so, it prints out the completed line and starts a new one. The function also takes care of printing any leftover words at the end of the loop.\n\n**Example usage:**\nTo use this function, simply call `wrap_string()` with the desired text as the first argument, optionally specifying the maximum width as a second argument (default is 10). For example:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n\n# Outputs:\n# The quick\n# brown fox\n# jumps over\n# the lazy dog\nwrap_string(text)\n\n# Outputs:\n# The quick\n# brown fox\n# jumps over\n# the lazy\n# dog\nwrap_string(text, 12)\n```\n\nThis will print out a wrapped version of `text` with each line having at most 10 characters (or whatever is specified). It preserves spaces between words and adds spaces when starting a new line. ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,548],"elapsed":29.417226102,"_type":"aimessage"}]
