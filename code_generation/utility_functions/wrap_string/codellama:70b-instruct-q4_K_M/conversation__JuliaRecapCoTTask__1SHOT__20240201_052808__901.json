[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It uses the `split` method to split the input string into an array of words and the `join` method with the `\\n` delimiter to join each word onto a single string.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    str = strip(str) # Remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    words = split(str) # Split the input string into an array of words\n\n    if length(words) == 0\n        return \"\" # If there are no words, return an empty string\n    end\n\n    lines = [words[1]] # Initialize the first line with the first word\n    line_length = length(lines[end]) # Keep track of the current line's length\n\n    for word in words[2:end] # Iterate over remaining words\n        if line_length + 1 + length(word) > text_width # Check whether adding this word would exceed the maximum width\n            push!(lines, word) # If so, start a new line with this word\n            line_length = length(word)\n        else\n            lines[end] *= \" $word\" # Otherwise, append it to the current line\n            line_length += 1 + length(word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\") # Join the lines with a newline delimiter and return the result\nend\n```\n\nHere is an example usage of the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\nstr = \"This is a long sentence that needs to be wrapped onto multiple lines\"\nmax_width = 20 # Maximum text width is 20 characters\nresult = wrap_string(str, max_width)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThe output would be:\n\n```\nThis is a long\nsentence that needs\nto be wrapped onto\nmultiple lines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,460],"elapsed":24.948939902,"_type":"aimessage"}]
