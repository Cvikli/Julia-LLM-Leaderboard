Sed eget orci velit.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(str))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nLorem ipsu\nm dolor si\nt amet, co\nnsectetur\nadipiscin\ng elit. Se\nd eget orc\ni velit.\n```\nHere is an explanation of the code:\n1. The `wrap_string` function takes a string (`str`) and an optional integer argument `text_width`, which represents the maximum line width before wrapping occurs.\n2. Inside the function, we use `split(str)` to separate the input string into individual words, ignoring spaces. This allows us to iterate over each word one by one.\n3. We initialize a variable called `result` to store our output and set its initial value to an empty string.\n4. We also define another variable called `current_len`, which we'll use to keep track of the current line length during the iteration. This will help us determine when to add new lines.\n5. Now, we iterate over each word in `words` using a for-loop. For each word, we check if adding it to our string would exceed the maximum width specified by `text_width`. If so, we insert a newline character (`\"\\n\"`) into `result`, followed by the current word, and then increment `current_len` with the length of the word plus one (to account for the added space).\n6. At this point, if adding the next word won't exceed our maximum line width, we simply add it to `result` along with a leading space (`\" \"`). We also update `current_len`.\n7. Finally, after the loop is finished, we return the generated string stored in `result`, except for its first character (which is a superfluous space). This is because the loop always prepends an extra space before each word during the iteration process.","status":200,"tokens":[0,645],"elapsed":34.81333149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
