[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString, text_width::Int)\nwords = split(s)\nlines = []\ncurrent_line = \"\"\nfor word in words\nif isempty(current_line) || length(current_line) + length(word) <= text_width\npush!(lines, current_line ~ \"~ \" & word)\npush!(current_line, \"\")\nelse\npush!(lines, current_line ~ \"\\n\" & word)\ncurrent_line = \"\"\nend\nend\nreturn join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the input string into words using `split(s)`. Then it iterates over these words. For each word, it checks if adding this word to `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`. If it's not, then it just adds the word to `current_line`, else it starts a new line with the current word and an empty string as its previous line. It does this for all words. At last, it joins the lines together with '\\n' to form the final result which is returned. \n\nPlease note that in Julia 1.0 (and later), `AbstractString` was introduced and it's a better way to represent strings compared to the `string` type that was used before. Also, this function does not handle special characters or multi-word expressions well due to its naive approach. For more complex string manipulations, we might need to use other libraries like `text` or `text_utils`.","status":200,"tokens":[349,399],"elapsed":11.835661333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
