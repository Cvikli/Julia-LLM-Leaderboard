It first splits the input text by spaces, then initializes two empty lists: one for storing the completed lines and another one for the current line being built. The function iterates through each word in the list of words and checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If that's the case, it adds the current line to the list of lines and starts a new line with the next word. Once all the words have been processed, the function joins the lines together with a newline character and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[182,328],"elapsed":18.784275583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
