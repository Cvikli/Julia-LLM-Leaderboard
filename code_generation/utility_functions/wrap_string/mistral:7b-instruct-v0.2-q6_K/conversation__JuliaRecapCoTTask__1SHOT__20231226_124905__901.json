[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

We define a function `wrap_string` with two arguments - the text to be wrapped and an optional argument `text_width`. The text is assumed to be of type `AbstractString`, and `text_width` is an integer with a default value of 10.\n2. We split the input text into words using a regular expression that matches one or more whitespace characters or a punctuation character.\n3. We create an empty array called `lines` to store each line of the wrapped text.\n4. We initialize an empty string called `line` that will be used as the current line being built.\n5. We use a `for` loop to iterate over each word in the list of words, and we check if adding the new word to the current line would exceed the maximum width (`text_width`). If so, we add the current line to the `lines` array and create a new empty line.\n6. We concatenate the current word with a space character to the current line string.\n7. After processing all words, we check if there's any text left in the `line` variable. If so, we add it to the `lines` array as the last line.\n8. Finally, we join all lines in the `lines` array with a newline character and return the wrapped text.\n\nNow let me provide an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a long string with multiple words that will be wrapped after every ten characters.\\nIt will also preserve punctuation.\")\n\"This is a long string with multiple words that will be\\nwrapped after every ten characters.\\nIt will also preserve punctuation.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[368,628],"elapsed":36.90604925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
