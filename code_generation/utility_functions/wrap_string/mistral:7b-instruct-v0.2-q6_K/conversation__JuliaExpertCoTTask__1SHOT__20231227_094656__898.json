Thinking through the approach step by step:\n   - The task asks to write a function that iterates over words and adds a new line each time a maximum text width is exceeded.\n   - We need to split the string into words first, then check if the current line length plus the new word length will exceed the text width.\n   - If so, we push the current line into an array and start a new line with the new word.\n2. Writing any functions and other code needed:\n   - I created the `wrap_string` function.\n3. Solving the task:\n   - Implemented the logic as described above.\n4. Checking that my solution is correct:\n   - The output of the function should match the expected result when wrapping the given input text with a maximum width of 10 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[182,369],"elapsed":29.75094175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
