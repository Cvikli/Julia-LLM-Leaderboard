[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

It then initializes an empty array called `lines` to store each line of the wrapped text, along with a variable `current_line` to keep track of the current line being built.\n\nThe function iterates over each word in the array, checks if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum width (defined by the `text_width` argument), and if so, adds the current line to the output lines array and starts a new line. Once all words have been processed, the last line is added to the output as well.\n\nThe final result is obtained by joining all the lines in the `lines` array with a newline character using the `join` function.","status":200,"tokens":[366,406],"elapsed":24.181759917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
