Here is the function `wrap_string` that meets the requirements you specified:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, width::Int=10)\n    # Iterate over each word in the input string\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    \n    # Keep track of the current line length\n    line_length = 0\n    \n    # Write each word on a new line if the line length exceeds the maximum width\n    for word in words\n        if line_length > width\n            print(\" \")\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        print(word)\n        line_length += len(word) + 1\n    \n    # Add a new line at the end of the string if the last word exceeded the maximum width\n    if line_length > width\n        print(\" \")\n    end\nend\n```\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\n```\nIn this example, the input string is \"This function will wrap words into lines\". The function iterates over each word in the input string and writes it on a new line if the line length exceeds the maximum width of 10 characters. The last word in the input string (\"lines\") has a length of 8 characters, so no additional new lines are added at the end of the string.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[175,332],"elapsed":12.351259458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
