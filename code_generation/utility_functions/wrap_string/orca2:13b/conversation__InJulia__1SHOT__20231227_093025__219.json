Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Hello, I am a helpful AI assistant. I can help you write code in Julia, a high-level programming language for scientific computing. To write a function `wrap_string`, you need to use the `split` and `join` functions to split the input string into words and join them with spaces or any other delimiter you want. You also need to use the `length` function to check the length of each word and compare it with the given text width. If the word is longer than the text width, you need to add a newline character `\\n` before joining the words together. Here is an example of how the function might look like:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String; text_width::Int=10)\n  # split the text into words by using space as a delimiter\n  words = split(text, \" \")\n  # initialize an empty string to store the wrapped text\n  wrapped_text = \"\"\n  # loop over the words and check the length of each word\n  for word in words\n    # if the word is longer than the text width, add a newline character before it\n    if length(word) > text_width\n      wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n    end\n    # join the words with spaces or any other delimiter\n    wrapped_text *= word * \" \"\n  end\n  # remove the trailing space at the end of the wrapped text\n  wrapped_text = strip(wrapped_text)\n  # return the wrapped text\n  return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a string as an argument and an optional text width. For example:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a sample text that will be wrapped.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\n```\n\nThe output of this code is:\n\n```\nThis is a sample text that will be wrapped.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[68,422],"elapsed":23.135909333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
