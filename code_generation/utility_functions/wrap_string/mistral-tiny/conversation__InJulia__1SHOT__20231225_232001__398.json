It contains multiple words that should be wrapped correctly.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text))\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as input and an optional `text_width` argument with a default value of 10. The function then splits the input string into words and iterates through them. If adding the current word would exceed the `text_width`, it creates a new line and continues with the next word. Once the input string has been processed, the function returns a string that consists of the wrapped lines.","status":200,"tokens":[62,318],"elapsed":2.853680916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
