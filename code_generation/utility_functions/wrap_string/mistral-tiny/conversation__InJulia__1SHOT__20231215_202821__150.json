It splits the text into words, then iterates through each word. If adding the word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it starts a new line and adds the current word to it. Finally, it returns a string containing all the lines.","status":200,"tokens":[62,343],"elapsed":2.981287,"_type":"aimessage"}]
