Split the input string into individual words.\n2. Initialize an empty string to store the wrapped lines.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current line width. Set it to 0.\n4. Iterate over each word.\n   - Check if adding the current word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If it does, add a new line and reset the current line width to 0.\n   - Add the word to the current line and update the current line width.\n5. Return the wrapped lines.\n\nNow I will write the code to implement this logic.","status":200,"tokens":[162,131],"elapsed":1.963158791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
