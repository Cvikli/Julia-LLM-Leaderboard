X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Split the input string into individual words.\n2. Initialize an empty string to store the wrapped version of the input string.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current line width. Set it to zero initially.\n4. Iterate over each word in the input string.\n5. Check if adding the current word to the wrapped string would exceed the `text_width`.\n   - If it does, add a new line character (`\\n`) to the wrapped string and reset the line width to zero.\n6. Add the current word and a space to the wrapped string.\n7. Update the line width by adding the length of the current word plus one (for the space).\n8.
