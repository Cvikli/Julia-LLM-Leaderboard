[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

X : Y` and `for` loops.\n- Arrays are denoted by `[1, 2, 3]`, and slicing is done with `a[1:2]`. Tuples are denoted by `(1, 2)`, and namedtuples are denoted by `(; name=\"Julia\", )`. Dictionaries are created using `Dict(\"key\" => value)`. The `$` character can be used for string interpolation.\n- Functions can be defined using `function f(x) end`, or they can be anonymous functions like `x -> x^2`.\n\nWith these tools, I will now write the function:\n\n```julia\nwrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(word) + length(line) > text_width\n            println(line)\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        line *= word\n    end\n    println(line)\nend\n```\nHere, the function takes two arguments: `text`, which is the string to be wrapped, and `text_width`, which is the maximum length of each line. The function first splits the text into words using `split(text, \" \")`. Then, it initializes an empty string called `line` and iterates over each word in the list of words. For each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum length. If so, it prints the current line, then resets the line to be empty. Finally, it prints the final line at the end of the function.\n\nHere is an example usage of the function:\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrap_string(text)\n```\nThis will print out the text with each line no longer than 10 characters, which is the default value for `text_width`. If you want to change the maximum length of each line, you can pass in a different value when calling the function. For example:\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a long string that needs to be wrapped.\"\nwrap_string(text, 20)\n```\nThis will print out the text with each line no longer than 20 characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,570],"elapsed":16.089313768,"_type":"aimessage"}]
