Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= word\n    end\n    push!(lines, current_line)\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. The `text` parameter is a string that contains the text to be wrapped.\n2. The `text_width` parameter is an integer that specifies the maximum width of each line. It defaults to 10 if not specified.\n3. The `split()` function is used to split the `text` into individual words based on spaces.\n4. An empty list called `lines` is created to store the lines of text.\n5. A string called `current_line` is created to store the current line being built.\n6. The `for` loop iterates over each word in the `words` list, and checks whether adding the word would exceed the maximum width specified by `text_width`. If it would, a new line is added to the `lines` list and the `current_line` string is cleared.\n7. The `current_line` string is then appended with the current word using the `*` operator.\n8. After all words have been processed, the `join()` function is used to combine the lines of text into a single string, separated by newline characters (`\\n`).\n9. The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,412],"elapsed":11.410733609,"_type":"aimessage"}]
