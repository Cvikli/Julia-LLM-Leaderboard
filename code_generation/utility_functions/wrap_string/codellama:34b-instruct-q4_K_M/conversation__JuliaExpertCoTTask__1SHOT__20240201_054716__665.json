It splits the text into words using the `\" \"` (space) character, and then iterates over each word. For each word, it checks if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If it would, it starts a new line and resets the line length to zero.\n\nThen, it adds the current word to the result string and increments the line length by the length of the word plus one (to account for the space between words). Finally, it returns the resulting string with wrapped lines.\n\n# Example\n\nHere's an example usage of the `wrap_string` function:\n```julia\njulia> text = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\njulia> wrap_string(text)\n\"This function\\nwill wrap\\nwords into\\nlines\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,426],"elapsed":11.919049235,"_type":"aimessage"}]
