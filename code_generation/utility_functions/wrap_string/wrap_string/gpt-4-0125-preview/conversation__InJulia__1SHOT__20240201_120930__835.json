Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, writing a function to wrap text at a specified width requires careful iteration over words, ensuring that adding another word doesn't exceed the desired line width. Below, I've provided an implementation of the `wrap_string` function. This function takes a string and, optionally, a maximum text width (`text_width`) as arguments. It then returns a new string where new lines are added to prevent any line from exceeding the specified width.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            # If adding the next word exceeds the limit, \n            # append the current line to wrapped text and start a new line\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            # If the current line is not empty, add a space before the next word\n            if current_line != \"\"\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Add the final line to the wrapped text\n    wrapped_text *= current_line\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nIn this example, `wrap_string` starts with an empty `wrapped_text` string to collect the final result and an empty `current_line` string to build lines word by word. It iterates over each word in the input `text`:\n\n- If adding the next word to the `current_line` would exceed the `text_width`, it appends `current_line` to `wrapped_text` with a newline character, then starts a new `current_line` with the current word.\n- If adding the word does not exceed the line width, it checks if `current_line` is not empty (to avoid leading spaces) and then appends the word—preceded by a space if necessary—to `current_line`.\n- Finally, it adds any remaining `current_line` to `wrapped_text` because the loop might end with an unfinished line.\n\nThis algorithm ensures that no line in `wrapped_text` exceeds the specified width, breaking lines at space characters between words. Use the example to see how this function operates on a sample input string.","status":200,"tokens":[58,509],"elapsed":35.97186125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
