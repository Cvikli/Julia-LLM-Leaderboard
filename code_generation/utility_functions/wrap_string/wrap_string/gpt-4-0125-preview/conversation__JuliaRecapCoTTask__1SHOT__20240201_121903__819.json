X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Spaces are added between words as needed, and a new line character (`\\n`) is inserted before a word if adding the word would exceed the `text_width`.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::AbstractString\n    words = split(str)\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        if current_line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            # Add a newline before the word if adding it would exceed the text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            wrapped_text *= word\n            current_line_length = length(word)\n        else\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                # Add a space before the word if it's not the beginning of a line\n                wrapped_text *= \" \"\n                current_line_length += 1  # Account for the space\n            end\n            wrapped_text *= word\n            current_line_length += length(word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Double-Check the Solution\n\nTo verify the correctness of the `wrap_string` function, consider the following example:\n\n```julia\nexample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(example_text, 15)\n\nprintln(\"Original Text: \", example_text)\nprintln(\"Wrapped Text: \", wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis example uses a `text_width` of 15, which means each line of the wrapped text will not be longer than 15 characters, considering words are not split in the middle. It should demonstrate that the function correctly wraps text, respecting the `text_width` parameter.\n\nThe final output should look organized, with new lines inserted appropriately before words that would cause the line to exceed the defined `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[317,481],"elapsed":46.425940917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
