Think through the approach: \n    - We will iterate over each word in the input string.\n    - Maintain a current line length to compare against the `text_width`.\n    - If adding the next word exceeds `text_width`, insert a newline before adding the word.\n    - Keep track of word spacing.\n2. Write the function following the approach.\n3. Solve the task using the provided data.\n4. Check if the solution is correct.\n\n### Writing the function\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"  # Start a new line\n            current_line_length = 0  # Reset line length\n        elseif current_line_length > 0\n            wrapped_text *= \" \"  # Add space before word if it's not the starting of a line\n            current_line_length += 1  # Include space in line length\n        end\n        \n        wrapped_text *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n### Example\n\nNow, testing the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\n### Expected output\n\nThe output should wrap words without exceeding a line width of 10 characters. Given the nature of this task, the exact output would depend on the words' lengths and spaces being considered. A possible output could look like:\n\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[162,372],"elapsed":31.679423833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
