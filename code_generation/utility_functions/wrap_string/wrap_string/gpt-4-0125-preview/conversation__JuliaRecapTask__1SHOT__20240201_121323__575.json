X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish this, the `wrap_string` function will take an input string, split it into words, then iteratively build a new string. While building this new string, it will keep track of the current line length and insert a newline character whenever adding the next word would exceed the `text_width` limit. Let's dive into the solution.\n\n### 1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\n- The `split` function to split the input string into words.\n- A `for` loop to iterate over each word.\n- String interpolation or concatenation for constructing the new string.\n- Conditional statements to check if the current line length plus the next word length would exceed the `text_width`.\n\n### 2. Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text)  # Split input string into words\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # If adding this word exceeds text_width, add a newline before the word\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"  # Add newline to wrapped_text\n            wrapped_text *= word  # Add the word after the newline\n            current_line_length = word_length  # Reset current_line_length\n        else\n            # If not the first word on the line, prepend a space before adding\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                wrapped_text *= \" \"\n                current_line_length += 1  # Account for the space\n            end\n            wrapped_text *= word  # Add the current word\n            current_line_length += word_length  # Update current_line_length\n        end\n    end\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n### 3. Example\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThe above example splits a sentence into lines where each line does not exceed 10 characters if possible.\n\n### 4. Double-check that the solution is correct\n\n- The function handles the basic case of wrapping text without exceeding the given width.\n- It accounts for words longer than the `text_width` by placing them on a new line, so there won't be a scenario where a single word is split across lines, given the task's constraints.\n- It properly resets line length tracking after inserting new lines.\n- Spaces are appropriately handled not to start a new line with a space and not to end a previous line with an unnecessary space.\n\nThis logic should work as expected, given the problem statement and constraints.","status":200,"tokens":[316,562],"elapsed":45.724477417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
