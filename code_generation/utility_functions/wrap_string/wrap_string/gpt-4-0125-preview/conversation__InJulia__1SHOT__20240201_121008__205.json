Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can achieve this task by defining a `wrap_string` function that iterates over the words in a given string and adds a newline character (`\\n`) each time adding another word would cause the length of the line to exceed a specified maximum width (`text_width`). Below is an example implementation of the `wrap_string` function, followed by an example of how to use it:\n\n```julia\n# Define the wrap_string function\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s) # Split the string into words based on spaces\n    current_line_length = 0\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding the next word exceeds the maximum width\n        if current_line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            # If so, add a newline before the word (except for the first line)\n            result *= (current_line_length == 0 ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * word\n            current_line_length = length(word) # Reset the line length\n        else\n            # Else, add the word to the same line (with a space if not the first word in the line)\n            result *= (current_line_length == 0 ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n            current_line_length += length(word) + (current_line_length == 0 ? 0 : 1) # Add the word's length (+1 for the space if not first)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\nexample_string = \"Julia is a high-performance, high-level, dynamic programming language.\"\nwrapped_string = wrap_string(example_string, 15)\nprintln(\"Wrapped text:\\n$wrapped_string\")\n```\n\nThis example uses a simple linear approach to split the original string into words and then iteratively checks if adding the next word to the current line would exceed the maximum `text_width`. If it would, it starts a new line by adding a newline character before that word; otherwise, it just adds the word to the current line (with a preceding space if it's not the first word in the line). \n\nNote that special handling is in place to avoid adding unnecessary spaces at the beginning of lines or an unnecessary newline at the very start. Adjustments can be made to this basic implementation to accommodate different requirements, such as dealing with very long words that exceed `text_width` on their own.","status":200,"tokens":[58,495],"elapsed":38.15386475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
