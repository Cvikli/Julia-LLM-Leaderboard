Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can create the `wrap_string` function by iterating through each word of a given string and check if adding that word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`. If it would, you add a newline character before the word in the output string. Here's how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)  # Splits the input string into a list of words\n    current_line_length = 0\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        \n        # Check if adding this word would exceed the text width\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            # Start a new line if adding the word would exceed the width\n            result *= \"\\n\"  # Adds a newline character to start a new line\n            current_line_length = 0  # Resets the line length for the new line\n        end\n        \n        # Add space before the word if it's not the start of a new line\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            result *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1  # Account for the space\n        end\n        \n        result *= word  # Add the current word to the result\n        current_line_length += word_length  # Update the line length\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThe output should look something like: each line of the printout should not exceed the `text_width` you set, in this case, 10 characters. Since this example is based on a static `text_width` and does not account for word sizes exceeding the `text_width`, you might see some lines longer than expected if a single word exceeds the `text_width`. Adjustments could be made to handle such cases depending on the desired behavior (like breaking very long words with a hyphen or simply allowing exceptions for long words).","status":200,"tokens":[58,439],"elapsed":40.201284208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
