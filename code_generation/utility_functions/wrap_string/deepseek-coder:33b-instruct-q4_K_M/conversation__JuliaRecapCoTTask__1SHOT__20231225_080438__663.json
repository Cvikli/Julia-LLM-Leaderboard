[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

This is a test.\", 10))\n# Outputs:\n# Hello World.\n# This is a\n# test.\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the input string into words, then iterating over them. If adding a word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`, it adds the line to the output and starts a new line with the current word. It repeats this until all words have been processed. The final line is added without checking its length because it's guaranteed to be shorter than `text_width`.\n\nThe function assumes that no single word can exceed the `text_width`, which would require hyphenation or other complex text wrapping behavior, which this function does not implement. If a word exceeds `text_width`, an error is thrown. The output will always end with a newline character because it's added before adding a word to the line.","status":200,"tokens":[394,385],"elapsed":77.030566583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
