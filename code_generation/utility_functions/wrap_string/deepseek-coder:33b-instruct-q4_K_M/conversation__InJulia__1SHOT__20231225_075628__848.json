Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function in Julia that should do what you want:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String; text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    result = \"\"\n    line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        \n        result *= \"$word \"\n        line_length += length(word) + 1  # Add 1 for the space between words.\n    end\n    \n    return strip(result)  # Strip to remove trailing spaces from last line.\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into words, then iterates over these words. It keeps track of the length of the current line and adds a newline whenever this would exceed `text_width`. The word is added to the result string and its length (plus one for the space) is added to `line_length`.\n\nExample:\n\n```julia\ns = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum \ndolor sit \namet, \nconsectetur \nadipiscing \nelit.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[65,328],"elapsed":59.02524475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
