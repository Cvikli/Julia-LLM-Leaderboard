Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `wrap` function from the TextWrap module to split a string into lines of specified width. Here is how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing TextWrap # Import the TextWrap module\n\nfunction wrap_string(s::String; text_width::Int=10) \n    return TextWrap.wrap(s, text_width) # Use the `wrap` function from the TextWrap module\nend\n\n# Testing on an example string\nstr = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nprint(join(wrap_string(str), \"\\n\")) # join the output with newlines to print it line by line\n```\n\nThe function `wrap_string` takes a string and a text width as arguments. It then uses the TextWrap module's `wrap` function, which splits the input string into lines of specified maximum length (text width). The lines are then joined together with newline characters to print each line separately. \n\nMake sure that you have installed the `TextWrap` package in your Julia environment for this code to work. If not, you can add it using the `Pkg` mode in the REPL by running:\n```julia\n]add TextWrap\n```","status":200,"tokens":[187,273],"elapsed":80.532546208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
