Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input)\n    lines = []\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width || !isempty(lines)\n            pushfirst(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = word * \" \"\n        else\n            current_line *= word * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    pushfirst(lines, current_line)\n    return join(reverse(lines), \"\\n\")\nend\n\nexample_string = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"\nprintln(\"Before wrapping:\")\nprintln(example_string)\nprintln()\n\nprint(\"After wrapping:\\n\")\nprintln(wrap_string(example_string))\n```\n\nIn this function, we first split the input string into words. We then iterate over each word and check if adding it to our current line would exceed `text_width`. If so, we push the current line onto `lines` and start a new line with the word. If not, we just add the word to the current line. After all words have been processed, we join `lines` into a string where each line is separated by a newline character.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no hyphenation or punctuation marks at the end of each word which would make its length exceed the text width if split into separate lines. The function also does not handle words longer than `text_width` correctly. It is recommended to use a library like `WordWrap.jl` for more sophisticated wrapping functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[106,402],"elapsed":69.913892125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
