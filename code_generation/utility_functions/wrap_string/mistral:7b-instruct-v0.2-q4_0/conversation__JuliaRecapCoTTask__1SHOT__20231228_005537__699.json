X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Defining functions\n   - Splitting strings into words\n   - String concatenation and interpolation\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString; text_width::Int = 10)\n    words :: AbstractVector{SubString{Char}} = split(text, r\"(\\\\s+|[.,!?])\\s*\")\n    line :: String = \"\"\n    result :: Union{String, Vector{String}} = []\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(result, line)\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        line *= word * \" \"\n    end\n\n    if length(line) > 0\n        push!(result, line)\n    end\n\n    join(result; separator = \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThis function takes a text string as an argument and wraps each word in a new line if the maximum width (default 10 characters) is exceeded. The function first splits the text into words, then iterates through them. If adding the current word to the current line would cause it to exceed the given width, a new line is started instead. Finally, all lines are joined together and returned as a single string.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing Printf\n\n@testset \"wrap_string\" begin\n    @test wrap_string(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\") == join(split(wrap_string(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"; text_width = 5), \"\\n\"), \"\\n\")\n    @test wrap_string(\"Hello, world!\") == \"Hello\\nworld!\"\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[368,456],"elapsed":16.267313292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
