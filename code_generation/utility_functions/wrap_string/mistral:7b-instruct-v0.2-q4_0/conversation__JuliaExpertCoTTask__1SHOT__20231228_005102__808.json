Then, we iterate through each word and check whether adding it to the current line will exceed the maximum width. If so, we add the current line to a list of lines and start a new line with the next word. Finally, we return a single string containing all the lines joined by a newline character.","status":200,"tokens":[182,310],"elapsed":11.391599042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
