It adds each word to the `output` with a space between them. If the current line's length plus the next word's length exceeds the `text_width`, a new line is added before appending the word.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n\n```julia\ninput = \"This is my long sentence. It will be split into multiple lines.\"\noutput = wrap_string(input, 10)\nprintln(output) # prints \"This is my\\nlong\\nsentence.\\nIt will\\nbe split\\ninto\\nmultiple\\nlines.\"\n```\n\nNote: This function assumes that words are separated by a single space. If there are multiple spaces between words, this function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":14.439714565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
