Due to security protocols, all messages need to be encrypted and then decrypted using a complex algorithm. However, due to space limitations on the network, messages should not exceed certain lengths before being split into multiple lines.\n\nYou have received two separate encrypted messages:\n\nMessage 1: \"Hdwklvwlvhvhfubswrudqjrwlrq\" (decrypted)\nMessage 2: \"Rpohuobdphlqjbtwyhgvoqgrxhgvoqgrxhgvoqgrxhgvoq\" (decrypted)\n\nBoth messages have been encrypted using the same cipher, which is similar to your `wrap_string` function. However, this time the message encryption algorithm has a catch: every 10th letter of each word should be shifted by 3 positions in the alphabet for decryption. For example, \"d\" would become \"g\", and so on.\n\nQuestion: Can you decrypt both messages?\n\n\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to understand that shifting the letters by 3 positions means replacing 'a' with 'd', 'b' with 'e', and so on. The goal is to decrypt these messages using our `wrap_string` function in reverse.\n\nFirstly, we'll have to split each message into words based on space (' '). After that, for every 10th letter of the word, shift it back 3 places in the alphabet. This will allow us to retrieve the original text message from each word.\nWe then apply our `wrap_string` function but this time with a different logic: the width is now set to the length of each line (i.e., number of characters before space or end of the line). If a word doesn't fit into a single line, we add it to the last line.\n\nLet's decrypt the first message: \"Hdwklvwlvhvhfubswrudqjrwlrq\" (decrypted) by shifting every 10th letter back 3 positions in the alphabet. This gives us: \"This is a test of the wrap string function.\". \nNext, we apply our `wrap_string` function with line width set to 11 (the length of 'This is'). The result is \"This is\".\nHowever, this doesn't match the original message. By applying reverse logic from step 1 and shifting every 10th letter back 3 positions in the alphabet, we get \"Hdwklvwlvhvhfubswrudqjrwlrq\". This is our decrypted first message.\nSimilarly, for the second encrypted message: \"Rpohuobdphlqjbtwyhgvoqgrxhgvoqgrxhgvoqgrxhgvoq\" (decrypted), shifting every 10th letter back 3 positions in the alphabet gives us: \"This is a test of the wrap string function.\".\nNext, we apply `wrap_string` with line width set to 11 and get: \"Rpohuobdphlqjbtwyhgvoqgrxhgvoqgrxhgvoq\". However, this doesn't match our decrypted second message. Applying reverse logic from step 1, we shift every 10th letter back 3 positions in the alphabet and get: \"Rpohuobdphlqjbtwyhgvoqgrxhgvoqgrxhgvoqgrxhg\". This is our decrypted second message.\n\nAnswer: The first decrypted message is \"Hdwklvwlvhvhfubswrudqjrwlrq\" and the second one is \"Rpohuobdphlqjbtwyhgvoqgrxhgvoqgrxhgvoq\".","status":200,"tokens":[94,1085],"elapsed":29.856157333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
