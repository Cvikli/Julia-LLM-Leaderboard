One puzzle in particular involves a cryptic message encoded in a string. \n\nYour function `wrap_string` is key to this puzzle. The cryptic message is made up of words, and each word has been wrapped within lines, as described above. However, there's a catch: you can only view the puzzle if the total number of characters (not including spaces) in the string exceeds 100.\n\nYour task is to write a function `decode_message` that takes the wrapped string from `wrap_string`, counts the total number of characters and checks whether it's more than 100. If it does, it should print \"You've solved the puzzle!\" If not, it should return \"The puzzle is too short.\"\n\nUse this function to check the message:\n```swift\nlet exampleString = \"This is a very long sentence that needs to be split into multiple lines because it exceeds the text width of 10\"\nlet wrappedText = wrap_string(exampleString, text_width: 20)\nif decode_message(wrappedText) == \"You've solved the puzzle!\" {\n    print(\"Congrats! You successfully decoded the message.\")\n} else {\n    print(\"The puzzle is too short. Try again with a longer message.\")\n}\n```\n\n\nQuestion: What should be your next step to make the game more challenging?\n\n\nConsider the property of transitivity and proof by exhaustion. The current puzzle, although challenging, could be made more complex by incorporating the condition that the cryptic message must include at least one word from each line (wrapped within lines).\n\nUsing inductive logic and deductive reasoning, it's logical to conclude that for a string with multiple words in each line, there are multiple possible combinations of words. Therefore, we could add an additional check in `decode_message` function that requires the cryptic message must include at least one word from each line (wrapped within lines). \n\nAnswer: Your next step to make the game more challenging is to ensure that the decoded message includes at least one word from each line. This could be achieved by introducing a condition in your `decode_message` function to check for this requirement before declaring it solved or not, thus making the puzzle more complex and engaging.","status":200,"tokens":[54,723],"elapsed":18.935156041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
