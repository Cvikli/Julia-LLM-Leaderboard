The main feature of the app is displaying an image with different parts and each part corresponds to a particular function in the IoT device. \n\nThe dimensions of the main image should be such that no function's text exceeds a maximum width of 10 characters, which will be taken from the `wrap_string` function discussed above. The team provides you with three functions:\n1. Temperature reading\n2. Humidity level\n3. Light intensity\n\nNow your task is to divide the image into three parts and place each function's text in a separate part without exceeding 10 characters per line.\n\nQuestion 1: Can you figure out how many words will be there for each function considering that words can be split across lines?\nQuestion 2: How many times should the text wrap if the word count exceeds the maximum limit?\n\n\nLet's assume that all functions' texts are represented as Strings and they have exactly one word. So, we need to find out how many times the text will wrap considering a maximum of 10 characters per line in `wrap_string` function. \nThis is a direct proof because it directly proves our assumption. We know each line can hold up to 10 characters. But the `text` string might exceed this limit if it contains more than 10 words. So, we need to find how many times the text will wrap. This requires us to count the number of words in each function's text.\n \nThe temperature reading has one word: 'Temperature'. It fits perfectly on a line so there is no need for wrapping.\nHumidity level also has one word: 'Humidity', which fits exactly on a line as well.\nLight intensity, however, has two words: 'Light' and 'intensity'. This will exceed the 10 character limit if placed in one line. So, we have to wrap it up. To do that, we split 'Light' into two lines: 'Light' and 'intensity', both of which are less than or equal to 10 characters per line.\nAnswer 1: The word count for each function will be 1 (Temperature reading), 1 (Humidity level) and 2 (Light intensity). \nAnswer 2: Light Intensity's text should wrap twice in the `wrap_string` function, once for 'Light' and again for 'intensity'.","status":200,"tokens":[94,729],"elapsed":19.365063542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
