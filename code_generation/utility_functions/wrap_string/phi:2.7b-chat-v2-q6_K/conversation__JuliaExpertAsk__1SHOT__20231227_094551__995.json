You're tasked with designing a function that takes as input a string of text, similar to a journal entry or a description of experimental results, and returns a new string where each line is no longer than a specified width. This is useful when you have to report long strings of data in an organized manner without overwhelming your audience.\n\nThe \"wrap_string\" function from the previous conversation can be used as a reference for this task. Now consider a scenario:\n\nYou're analyzing the growth rate of three different plant species, A, B and C over a period of ten weeks. The growth data is recorded as a string:\n\ngrowth_data = \"A-2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\\nB-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\\nC-3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12\"\n\nThe \"wrap_string\" function would take this string as input and return a new string where each line contains the growth rate data for one of the plant species, with a maximum width of 10 characters per line. \n\nYour task is to write a function that performs this operation on the growth_data string using the wrap_string function from the previous conversation.\n\nQuestion: What would be the new formatted output?\n\n\nFirst, you need to apply the \"wrap_string\" function to each species individually in the given text. This can be achieved by splitting the data based on the \"\\n\" character and applying the function to each line separately.\n\nThen, join all the resulting lines back together into a single string separated by newline characters (\"\\n\").\n\nAnswer: The result of the operation would look like this:\nA-2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\nB-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\nC-3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12","status":200,"tokens":[94,575],"elapsed":15.256642333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
