It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str, text_width = 10)\n    res = \"\"\n    for word in split(str)\n        if length(res) + length(word) > text_width\n            res *= \"\\n\"\n        end\n        res *= word\n    end\n    return res\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we define a function `wrap_string` that takes two arguments: the first argument is the input string, and the second argument is the maximum text width. If the second argument is not provided, it defaults to 10.\n\nThe function starts by initializing an empty string variable `res`. We then iterate over each word in the input string using the `split` function. For each word, we check if adding the length of the current word to the length of the previous line would exceed the maximum text width. If it does, we append a new line character (`\\n`) to the output string.\n\nNext, we append the current word to the output string using `res *= word`. We continue this process until we have iterated over all words in the input string. Finally, we return the resulting output string.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the function:\n```julia\nstr = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nprint(wrap_string(str))\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill\nwrap\nwords\ninto\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[193,325],"elapsed":13.39338615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
