X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n\t* `string` type with methods such as `split`, `join`, and `length`\n\t* `isempty` function to check if a string is empty\n2. Solve the task:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text, text_width=10)\n    lines = []\n    for word in split(text)\n        # Check if the current line would exceed the maximum width\n        if length(word) + length(\" \") > text_width\n            push!(lines, \"\")  # Add a new line\n        end\n        # Add the current word to the last line\n        append!(lines[end], word)\n    end\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with different inputs and verify that the output is as expected.\n\nNote: The above implementation uses the `split` method to split the input string into words, which is more efficient than using a regular expression to match words. Additionally, it uses `append!` to append each word to the last line of the list, which is also more efficient than concatenating strings with `*`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,292],"elapsed":4.03973797,"_type":"aimessage"}]
