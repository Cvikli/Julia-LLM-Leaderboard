It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded.

If so, it starts a new line and continues processing the next word. At the end, all the lines are joined together with a newline character as separator.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","status":200,"tokens":[182,265],"elapsed":11.289807458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
