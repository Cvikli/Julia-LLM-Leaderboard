Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

I'll follow your preferred approach to solving problems in Julia while taking into account any special instructions you provide.\n\nFor the `wrap_string` function, I will write it in a systematic way by following these steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Iterating over words in a string using `split()`\n\t* Checking the length of a string using `length()`\n\t* Adding new lines using `println()`\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Write a function `wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int = 10)` that takes a string `text` and an optional `text_width` parameter. If `text_width` is provided, the function will wrap the string at that width. Otherwise, it will wrap at 10 words per line.\n\t* Inside the function, use `split()` to split the input string into an array of words.\n\t* Use a loop to iterate over the words and check their length. If the length exceeds the current line width, add a new line and start the word count from 0.\n\t* Once all words are processed, print the wrapped string using `println()`.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with some sample inputs to ensure it works as expected.\n\nHere's the implemented function:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int = 10)\n    # Split the input string into an array of words\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    \n    # Wrap the string at the specified width or 10 words per line\n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        if length(words[i]) > text_width\n            println()\n            words[i] = \"$words[\" & String(\"Line\", i) & \":\\n$words[i]\"}\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Print the wrapped string\n    println(join(words, \" \"))\nend\n```\nPlease provide any special instructions or additional requirements for this task.","status":200,"tokens":[11,463],"elapsed":16.924236041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
