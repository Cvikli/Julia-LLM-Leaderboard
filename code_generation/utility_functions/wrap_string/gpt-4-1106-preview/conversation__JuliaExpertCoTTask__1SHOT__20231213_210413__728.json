Define the function `wrap_string` that accepts a string and a keyword argument `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n2. Split the input string into words.\n3. Iterate over the words, keeping track of the current line length.\n4. Concatenate words to the current line until adding another word would exceed the `text_width`.\n5. When the `text_width` is about to be exceeded, append a newline character and reset the current line length.\n6. Accumulate the lines into a result string.\n7. Return the result string after the iteration is complete.\n\n## Write any functions and other code you need\n\nHere's the Julia code for the `wrap_string` function.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words\n        if current_line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n\n        # If current line is not empty, add a space before appending the word\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            wrapped_text *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n        \n        wrapped_text *= word\n        current_line_length += length(word)\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n## Solve the task\n\nI will use the function to wrap the provided string:\n\n```julia\nexample_output = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(example_output)\n```\n\n## Check that your solution is correct\n\nAfter executing the provided example, I will check the output to confirm that the lines do not exceed the specified text width and that words are not broken in the middle. The wrapped text should be readable and respect the `text_width` limit.","status":200,"tokens":[162,402],"elapsed":50.623286833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
