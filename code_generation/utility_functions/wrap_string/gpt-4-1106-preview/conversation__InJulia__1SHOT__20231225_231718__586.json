It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is the Julia function `wrap_string` that takes two arguments: `text::String` which is the string to be wrapped and `text_width::Int=10` which is the maximum line width before a word should be moved to a new line. \n\nThe function uses a loop to iterate over the words and checks if adding the next word would exceed the maximum line width. If so, it adds a line break before the word.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        # If adding the word exceeds line width, add a new line (unless it's the first word on the line).\n        if current_line_length + length(word) > text_width && current_line_length > 0\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n\n        # If it's not the beginning of a line, add a space before the word.\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            wrapped_text *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n\n        wrapped_text *= word\n        current_line_length += length(word)\n    end\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's use an example to see how this function works. We'll pass a sample string to `wrap_string`:\n\n```julia\nsample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(sample_text, 15)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\nJulia is a\nhigh-level,\nhigh-performance\nprogramming\nlanguage for\ntechnical\ncomputing.\n```\n\nIn this output, the text is wrapped so that each line does not exceed 15 characters. The function ensures that words are not split in the middle unless a single word is longer than the specified line width.","status":200,"tokens":[58,405],"elapsed":13.643484083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
