X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Here's how you can write the `wrap_string` function in Julia, adhering to the problem-solving steps:\n\n### Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\nFor this task, I'll need to remember how to:\n\n- Work with strings and arrays in Julia\n- Iterate through words in a string using loops\n- Concatenate strings while checking their lengths\n- Use conditionals to control the flow of the program\n\n### Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        if current_line_length + length(word) <= text_width\n            # If the word fits, add it to the line\n            wrapped_text *= (current_line_length == 0 ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n            current_line_length += length(word) + (current_line_length == 0 ? 0 : 1)\n        else\n            # Otherwise, start a new line and add the word there\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\" * word\n            current_line_length = length(word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check that the solution is correct\nTo ensure the correctness of this solution, we should provide an example to test the `wrap_string` function.\n\n```julia\nexample_text = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.\"\nwrapped_example = wrap_string(example_text)\nprintln(wrapped_example)\n```\n\n### Expected Output\nThe output should wrap the text to a maximum of 10 characters per line. The provided example text has longer words, so expect words to not be split, but rather placed on new lines if they cannot fit on the current line.\n\n**Note**: Word lengths are calculated without considering spaces that separate them, but when printing or adding them to the wrapped text, spaces are considered in line lengths.","status":200,"tokens":[317,407],"elapsed":13.191068292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
