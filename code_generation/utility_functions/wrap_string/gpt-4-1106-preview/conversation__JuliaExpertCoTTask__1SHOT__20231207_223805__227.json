Split the given string into words based on spaces.\n2. Iterate through the list of words and keep track of the current line length.\n3. For each word,\n   - Check if adding this word to the current line would exceed the `text_width`; \n     - If it does, append a newline character to the output and reset the current line length.\n     - If it doesn't, just append the word to the output.\n4. Return the resulting string.\n\nNow let's implement the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)::String\n    words = split(text, ' ')\n    line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            line_length = 0\n        end\n        wrapped_text *= word * \" \"\n        line_length += length(word) + 1\n    end\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\n\nThis function processes a given string and wraps the words based on a maximum text width of 10 characters by default. It will output the string with new lines inserted where necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[128,273],"elapsed":21.637974583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
