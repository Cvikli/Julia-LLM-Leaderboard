Below is the implementation of the `wrap_string` function as per your requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = []\n\n    for word in words\n        if current_line_length + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(wrapped_text, '\\n')\n            current_line_length = 0\n        elseif current_line_length > 0\n            push!(wrapped_text, ' ')\n            current_line_length += 1\n        end\n        push!(wrapped_text, word)\n        current_line_length += length(word)\n    end\n\n    return join(wrapped_text)\nend\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nAssuming that the default `text_width` of 10 is used, the printed output would be a version of `text` where a new line is inserted at appropriate points such that no line exceeds 10 characters. Keep in mind that the exact output would depend on the input string and the specific word lengths.","status":200,"tokens":[93,258],"elapsed":8.684283791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
