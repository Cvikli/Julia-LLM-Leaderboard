Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can provide you with a function that does this in Python. In this function, `wrap_string`, we'll iterate through the words of a given string and add a newline character (`\\n`) when adding the next word would exceed the maximum `text_width`.\n\nBelow is the Python function:\n\n```python\ndef wrap_string(text, text_width=10):\n    words = text.split()\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n\n    for word in words:\n        # If adding the word exceeds the text_width, move to the next line\n        if current_line_length + len(word) > text_width:\n            wrapped_text += \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n\n        # Add the word to the current line\n        wrapped_text += word\n        current_line_length += len(word)\n\n        # If this isn't the end of the input, add a space unless it's the end of the line\n        if len(wrapped_text) < len(text):\n            if current_line_length < text_width:\n                wrapped_text += \" \"\n                current_line_length += 1\n            else:\n                # Start a new line if the next word doesn't fit.\n                wrapped_text += \"\\n\"\n                current_line_length = 0\n\n    return wrapped_text\n\n# Example usage\nexample_text = \"This is an example of a string that we want to wrap accordingly.\"\nprint(wrap_string(example_text))\n```\n\nThis function will take the `example_text` string and insert a newline instead of a space when the next word would make the line exceed the specified `text_width`. Note that I wrote this function assuming the input contains only spaces and wordsâ€”no existing newlines or other whitespace characters.\n\nAn important consideration to make while implementing a word-wrapping function is how to handle words that are themselves longer than `text_width`. The function above does not split individual words; it only wraps between them. If you have words that exceed `text_width`, you will need to adjust the function to handle such cases accordingly, possibly by breaking the long word across lines.","status":200,"tokens":[55,425],"elapsed":15.16610875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
