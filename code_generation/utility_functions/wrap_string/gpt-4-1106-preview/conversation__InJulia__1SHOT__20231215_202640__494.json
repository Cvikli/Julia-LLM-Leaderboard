Below is a Julia function named `wrap_string` that takes a string and wraps the text so that each line does not exceed the specified `text_width`. If `text_width` is not provided, it defaults to 10 characters.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(str)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # Check if adding the next word would exceed the line width\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            # Start a new line if the word would exceed the line width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        # Add a space before the word if it's not the beginning of a line\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            wrapped_text *= \" \"\n            current_line_length += 1  # Account for the space\n        end\n        wrapped_text *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length\n    end\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided example, it will output the string with new lines inserted so that no line is longer than 10 characters:\n\n```\nThe quick\nbrown fox\njumps over\nthe lazy\ndog\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this function does not break words. If a single word is longer than `text_width`, it will be placed on a new line but will not be split into smaller parts. If you need to handle longer words, you would need to modify the function to include additional logic to split words that exceed the `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[58,380],"elapsed":48.739550916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
