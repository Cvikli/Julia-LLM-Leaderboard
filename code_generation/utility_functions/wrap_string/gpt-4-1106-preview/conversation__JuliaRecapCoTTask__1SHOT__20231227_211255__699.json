[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"We can achieve the task by creating a Julia function named `wrap_string` that iterates over individual words in a given string, keeping track of the current line length, and inserting line breaks (`\\n`) appropriately. The function will need to handle cases where a single word is longer than the maximum text width by wrapping that word onto a new line.\n\nHere is the function definition along with an example usage:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n\n        # If the word itself exceeds text_width, put it in a new line.\n        if word_length > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\" * word * \" \"\n            current_line_length = word_length + 1  # plus one for the space\n        elseif current_line_length + word_length <= text_width\n            wrapped_text *= word * \" \"\n            current_line_length += word_length + 1\n        else\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\" * word * \" \"\n            current_line_length = word_length + 1\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Remove trailing whitespace\n    return strip(wrapped_text)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nprintln(wrap_string(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", 10))\n```\n\nWhen running the example, the word `jumps` which is longer than 10 characters alone will appear on a new line. The function divides the text at spaces and then reconstructs the string respecting the `text_width` parameter, taking into account the length of current line and the length of the upcoming word to decide whether a new line character should be inserted or not.","status":200,"tokens":[317,365],"elapsed":32.130358208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
