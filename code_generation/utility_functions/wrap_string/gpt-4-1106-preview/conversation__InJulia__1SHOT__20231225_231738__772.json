Provide an example","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write a function `wrap_string` that iterates over words and adds a newline character each time the maximum `text_width` is exceeded as such:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(s)\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if current_line != \"\"\n                current_line *= \" \"\n            end\n            current_line *= word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if current_line != \"\"\n        wrapped_text *= current_line\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\nLet's go through this function briefly:\n\n1. We start by splitting the string `s` into words.\n2. We initialize `current_line` to an empty string that will hold the words that fit within the current line without exceeding `text_width`.\n3. We initialize `wrapped_text` to an empty string that will eventually become our final, wrapped string output.\n4. We then iterate through each word in `words`.\n5. Within our loop, for every word, we check if adding the word to the current line would exceed our `text_width` limit. We add one to the length to account for the space between words.\n6. If adding the word would exceed the limit, we add the `current_line` to our `wrapped_text` and start a new line with the current word.\n7. Otherwise, if the current line is not empty, we add a space followed by the word to the `current_line`.\n8. After all words have been processed, if the `current_line` isn't empty, we add it to the `wrapped_text`.\n\nHere is an example of using the `wrap_string` function:\n\n```julia\nexample_text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nwrapped = wrap_string(example_text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped)\n```\n\nThis should output the `example_text` with newlines inserted when a line exceeds 10 characters:\n\n```\nThe quick\nbrown fox\njumps over\nthe lazy\ndog\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this function will not split a single long word that exceeds the `text_width`. So if you have a word that's longer than the `text_width`, it will appear on its own line without wrapping.","status":200,"tokens":[58,512],"elapsed":20.122820209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
