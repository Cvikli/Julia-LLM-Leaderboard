Below is an example of a `wrap_string` function written in Python. This function takes a string and a maximum text width (defaulting to 10 characters) and inserts a newline character (`\\n`) to ensure that each line does not exceed the specified width.\n\n```python\ndef wrap_string(text, text_width=10):\n    words = text.split()\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if adding the next word would exceed the line width\n        if len(current_line) + len(word) + 1 > text_width:\n            # Add the current line to the wrapped text and reset the current line\n            wrapped_text += current_line.rstrip() + \"\\n\"\n            current_line = \"\"\n\n        # Add the word to the current line\n        current_line += word + \" \"\n\n    # Add the last line to the wrapped text\n    wrapped_text += current_line.rstrip()\n\n    return wrapped_text\n\n# Example usage:\nexample_text = \"This is an example of a string that we want to wrap after a certain number of characters.\"\nwrapped = wrap_string(example_text)\nprint(wrapped)\n```\n\nWhen you run this function with the provided example text, it will output the text with new lines inserted so that no line is longer than 10 characters, if possible. Note that this simple function does not break words; it only wraps on spaces, so some lines may be shorter than the maximum if the next word would cause it to exceed the limit.\n\nHere's what the output might look like:\n\n```\nThis is an\nexample of\na string\nthat we\nwant to\nwrap after\na certain\nnumber of\ncharacters.\n```\n\nKeep in mind that this function does not handle very long words that exceed the `text_width` on their own. If you need to handle such cases, you would need to modify the function to break long words as well.","status":200,"tokens":[55,393],"elapsed":34.4045805,"_type":"aimessage"}]
