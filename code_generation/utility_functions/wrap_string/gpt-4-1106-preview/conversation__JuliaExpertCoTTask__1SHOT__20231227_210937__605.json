Create a function `wrap_string` that takes a string as input and a `text_width` with a default value of 10.\n2. Tokenize the input string into words by splitting on spaces.\n3. Initialize an empty string `result` to collect the wrapped text.\n4. Iterate over the words and keep track of the current line length.\n5. For each word, check if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum text width.\n6. If it would, append a newline to `result` and reset the current line length.\n7. Add the current word to `result`.\n8. After processing all words, return the `result` string.\n9. Provide an example by calling `wrap_string` with the given data.\n\n## Step 2-8: Writing the function\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input_str)\n    result = \"\"\n    current_line_length = 0\n    \n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            result *= \"\\n\"  # Add a newline character\n            current_line_length = 0\n        end\n        if current_line_length > 0\n            result *= \" \"  # Add a space before the word if it's not the start of a line\n        end\n        result *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length + (current_line_length > 0 ? 1 : 0)  # Add one for the space if not the first word\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\n## Step 9: Example\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\noutput = wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")\nprintln(output)\n```\n\nRunning the above code would output the string with lines wrapped according to the maximum width defined.","status":200,"tokens":[162,392],"elapsed":21.445165959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
