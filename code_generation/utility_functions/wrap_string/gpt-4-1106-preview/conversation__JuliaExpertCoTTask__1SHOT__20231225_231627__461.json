When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Think through your approach step by step\n\n1. Define a function `wrap_string` that takes two arguments: the string to wrap, and an optional maximum text width with a default value of 10.\n2. Split the input string into words using space as the delimiter.\n3. Initialize an empty string to collect the wrapped text.\n4. Iterate over the words, and for each word, check whether adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum `text_width`.\n5. If the new word does not exceed the `text_width`, add it to the current line.\n6. If the new word does exceed `text_width`, add a newline character to the collected text before adding the word to start a new line.\n7. After iterating through all words, return the wrapped text.\n\n## Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + (current_line == \"\" ? 0 : 1) > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= (wrapped_text == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * current_line\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            current_line *= (current_line == \"\" ? \"\" : \" \") * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    wrapped_text *= (wrapped_text == \"\" ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * current_line\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Solve the Task\n\n```julia\n# We'll use the provided example to solve the task and output the result\nexample_text = \"This function will wrap words into lines\"\nwrapped_example = wrap_string(example_text)\nprintln(wrapped_example)\n```\n\n## Step 4: Check that your solution is correct\n\nAfter running the code using the provided example, the expected output should be a wrapped version of the input text, respecting the default max text width of 10 characters. We will check this manually:\n```\nThis\nfunction\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```\n\nNow, let's put all these steps into action.","status":200,"tokens":[162,461],"elapsed":13.98780125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
