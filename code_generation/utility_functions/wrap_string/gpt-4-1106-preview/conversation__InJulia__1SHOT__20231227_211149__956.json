Below is a Julia function named `wrap_string` that takes a string and wraps it so that each line does not exceed the given `text_width`. By default, the `text_width` is set to 10 characters.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # Check if adding the next word would exceed the line width\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"  # Start a new line\n            wrapped_text *= word  # Add the word to the new line\n            current_line_length = word_length + 1  # +1 for the space\n        else\n            # If this is not the first word of the line, prepend a space\n            if current_line_length > 0 \n                wrapped_text *= \" \"\n                current_line_length += 1  # Account for the space\n            end\n            wrapped_text *= word\n            current_line_length += word_length\n        end\n    end\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example usage of wrap_string\ntext = \"This is an example sentence that we want to wrap after a certain length.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, 10)\nprintln(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nPlease note that the function simply adds each word to a current line until the line reaches or exceeds `text_width` characters. Once this happens, it starts a new line with the next word. This function does not handle cases where a single word is longer than the `text_width`â€”it will put the word on a new line, which could exceed the specified width.\n\nHere's an example output if we run the provided script:\n\n```\nThis is an\nexample\nsentence\nthat we\nwant to\nwrap after\na certain\nlength.\n```\n\nIn the above example, every line is wrapped so that it doesn't exceed 10 characters if possible, taking into account the spaces between words.","status":200,"tokens":[58,433],"elapsed":42.185601042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
