For each word in the input string, I'll check if adding it to the current line would exceed the maximum text width. If it would, I'll insert a newline character before the word. Otherwise, I'll add the word to the current line. I'll do this by keeping track of the current line length.\n\n# Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    current_line = \"\"\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        # Check if adding this word would exceed the text width\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width  # +1 for space\n            wrapped_text *= current_line * \"\\n\"\n            current_line = word\n        else\n            if length(current_line) > 0\n                current_line *= \" \" * word\n            else\n                current_line = word\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if length(current_line) > 0\n        wrapped_text *= current_line\n    end\n    \n    return wrapped_text\nend\n```\n\n# Step 3: Solve the task\nUsing the `wrap_string` function with \"This function will wrap words into lines\".\n\n# Step 4: Check that your solution is correct\nCreate an example output to verify that the function is wrapping lines correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[162,335],"elapsed":18.029094708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
