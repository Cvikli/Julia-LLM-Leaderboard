[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`. It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish this task, I will write a function `wrap_string` that takes two parameters: a string `text`, and an optional integer `text_width` that defaults to 10. The function will work as follows:\n\n1. Split the input `text` string into words.\n2. Iterate over words, keeping track of the length of the current line.\n3. Add each word to the current line as long as adding that word won't exceed the `text_width`. If adding the word would exceed the `text_width`, it will add a newline character before the word.\n4. Join all the words with spaces or new lines as needed.\n\nHere is the function followed by an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text)\n    current_line_length = 0\n    wrapped_text = \"\"\n\n    for word in words\n        word_length = length(word)\n        # Check whether adding this word would exceed the line width\n        if current_line_length + word_length > text_width\n            # Add a new line if the word isn't the first on the line\n            if current_line_length > 0\n                wrapped_text *= \"\\n\"\n            end\n            current_line_length = 0\n        elseif current_line_length != 0\n            # Add a space before the word if it's not at the beginning of a line\n            wrapped_text *= \" \"\n        end\n\n        # Add the current word and update the line length\n        wrapped_text *= word\n        current_line_length += word_length + 1 # Add 1 for the space or newline\n    end\n\n    return wrapped_text\nend\n\n# Example:\nexample_text = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nwrapped_example = wrap_string(example_text)\nprintln(\"Wrapped Text:\\n$wrapped_example\")\n```\n\nThis will give a result that has each line of the text not exceeding the default `text_width` of 10 characters. The spaces between words are counted as a single character when considering the line length.","status":200,"tokens":[316,423],"elapsed":48.271277667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
