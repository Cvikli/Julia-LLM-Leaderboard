It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by writing a function called `wrap_string` that takes two arguments: `input_str::String` and `text_width::Int=10`. The function will iterate over the words in `input_str`, add them to a line while keeping track of the current length, and move on to the next line when `text_width` is exceeded.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input_str::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input_str, \" \")\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 > text_width #+1 to account for the space\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        \n        if current_line == \"\"\n            current_line *= word\n        else\n            current_line *= \" \" * word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    push!(lines, current_line) # append the last line\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test our function with an example:\n\n```julia\ninput_str = \"This function will wrap words into lines when exceeding the maximum text width\"\nprintln(wrap_string(input_str))\n```\n\nThe output should be a string where each line doesn't exceed `text_width`.","status":200,"tokens":[196,341],"elapsed":48.438296459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
