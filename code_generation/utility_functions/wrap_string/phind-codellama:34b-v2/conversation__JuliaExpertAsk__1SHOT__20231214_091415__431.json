Here's a possible implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str, text_width)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    wrapped_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if length(word) > text_width\n            wrapped_word = word * (\"\\n\" * (text_width - length(word)))\n            wrapped_words = [wrapped_word]append!(wrapped_words, word)\n        else\n            wrapped_words = [word]append!(wrapped_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return joined(wrapped_words, \"\")\nend\n```\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\nstr = \"This is a very long string that needs to be wrapped at 10 words per line.\"\ntext_width = 10\nwrapped_string = wrap_string(str, text_width)\nprintln(wrapped_string)\n```\nThe output would be:\n```\nThis is a very long string that needs to be wrapped at 10 words per line.\n\nThis is a very long string that needs to be wrapped at 10 words per line.\n```\nNote that the `join` function is used to concatenate the wrapped words into a single string.","status":200,"tokens":[94,306],"elapsed":10.433320667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
