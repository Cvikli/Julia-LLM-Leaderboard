If adding a new word to the current line would exceed `text_width`, a new line is started. The function returns the text wrapped in this way as a single string with newline characters separating lines.\n\nExample:\n\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\", 10)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThis function\nwill wrap\nwords into\nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[196,249],"elapsed":56.60440725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
