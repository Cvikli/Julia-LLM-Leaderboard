It checks for each word if adding it to the current line would exceed `text_width`. If it does, the word is pushed to a new line.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(str::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(str)\n    lines = String[]\n    current_line = \"\"\n    \n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= \" \" * word\n    end\n    push!(lines, current_line) # Push the remaining words in the last line\n    \n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nLet's test it with an example:\n\n```julia\nstr = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus eget.\"\nprint(wrap_string(str, 10))\n```\n\nThis will print the text `str` with a maximum of `10` characters per line. If a word is longer than `10` characters it will be placed on its own line.","status":200,"tokens":[76,290],"elapsed":38.335168834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
