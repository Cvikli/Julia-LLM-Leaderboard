Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Based on the given information, I will approach the problem using a systematic approach to solving problems. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nStep 1: Recall Julia Snippets (5 minutes)\n\nI will quickly review the Julia language syntax and key features that may be useful for this task. This includes variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`, functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task (20 minutes)\n\nI will write a function `wrap_string` that takes a string as input and iterates over its words, adding a new line each time the maximum text width `text_width::Int=10` is exceeded. Here's an example of how the function might look like:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    for word in words\n        if length(word) > text_width\n            println()\n            print(word)\n        else\n            println(word)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-check the Solution (5 minutes)\n\nI will double-check the solution by testing it with a few examples to ensure that it works correctly. For instance, I will call the function `wrap_string(\"This is a sample string\")` and verify that it prints the words on separate lines as expected.\n\nStep 4: Provide an Example (5 minutes)\n\nAs per your special instructions, I will provide an example of how to use the `wrap_string` function. Here's an example:\n```julia\nwrap_string(\"This is a longer string that exceeds the text width\")\n```\nThis should print the words on separate lines as needed.\n\nTotal Time: 50 minutes","status":200,"tokens":[11,500],"elapsed":18.314142042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
