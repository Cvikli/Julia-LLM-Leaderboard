Define the function `wrap_string` with two parameters: the input string and the maximum text width.\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the wrapped words.\n3. Split the input string into words.\n4. Iterate over the words, and for each word:\n   a. Check if adding the word to the current line would exceed the maximum text width.\n   b. If it does not exceed, add the word to the current line.\n   c. Otherwise, add the current line (if not empty) to the list of wrapped words, and start a new line with the current word.\n5. After iterating over all words, add the last line (if not empty) to the list of wrapped words.\n6. Join the list of wrapped words into a single string, with newlines between each word.\n7. Return the resulting string.\n\n# Example\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    # Step 2: Initialize an empty list to store the wrapped words\n    wrapped_words = []\n    \n    # Step 3: Split the input string into words\n    words = split(input)\n    \n    # Step 4: Iterate over the words and wrap them as needed\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line) + length(word) + 1 <= text_width\n            current_line *= \" \" * (length(current_line) % text_width == 0 ? text_width : length(current_line) % text_width + text_width)\n            current_line *= word * (length(word) % text_width == 0 ? text_width : length(word) % text_width + text_width)\n        else\n            if !isempty(current_line)\n                push!(wrapped_words, current_line)\n            end\n            current_line = word\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Step 5: Add the last line (if not empty) to the list of wrapped words\n    if !isempty(current_line)\n        push!(wrapped_words, current_line)\n    end\n    \n    # Step 6: Join the list of wrapped words into a single string, with newlines between each word\n    return join(map(word -> replace(word, r\"\\n\" => \"\\n\"), wrapped_words), \"\\n\")\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided example\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[191,581],"elapsed":30.20011075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
