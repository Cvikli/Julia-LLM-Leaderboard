The `text_width` variable is set to 10, which means that any line of output will be at most 10 characters long.\n\nThe function first splits the input string into individual words using the `split` function with a space as the separator. It then iterates over each word and checks if it exceeds the text width by adding it to the current line. If it does, a new line is added to the output array using `push!(lines, \"\")`. Then, the word is appended to the current line using `push!(lines[end], word * \" \")`, where `lines[end]` refers to the last element in the array.\n\nFinally, the function joins the output array into a single string using the `join` function with a newline (`\\n`) as the separator. This produces the wrapped version of the input string that can be printed or stored in a file.","status":200,"tokens":[193,368],"elapsed":7.772953252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
