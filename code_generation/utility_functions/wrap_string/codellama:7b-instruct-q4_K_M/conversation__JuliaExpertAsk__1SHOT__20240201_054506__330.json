If the `text_width` is not provided, it defaults to 10. The function first splits the input string into individual words using `split`. Then, it iterates over each word in the array of words. For each word, it checks if the length of the current line plus the length of the word exceeds the `text_width`. If so, a new line is created and the word is added to it. Otherwise, the word is appended to the current line. Finally, the function returns the joined lines with newlines between them using `join`.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> wrap_string(\"This is a very long string that needs to be wrapped.\", 10)\n\"This is a\\nvery long\\nstring that\\nneeds to be\\nwrapped.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.514137727,"_type":"aimessage"}]
