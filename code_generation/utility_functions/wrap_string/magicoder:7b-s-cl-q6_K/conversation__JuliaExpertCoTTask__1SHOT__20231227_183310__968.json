We'll use a simple while loop to iterate over the words in the text:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    result = String[]\n\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(current_line * \" $word\") > text_width\n            push!(result, current_line)\n            current_line = \"\"\n        end\n        current_line *= \" $word\"\n    end\n\n    # Add the remaining line\n    push!(result, current_line)\n\n    return join(result, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\nYou can test this function with your example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(wrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\"))\n```\nThis should print:\n\n```\nThis \nfunction \nwill \nwrap \nwords \ninto \nlines\n```","status":200,"tokens":[185,257],"elapsed":13.959806125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
