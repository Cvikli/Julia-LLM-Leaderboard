The function splits the string into words and iterates over them, keeping track of the current line and the current width. When the width of the current line plus the width of the next word would exceed the maximum width, the function adds a newline character and resets the current line and width. The function returns the wrapped string as a single string with newline characters inserted at the appropriate places.","status":200,"tokens":[102,428],"elapsed":9.521210458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
