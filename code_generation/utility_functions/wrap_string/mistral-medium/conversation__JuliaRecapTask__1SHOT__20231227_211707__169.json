[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

The function `wrap_string` takes a string `text` and an optional argument `text_width` as input.\n2. It splits the input text into words using the `split` function and initializes an empty vector `lines` to store the lines of the wrapped text.\n3. It then iterates over the words and checks if the length of the current line plus the length of the current word (plus one for the space) exceeds the maximum text width.\n4. If the maximum width is exceeded, it pushes the current line to the `lines` vector and resets the `current_line` variable to an empty string.\n5. If the maximum width is not exceeded, it appends the current word to the `current_line` variable.\n6. Once all the words have been processed, it pushes the last line to the `lines` vector and joins the lines using the `join` function with a newline character as the separator.\n7. Finally, it returns the wrapped text as a string.\n\nNote: The function uses the type `AbstractString` to allow for inputs of type `String` or `SubString` and the type `Vector{AbstractString}` to allow for a vector of strings or substrings. This makes the function more flexible and allows for more use cases.","status":200,"tokens":[362,475],"elapsed":10.904204042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
