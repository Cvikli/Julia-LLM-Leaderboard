Below is an example of a `wrap_string` function written in Python that does what you've described:\n\n```python\ndef wrap_string(text, text_width=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    Wrap the given string at 'text_width' columns.\n    If the width is exceeded, it will add a new line.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the text into individual lines based on newlines and spaces that exceed the limit\n    lines = text.split('\\n')\n    for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n        line = line.rstrip()  # Remove trailing whitespace\n        words = line.split()\n        if len(words) == 0:\n            continue  # Skip empty lines\n        current_width = sum(len(word) for word in words) + (len(words) - 1)  # Calculate current line width including spaces\n        if current_width <= text_width:\n            # If the line is shorter than the limit, add it as-is\n            yield line\n            continue\n        # Find the first space that exceeds the limit and wrap there\n        for j, word in enumerate(words):\n            if current_width + len(word) > text_width:\n                # Wrap at this word\n                if j == 0:\n                    # If it's the first word, just yield it with a new line\n                    yield ' '.join(words[:j]) + '\\n'\n                else:\n                    # Otherwise, yield everything before and including this word with a new line\n                    yield ' '.join(words[:j]) + ' ' + words[j]  # Add space if not at start of line\n                # Advance to the next word\n                j += 1\n                break\n        else:\n            # If we didn't break, then all words fit within the limit\n            yield line\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"This is a very long string that will be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_lines = wrap_string(text)\nfor line in wrapped_lines:\n    print(line)\n```\n\nThis function takes a `text` parameter and an optional `text_width` parameter. It splits the text into words, calculates the width of each line, and wraps the string at the first space that exceeds the specified limit. If no spaces exceed the limit, the entire line is yielded without wrapping. The function returns an iterable of wrapped lines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input text does not contain any leading or trailing whitespace that needs to be preserved. It also does not account for non-breaking characters (e.g., `&nbsp;`) or complex line breaking rules (like those used in bidirectional text). For simplicity, it treats all spaces as potential breakpoints.","status":200,"tokens":[62,624],"elapsed":84.148273042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
