I'll write the function `wrap_string` in Python, as it is a programming language that many people are familiar with. The function will accept a `text_width` parameter and will wrap the text at the specified width.\n\n```python\ndef wrap_string(text: str, text_width: int = 10):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to wrap a string at 'text_width' characters per line.\n    If the text does not exceed 'text_width' characters, it will be returned as is.\n    \"\"\"\n    lines = []\n    words = text.split()\n    current_line = \"\"\n    for word in words:\n        if len(current_line) + len(word) > text_width:\n            # We have to wrap to a new line\n            lines.append(current_line)\n            current_line = word\n        else:\n            # Append the word to the current line\n            current_line += f\" {word}\"\n    # Append the last bit of the current line\n    if current_line != \"\":\n        lines.append(current_line)\n    return lines\n\n\n# Example usage:\ntext = \"Hello there, this is a very long string that will be wrapped into multiple lines.\"\nwrapped_text = wrap_string(text, text_width=20)\nprint(wrapped_text)\n```\n\nThis function splits the text into words and then builds an array of lines, adding a new line each time the current line would exceed the specified `text_width`. If a word fits on the current line without exceeding the width, it is appended to the current line's string. Once a word exceeds the width or if the line is ended, the function appends the current line to the list of lines and starts a new one.\n\nPlease note that this example uses Python 3 syntax, which may look slightly different from other programming languages. The `text_width` parameter has a default value of 10, but you can change it to any positive integer to adjust the width at which wrapping occurs.","status":200,"tokens":[62,469],"elapsed":62.915234167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
