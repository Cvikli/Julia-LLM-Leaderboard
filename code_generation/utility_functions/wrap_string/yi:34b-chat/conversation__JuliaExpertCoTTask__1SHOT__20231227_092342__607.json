It then iterates over these words and checks if the length of the current word, when added to the current line (which is initially an empty string), would exceed the `text_width`. If it does, a new line is started. After processing all words, the lines are returned as a vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[184,200],"elapsed":51.804297459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
