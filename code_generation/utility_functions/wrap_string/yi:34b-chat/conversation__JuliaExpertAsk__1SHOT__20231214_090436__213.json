Here is a possible implementation of the `wrap_string` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction wrap_string(str, text_width)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    length = length(words)\n    for i = 1:length-1\n        if length(words[i]) > text_width\n            words[i] = words[i]...\"\\n\"\n    end\n    return join(words, \"\")\nend\n```\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\njulia> str = \"This is a very long string that exceeds the maximum width of 10 characters.\"\n\"This is a very long string that exceeds the maximum width of 10 characters.\"\n\njulia> wrapped_str = wrap_string(str, 10)\n\"This is a very long string that exceeds the maximum width of 10 characters.\"\n\"This is a very long string that exceeds the maximum width of 10 characters.\"\n```\nAs you can see, the function splits the input string into words, and then iteratively adds a new line character (`\\n`) to each word when the length of the word exceeds the specified `text_width`. The resulting wrapped string is returned as a concatenation of the individual words.","status":200,"tokens":[94,291],"elapsed":9.967739833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
