[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

This function, `wrap_string`, takes in an input string and iteratively breaks it into chunks of text that are no longer than a specified width (`text_width::Int=10`).\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(s::AbstractString; text_width::Int = 10)\n    words = split(s, \" \")\n    line = \"\"\n    lines = String[]\n\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" \" * word) > text_width\n            push!(lines, line)\n            line = \"\"\n        end\n        line *= \" \" * word \n    end\n\n    # Add the last line as it hasn't been added yet\n    if !isempty(line)\n        push!(lines, line)\n    end\n\n    return join(lines, \"\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nAn example usage:\n```julia\ns = \"This is a test string with several words in it. It should be wrapped as it gets too long.\"\nprint(wrap_string(s))\n```\n\nThis code first splits the input `AbstractString` into an array of words, then iteratively concatenates each word to the current line. If adding a new word would cause the line's length to exceed the `text_width`, it pushes the current line onto the lines array and starts a fresh line. After all words are processed, it pushes the last line into the array if it is not empty (this can happen if the string ends with whitespace). Finally, it joins the lines together with newline characters to return the final string.","status":200,"tokens":[365,362],"elapsed":13.008560375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
