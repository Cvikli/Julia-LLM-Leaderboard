It iterates over words and it will add a new line each time a maximum `text_width::Int=10` would be exceeded. Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(text, ' ')\n    result = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words \n        if length(line * \" \"$word) <= text_width \n            push!(line, \" $word\")\n        else\n            result *= \"\\n$line\"\n            line = \" $word\"\n        end\n    end\n    result *= \"\\n$line\"   # add the last line without newline character at the end.\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\n```julia\ntext = \"This is a very long sentence that needs to be wrapped.\"\nprintln(wrap_string(text, 15))\n```\n\nIn this example, each word will be added to the current line if adding the new word would cause the line length to exceed `text_width`, otherwise, a newline character followed by the current line is added to the result and the new word is added to a new line. The function then returns the final result string. \n\nAs a side note, this approach is very simple and does not take into account punctuation or other potential complications in text formatting. For more complex wrapping needs, you might need to use a different approach such as creating a parser that can recognize and handle special cases correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[104,315],"elapsed":10.007514584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
