We then split the text into individual words and check their length against the desired line width. If adding a new word would exceed the maximum width, we start a new line by appending a newline character to our result string. Otherwise, we simply append a space. Lastly, we return the resulting string of lines.\n\nThe function is then tested with an example string \"This function will wrap words into lines\". The output is printed on the console.","status":200,"tokens":[185,299],"elapsed":15.48519575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
