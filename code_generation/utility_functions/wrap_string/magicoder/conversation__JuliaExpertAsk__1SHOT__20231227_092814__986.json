Provide an example","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Julia function that does this:\n\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(input::String, text_width::Int=10)\n    words = split(input, \" \")\n    output = \"\"\n    line = \"\"\n    for word in words\n        if length(line * \" \" * word) <= text_width\n            push!(line, word * \" \")\n        else \n            output *= \"$line\\n\"\n            line = String[]\n            push!(line, word * \" \")\n        end\n    end\n    return output * join(line, \"\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input string into an array of words. It then iterates over each word, checking if adding it to the current line would cause it to exceed the `text_width`. If it wouldn't, it adds the word to the end of the line with a space in between. If it would, it appends the line to the output string and starts a new line with just this word. The process is repeated until all words have been added to lines, which are then concatenated together into a final result.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nprint(wrap_string(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"))\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nThe quick \nbrown fox \njumps over \nthe lazy dog\n```","status":200,"tokens":[104,315],"elapsed":9.810625334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
