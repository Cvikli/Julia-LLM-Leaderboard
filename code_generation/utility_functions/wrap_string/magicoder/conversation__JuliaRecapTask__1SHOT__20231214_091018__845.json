Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Based on the problem statement and guidelines provided, here are the steps I will follow to solve the task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* `for` loop\n\t* `if-elseif-else` statements\n\t* Array slicing and indexing\n\t* Tuples and namedtuples\n\t* Dictionaries\n\t* String interpolation with `$`\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Create a function `wrap_string` that takes a string as input and iterates over its words.\n\t* For each word, check if the length of the word exceeds the maximum allowed width `text_width`.\n\t* If the word length exceeds the maximum width, add a new line and start a new word.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with different input strings and verify that it produces the expected output.\n\nHere's the implemented function `wrap_string`:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::AbstractString, text_width::Int=10)\n    for word in StringTokenize(text)\n        if length(word) > text_width\n            println()\n            word = word[:word.length-1] # trim the excess word character\n        end\n        yield word\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two inputs: `text` (the string to wrap), and `text_width` (the maximum width allowed for each word).\n* We use the `StringTokenize` function to split the input string into an array of words.\n* We then iterate over the array of words using the `yield` keyword, which allows us to generate the output iteratively.\n* For each word, we check if its length exceeds the maximum width allowed. If it does, we add a new line and start a new word.\n* Finally, we trim the excess character from the last word if necessary.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to see any examples or if you have any questions!","status":200,"tokens":[365,472],"elapsed":20.30922875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
