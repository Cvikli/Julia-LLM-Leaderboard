Here's the solution to the task using the given approach:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Think through your approach step by step:\n\t* Identify the problem: wrapping a long string into multiple lines when the width exceeds a certain limit.\n\t* Determine the input and output requirements: a string to wrap, a maximum text width, and the desired number of lines to create.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\t* Define a function `wrap_string(text: String, width: Int = 10)` that takes a string and a maximum text width as input and returns a wrapped string with the desired number of lines.\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Create a list of words in the input string using the `split` function.\n\t* Iterate over the words, checking each one's length to see if it exceeds the maximum text width. If it does, create a new line and add the word to it. Otherwise, add the word to the current line.\n\t* Once all words are wrapped, return the list of lines as the output.\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with various input strings and maximum widths to ensure it produces the expected results.\n\nHere's an example implementation of `wrap_string`:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, width::Int = 10)\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = split(text, \" \")\n    \n    # Create a list of lines to wrap the words in\n    lines = [[]]\n    \n    # Iterate over each word and wrap it if necessary\n    for word in words\n        if length(word) > width\n            push!(lines, word)\n            lines = [lines[1]] + lines[2:]\n        else\n            push!(lines, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the list of lines as the wrapped string\n    return lines\nend\n\n# Test the function with various inputs and widths\nwrap_string(\"This function will wrap words into lines\") # Should produce [\"This\", \"function\", \"will\", \"wrap\", \"words\", \"into\", \"lines\"]\nwrap_string(\"This is a very long string to wrap\") # Should produce [\"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"very\", \"long\", \"string\", \"to\", \"wrap\"]\n```\nI hope this helps!
