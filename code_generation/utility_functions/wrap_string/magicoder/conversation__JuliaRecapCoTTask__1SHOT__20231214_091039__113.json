Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Based on the given information, here's my systematic approach to solving the problem:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* Iterating over a sequence (e.g., words in a string) using `each` or `for`.\n\t* Creating a new line using `println` or `writes`.\n\t* Checking the length of a string using `length`.\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Create a function `wrap_string(text, width)` that iterates over the words in a string `text`, and for each word that exceeds the maximum allowed width `width`, adds a new line and continues to the next word.\n\t* Use `each` to iterate over the words in the string.\n\t* Check if the current word exceeds the maximum width using `length`.\n\t* If it does, add a new line using `println` or `writes`, and continue to the next word.\n\t* Repeat this process until all words have been processed.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with a variety of inputs to ensure it produces the expected output.\n\t* Use the `show` function to display the result of the function and verify that it wraps the string correctly.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `wrap_string` function:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text, width)\n    for word in String(text)[:each]\n        if length(word) > width\n            println(\"New line\")\n            continue\n        end\n        yield word\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwrap_string(\"This is a very long string that exceeds the maximum width\", 10)\n```\nIn this implementation, we use `String` to convert the input string to an array of words, and then iterate over each word using the `each` method. We check the length of each word and wrap it to a new line if it exceeds the maximum width. Finally, we yield each word back to the caller using the `yield` keyword.\n\nNote that I've used `for` instead of `if-elseif-else` control structure because it is more concise and expressive in this case. Also, I've used `Continue` statement instead of `break` or `next` to avoid any unintended behavior.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[11,560],"elapsed":20.70421125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
