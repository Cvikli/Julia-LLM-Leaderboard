If adding the current word to the current line would exceed the maximum line length, it adds a newline and starts a new line. It also adds a space between words unless it's the beginning of a line. The result is returned as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[62,369],"elapsed":5.041415834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
