Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `wrap_string`.

Based on the problem statement and the guidelines provided, here's my systematic approach to solving the problem:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Iterating over a sequence (e.g., words in a string): `for word in str`\n\t* Checking if a variable is within a certain range: `if x < 10 && x > -10`\n\t* Creating an anonymous function: `x -> x^2`\n\t* Creating a named tuple: `(; name=\"Julia\")`\n\t* Using the `$` symbol for string interpolation: `\"Hello, \" $ name`\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Write a function `wrap_string(text::String, width::Int=10)` that iterates over the words in a given string and adds a new line each time the maximum width is exceeded.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the function correctly wraps the text at the specified width by calling it with a test string and checking the resulting lines.\n\nHere's the implemented `wrap_string` function:\n```julia\nfunction wrap_string(text::String, width::Int=10)\n    for word in split(text, \" \")\n        if length(word) > width\n            print(\" newline\")\n            word = \"$word\\n\"\n        end\n        print(word)\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `split` function is used to split the input string into an array of words.\n* The loop iterates over each word in the array, using the `if` statement to check if the length of the current word exceeds the specified width. If it does, it adds a new line (`print(\"newline\")` and then concatenates the word with an newline character (`$word\\n`). Otherwise, it simply prints the word without any additional lines.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on the solution!","status":200,"tokens":[365,466],"elapsed":20.067662041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
