Define a function `pig_latinify_word(word)` that takes a single word as input and returns the pig latin version of the word.\n2. Inside the `pig_latinify_word` function, check if the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). If it does, simply add \"ay\" to the end of the word and return the result.\n3. If the word starts with a consonant, find the index of the first vowel in the word.\n4. Slice the word from the first vowel index to the end of the word, then add the sliced part, the consonant cluster at the beginning of the word, and \"ay\" to get the pig latin version of the word.\n5. In the `pig_latinify` function, create an empty vector called `results` to store the pig latin versions of the words.\n6. Use the `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over each word in the input vector and transform it to pig latin in parallel.\n7. Inside the loop, call the `pig_latinify_word` function for each word and append the result to the `results` vector.\n8. Return the `results` vector containing the pig latin versions of the input words.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if isempty(word)\n        return word\n    elseif word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        for (i, char) in enumerate(word)\n            if char in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n        # If no vowels found, return the original word\n        return word\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    results = Vector{AbstractString}()\n    \n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        pig_latin_word = pig_latinify_word(word)\n        push!(results, pig_latin_word)\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function using the provided example:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n4-element Vector{AbstractString}:\n \"ellohay\"\n \"appleay\"\n \"ongstray\"\n \"orldway\"\n```\n\nThe implementation should return a vector of strings with the pig latin versions of the input words.","status":200,"tokens":[170,565],"elapsed":9.518670334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
