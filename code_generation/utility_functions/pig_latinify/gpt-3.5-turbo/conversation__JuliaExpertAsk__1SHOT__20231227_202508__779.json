The `pig_latinify_word` function is used internally by `pig_latinify` and converts an individual word to pig latin based on the rules of the game.\n\nThe `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop, allowing each iteration to run on a separate thread for improved performance.","status":200,"tokens":[97,283],"elapsed":5.160328916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
