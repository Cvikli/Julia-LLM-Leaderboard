X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define a function `pig_latinify_word(word)` that transforms a single word to pig latin.\n2. Iterate over the vector of strings using a `@threads` loop.\n3. Inside the loop, apply the `pig_latinify_word` function to each word in the vector and store the transformed word back in the vector.\n4. Return the transformed vector.\n\nLet's start by implementing the `pig_latinify_word` function. It takes a word as input and returns the pig latin version of the word. The rules for transforming a word to pig latin are as follows:\n\n- If the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), then add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n- If the word starts with a consonant, move the consonant to the end of the word and add \"ay\" to the end.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `pig_latinify_word` function:","status":200,"tokens":[320,207],"elapsed":3.385422667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
