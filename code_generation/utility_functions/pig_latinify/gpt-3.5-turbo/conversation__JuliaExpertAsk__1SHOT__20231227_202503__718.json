Here's an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia using multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latinify_word(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_word(word::String)\n    vowels = Set('aeiou')\n    \n    if isempty(word) || isvowel(word[1])\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        split_index = findfirst(isvowel, word) - 1\n        return word[split_index+1:end] * word[1:split_index] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nTo use the `pig_latinify` function, pass a vector of strings as an argument and it will return a new vector with the pig latin transformations of each word.\n\nNote that when using multithreading, be aware of any potential race conditions and ensure that shared resources are protected if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[97,234],"elapsed":4.149305541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
