The function uses multithreading to process each string in parallel. The `pig_latinify_single_string` function is responsible for transforming a single string into pig latin by splitting it into words and applying the `pig_latinify_word` function to each word. The `pig_latinify_word` function performs the actual pig latin transformation by checking if the word starts with a vowel or a consonant and applying the appropriate transformation.","status":200,"tokens":[97,352],"elapsed":8.233313875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
