It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here's an example implementation of the `pig_latinify` function that transforms a vector of strings into pig latin using separate threads for each iteration:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if word[0] in vowels:\n        return word + 'ay'\n    else:\n        return word[1:] + word[0] + 'ay'\n\ndef pig_latinify_thread(word):\n    transformed_word = pig_latinify(word)\n    print(f'{word} -> {transformed_word}')\n\ndef pig_latinify_parallel(words):\n    threads = []\n    for word in words:\n        thread = threading.Thread(target=pig_latinify_thread, args=(word,))\n        thread.start()\n        threads.append(thread)\n\n    for thread in threads:\n        thread.join()\n\n# Example usage\nwords = ['hello', 'world', 'pig', 'latin']\npig_latinify_parallel(words)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `pig_latinify` function takes a word as input and returns its pig latin transformation. The `pig_latinify_thread` function is responsible for printing the original word and its transformed version. The `pig_latinify_parallel` function creates a separate thread for each word in the input vector and starts them. Finally, it waits for all threads to finish using the `join` method.\n\nNote that the order of the printed output may vary due to the parallel execution of threads.","status":200,"tokens":[59,311],"elapsed":7.122885541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
