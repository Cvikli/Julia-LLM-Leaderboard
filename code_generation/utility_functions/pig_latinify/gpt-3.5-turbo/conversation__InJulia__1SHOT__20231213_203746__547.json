Here's an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia that operates on a vector of strings and transforms them into pig latin. Each iteration runs on a separate thread using the `Threads.@threads` macro.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    piglatin = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    \n    @threads for i in 1:length(strings)\n        piglatin[i] = pig_latinify_string(strings[i])\n    end\n    \n    return piglatin\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_string(string::String)::String\n    words = split(string)\n    \n    piglatin_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if istitle(word)\n            piglatin_word = title_case(apply_pig_latin_rules(lowercase(word)))\n        else\n            piglatin_word = apply_pig_latin_rules(word)\n        end\n        \n        push!(piglatin_words, piglatin_word)\n    end\n    \n    return join(piglatin_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction apply_pig_latin_rules(word::String)::String\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    \n    if occursin(r\"^[AEIOUaeiou]\", word)\n        return word * \"way\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(word)\n        if occursin(r\"^[AEIOUaeiou]\", word[i])\n            return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return word * \"ay\"\nend\n\nfunction istitle(string::String)::Bool\n    !isempty(string) && isuppercase(first(string))\nend\n\nfunction title_case(string::String)::String\n    first_char = first(string)\n    rest = lowercase(string[2:end])\n    return first_char * rest\nend\n```\n\nYou can now call the `pig_latinify` function, passing in a vector of strings, and it will return a new vector with the pig latin representations of the input strings. Each iteration of the transformation will run on a separate thread, taking advantage of multi-threading.\n\nNote: Be cautious when using multi-threading with this code as the pig latin conversion for each string is not an expensive computation, and the overhead of thread creation and management might outweigh the benefits of parallelization.","status":200,"tokens":[62,490],"elapsed":11.513639792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
