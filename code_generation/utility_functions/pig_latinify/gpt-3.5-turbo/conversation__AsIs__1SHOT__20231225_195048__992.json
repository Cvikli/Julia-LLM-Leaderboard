Here's an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function that performs pig latin transformation on a vector of strings, with each iteration running on a separate thread:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    \n    if word[0] in vowels:\n        return word + 'ay'\n    else:\n        return word[1:] + word[0] + 'ay'\n\ndef pig_latin_thread(word):\n    transformed_word = pig_latinify(word)\n    print(f\"Pig Latin Thread: {threading.currentThread().name} - Transformed word: {transformed_word}\\n\")\n\ndef pig_latinify(string_list):\n    threads = []\n\n    for word in string_list:\n        thread = threading.Thread(target=pig_latin_thread, args=(word,))\n        thread.start()\n        threads.append(thread)\n\n    for thread in threads:\n        thread.join()\n\n    print(\"All transformations complete.\")\n\n# Example usage\nwords = ['hello', 'world', 'python']\npig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `pig_latinify` function creates a separate thread for each word in the input vector. The `pig_latin_thread` function is the target function for each thread, which calls the `pig_latinify` function to transform the word and prints the result. The `threading.Thread` class is used to create and start each thread. Finally, the main thread waits for all the created threads to finish using the `thread.join()` function.","status":200,"tokens":[59,325],"elapsed":4.809248167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
