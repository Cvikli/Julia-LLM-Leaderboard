Define a function `pig_latinify(word::String)` that takes in a word as input and returns its pig latin transformation.\n2. In the `pig_latinify` function, check if the word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). If it does, add \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n3. If the word starts with a consonant, move all the consonants at the beginning of the word to the end, and add \"ay\" to the end.\n4. Initialize an empty vector `pig_latin_words` to store the pig latin transformed words.\n5. Iterate over each word in the input vector of strings using the Threads.@threads macro to run each iteration on a separate thread.\n6. Inside the loop, call the `pig_latinify` function on the current word and append the result to `pig_latin_words`.\n7.
