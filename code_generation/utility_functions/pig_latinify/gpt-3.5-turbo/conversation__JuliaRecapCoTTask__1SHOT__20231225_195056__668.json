[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define a function called `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Inside the `pig_latinify` function, create an empty vector called `result` to store the pig latinized strings.\n3. Use a `Threads.@threads` loop to iterate over each string in the input vector in parallel.\n4. Inside the loop, split the current string into words using the `split` function.\n5. For each word, check if it starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). If it does, append \"way\" to the word.\n6. If the word does not start with a vowel, move the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word, and append \"ay\" to it.\n7. Join the pig latinized words back into a string using the `join` function with a space delimiter.\n8. Append the pig latinized string to the `result` vector.\n9. After the loop is complete, return the `result` vector.\n\nNow let's implement this solution in Julia:","status":200,"tokens":[320,235],"elapsed":3.254795541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
