It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a function called `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Create an empty vector called `result` to store the pig latin transformed strings.\n3. Iterate over each string in the input vector using a `@threads` loop.\n4. Inside the loop, transform the current string to pig latin using the pig latin rules.\n5. Append the transformed string to the `result` vector.\n6. Return the `result` vector.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}()\n    @threads for string in strings\n        transformed_string = pig_latin_transform(string)\n        push!(result, transformed_string)\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNow, I will define the `pig_latin_transform` function that applies the pig latin rules to a single string:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin_transform(string::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if string[1] in vowels\n        return string * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return string[2:end] * string[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nFinally, I will test the `pig_latinify` function with the given example:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nThe expected output should be `[\"ellohay\", \"appleay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[170,343],"elapsed":7.689259666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
