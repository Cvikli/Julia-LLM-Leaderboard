The `pig_latinify` function iterates over each word in the vector, and for each word it translates it to pig latin using another function called `translate_to_pig_latin`.\n\nThe `translate_to_pig_latin` function checks if the first letter of the input word is a vowel. If it is, it returns the word followed by \"way\". Otherwise, it finds the index of the first vowel in the word and then constructs the pig latin translation by concatenating the substring before the vowel, the substring after the vowel (including the vowel), and the suffix \"ay\".\n\nFinally, the `pig_latinify` function creates a vector of transformed words for each thread to work on separately, using the `parallel.foreach` loop. Once all threads have finished, it returns the vector of pig latin translations.","status":200,"tokens":[193,483],"elapsed":13.297369208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
