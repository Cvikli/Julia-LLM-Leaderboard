It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\npig_latin = Tuple{String, Int}[]\n\nfor i in 1:length(words)\ngo!(thread.(pig_latinify_task, words[i], i))\nend\n\nreturn pig_latin\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_task(word::String, index::Int)\nif isalpha(firstchar(word))\nprefix = firstsubstr(word, 1:index)\nsuffix = restof(word, index:length(word)-1)\n\npig_latin[index] = suffix.(lowercase.(~firstchar(suffix))))\npig_latin[index] = pig_latin[index] + \"ay\"\nelse\npig_latin[index] = word\nend\nend\n```\nThis code uses the `Threads` library to start separate threads for each string. It defines a function called `pig_latinify_task`, which is responsible for converting one string into pig latin. \n\nThe main function, `pig_latinify`, simply initializes an array of tuples (`pig_latin[i] = (words[i], i)`), and then calls `go!(thread.(pig_latinify_task, words[i], i))` for each string.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple implementation of Pig Latin, where if the first character of a word is an alphabet letter, the second part (the rest of the word) starts with the first letter moved to the end and then \"ay\" is added at the end. If the first character isn't a letter, it just returns the word as it is.","status":200,"tokens":[69,454],"elapsed":11.842170375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
