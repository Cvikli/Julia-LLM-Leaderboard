[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This problem involves creating a function that transforms each string in a vector to Pig Latin. Each transformation will be executed on a separate thread. Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries and functions. \n\n```julia\nimport Base, IO, System\nimport Threads as T\nuse T::Queue\nuse T::Thread\n```\n\n2. Define the function `pig_latinify` that accepts a vector of strings as input and returns the Pig Latin version of each string in the same order.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\nfor i in 1:length(strings)\n# Extract the first consonant or consonant cluster from the beginning of the string\nfirst_consonants = \"\"\nfor j in 1:i-1\nif (isalpha(strings[j])) && (islowercase(strings[j]), !isuppercase(strings[j+1])) {\npush!(first_consonants, strings[j]);\nbreak\nend\n}\n\n# If the string begins with a vowel or the first consonant cluster is empty, simply add 'ay' to the end of the string\nif (isvowel(strings[i])) || first_consonants.empty() {\npush!(output, strings[i] + \"ay\")\n}\n\n# If the string begins with a consonant cluster, move the consonant cluster to the end of the string and add 'ay' at the beginning\nelse {\nfirst_consonants = join(\"\", reverse(first_consonants))\npush!(output, first_consonants + \"ay\" + strings[i])\n}\nend\n\nreturn output\nend\n```\n\n3. Define the function `pig_latinify_threaded` that accepts a vector of strings as input and returns the Pig Latin version of each string in the same order, but with each transformation executed on a separate thread.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify_threaded(strings)\noutput = []\nfor string in strings\n# Create a new Thread object to execute the transformation on a separate thread\nthread = T.Thread(target: lambda{pig_latinify(string)}(), args: (string,))\n\n# Start the Thread and add its result to the output vector\nthread.start()\npush!(output, string)\nend\n\nreturn output\nend\n```\n\n4. Call the `pig_latinify_threaded` function with a vector of strings as input and print the output.\n\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"python\", \"is\", \"awesome\"]\nprint(pig_latinify_threaded(strings))\n```\n\nThis solution defines two functions: `pig_latinify` and `pig_latinify_threaded`. The first function transforms a single string to Pig Latin, while the second function uses threads to transform each string in a vector. Both functions are implemented using Julia's standard libraries and syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[355,736],"elapsed":21.729643209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
