Each thread calls the `translate_to_pig_latin` function, which converts each individual string to pig latin and stores it in the result vector. The threads are not blocked by the main thread, so they all run simultaneously, making this solution efficient.\n\nThe `translate_to_pig_latin` function works as follows: \n\n- It checks if the first letter of the input word is a vowel or a consonant. If it's a vowel, it adds \"ay\" to the end of the word; otherwise, it moves all consonants before the first vowel to the end and then adds \"ay\".\n\n- If there are no vowels in the word, it checks if there are any consecutive 'a' characters. If so, it moves all of them to the end of the word and then adds \"ay\" at the end. \n\n- Finally, if there are no vowels and not any consecutive 'aa', it moves all the consonants before the first vowel to the end, adding \"ay\".\n\nWith this approach, we can convert a vector of strings into pig latin in a parallelized manner using threads in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[193,621],"elapsed":17.168946875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
