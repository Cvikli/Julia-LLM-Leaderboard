I first thought through the steps needed to solve the problem: creating a function `pig_latinify` that will transform each string in the input vector into Pig Latin and push it onto a separate thread for processing.\n2. Then, I wrote the necessary functions, such as `pig_transform`, which takes a single word and converts it to Pig Latin based on the rules provided (add 'way' if the first letter is a vowel, otherwise move the first consonant cluster to the end and add 'ay').\n3. Finally, I implemented the `pig_latinify` function by iterating over each string in the input vector, calling `pig_transform` on it, and pushing the transformed result onto a separate thread for processing. The transformed results are then returned as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[193,347],"elapsed":13.1310265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
