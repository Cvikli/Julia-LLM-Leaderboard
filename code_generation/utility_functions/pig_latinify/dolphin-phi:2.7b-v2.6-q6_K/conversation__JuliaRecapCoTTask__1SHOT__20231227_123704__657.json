[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Then, we will create a vector of strings and use Julia's ability to run threads in parallel to translate each string into pig latin.\n\nHere is the code for the solution:\n```julia\nusing DataStructures\nusing Threads\n\n# Pig Latin Transformer Function\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)::AbstractString\nif startsWith(\"a\", word) || startsWith(\"e\", word) || \nstartsWith(\"i\", word) || startsWith(\"o\", word) || \nstartsWith(\"u\", word)\nend\nreturn word + \"way\"\nelse\nindex = index_of(word, \"aeiou\") - 1\nif index >= 0\nreturn word[index+1:end] + word[1:index] + \"ay\"\nelse\nreturn word + \"ay\"\nend\nend\nend\n\n# Main Function to Apply Pig Latin Transformer on a Vector of Strings\nfunction main(input::Vector{String})\nthreads = Thread.new()\nfor i in 1:length(input)\nthreads%!push!(Thread(target=pig_latinify, args=(input[i],)))\nend\n\n# Wait for all threads to finish\ncollect!(threads)\nend\n```\nThis solution defines the `pig_latinify` function that takes a string as input and returns its pig latin equivalent. It then creates a vector of strings and uses Julia's ability to run threads in parallel to translate each string into pig latin. The main function handles the creation of threads and waits for them to finish before returning the result.","status":200,"tokens":[358,398],"elapsed":11.909649083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
