[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We will also use the built-in Pig Latin rules:\n1. If a word starts with a vowel, add \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n2. If a word starts with a consonant, move all consonants at the start of the word to the end and then add \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\nusing Timeit\nimport Base.Threading;\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\npig_latin = function(word::AbstractString)\nif startsWith('aeiou', word)\nreturn word * \"ay\"\nelse\nfirst_vowel = indexfirst(vowels, word)\nreturn word[first_vowel+1...] * first_vowel + \"ay\"\nend\nend\n\nresult = Vector{String}()\nfor w in words\nt = Threading.spawn(function()\npush!(result, pig_latin(w))\nend)\nend\nreturn result\nend\n```\n\nLet's test this function with some example data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"python\"]\npig_latin = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", pig_latin)\n```\n\nThis should output: `[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"ythonpay\"]`, which are the Pig Latin translations of the input words.
