It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin.

For words that begin with vowel sounds, you just add \"way\" or \"ay\" to the end.\n\n2. **Multithreading Approach**: To leverage Julia's multithreading capabilities, start a new thread for each word transformation using `Threads.@spawn`.\n\n3. **Implement Function**: Write the `pig_latinify` function to apply the pig latin transformation for each word in a vector of strings, utilizing multithreading for each iteration.\n\n4. **Pig Latin Transformation Logic**: Apply the specific transformation based on whether a word starts with a vowel or a consonant.\n\n5. **Ensuring Correctness**: After applying transformations, the function should return a vector of transformed words maintaining the original order.\n\n## Write any functions and other code you need\n\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for (i, char) in enumerate(word)\n            if char in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    # If no vowel is found, consider it as starting with a consonant for simplicity\n    return word * \"ay\"\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    tasks = [Threads.@spawn(to_pig_latin(word)) for word in words]\n    return [fetch(task) for task in tasks]\nend\n```\n\n## Solve the task\nWe now solve the task using the given data.\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\n## Check that your solution is correct\nTo ensure correctness, the output should follow the rules of pig latin transformation for each word from the input `[hello, apple, strong, world]`. \n\n- \"hello\" -> \"ellohay\"\n- \"apple\" -> \"appleway\"\n- \"strong\" -> \"ongstray\"\n- \"world\" -> \"orldway\"\n\nRemember, the correctness when dealing with multithreading also involves ensuring that each word is processed separately in its own thread, which is internally handled by Julia's threading model when using `Threads.@spawn`.","status":200,"tokens":[170,536],"elapsed":48.822943667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
