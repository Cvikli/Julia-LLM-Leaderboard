It leverages Julia's native threading capabilities, making each string's conversion potentially run on a separate thread for better performance with large datasets or on multi-core systems. Note that for the parallel computation to be effective, Julia should be started with multiple threads (for instance, by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable).","status":200,"tokens":[170,311],"elapsed":19.633087834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
