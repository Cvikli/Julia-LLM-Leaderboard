[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Define the `pig_latinify` function to accept a vector of strings.\n2. For each string in the vector, create a new thread where the transformation to pig latin will occur. Pig Latin simple rule: move the first letter of each word to the end of the word, then add \"ay\" to the end of the word. Words that start with a vowel just get \"way\" appended.\n3. Combine the results from all threads and return the transformed vector.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString) \n    if occursin(r\"^[aeiouAEIOU]\", word)\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    transformed = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    tasks = [Threads.@spawn begin\n                transformed[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n            end for i in 1:length(words)]\n    \n    for task in tasks\n        wait(task)\n    end\n\n    return transformed\nend\n```\n\n## Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nTo ensure the validity, consider a vector with different starting letters:\n\n- Input: `[\"happy\", \"duck\", \"glove\", \"egg\"]`\n- Expected Output: `[\"appyhay\", \"uckday\", \"lovegay\", \"eggway\"]`\n\nLet's also check that threading is utilized:\n\n1. **Implementation detail**: Using `Threads.@spawn` suggests multiple threads should be doing the work. However, the actual parallelization heavily depends on the number of threads Julia was started with. By default, Julia starts with 1 thread unless specified otherwise by using the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` or `-t`/`--threads` command-line option.\n\n2. Execution of `Threads.@spawn`.\n\nRemember, to truly test the multithreading aspect, ensure Julia is started with more than one thread.","status":200,"tokens":[319,524],"elapsed":40.06519825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
