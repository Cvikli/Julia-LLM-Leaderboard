X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Remember, Pig Latin rules typically involve moving the first letter of each word to the end of the word and adding \"ay\" at the end. However, if a word starts with a vowel, we simply add \"way\" or \"ay\" at the end.\n\n### Recall Useful Julia Snippets\n\n1. Threading: `using Base.Threads`, `@threads for ...`\n2. String manipulation: slicing strings with `str[2:end]*str[1]*\"ay\"`\n3. Checking for vowels: `\"a\" in str, ...`\n\n### Solve the Task\n\nWe will define the function `pig_latinify` that iterates over a vector of strings, transforms each into its Pig Latin equivalent, and does so utilizing multiple threads for processing.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n\n    # Helper function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\n    function to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n        if isempty(word) return word end\n        first_char = lowercase(word[1])\n        if first_char in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            # For words starting with a vowel, add \"way\" at the end\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            # For words starting with a consonant, move first letter to end and add \"ay\"\n            return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Define a vector with the same size to store the results\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    # Utilize multi-threading for transforming each word\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\n### Double-Check the Solution\n\nLet's verify that the solution correctly transforms a list of words into Pig Latin, including both conditions (words starting with vowels and consonants), and operates on separate threads for each transformation.\n\n1. It correctly converts words starting with consonants by moving the first letter to the end and appending \"ay\".\n2. It correctly handles words starting with vowels by appending \"way\".\n3. Utilizes threads as requested (each word transformation runs in its own thread).\n\nNote: Ensure your Julia session is started with multiple threads to see the benefit from multi-threading. For example, you can start Julia with multiple threads by setting the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` to the desired number of threads before launching Julia, or by using the `-t` or `--threads` command-line option.\n\n```bash\njulia -t auto  # Automatically uses the maximum number of threads\n```","status":200,"tokens":[320,618],"elapsed":51.629083166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
