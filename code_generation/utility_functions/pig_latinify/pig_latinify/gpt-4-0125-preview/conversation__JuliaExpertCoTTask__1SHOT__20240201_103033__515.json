The rules for pig latin are:\n        - If a word begins with a consonant, all consonants before the first vowel are moved to the end of the word, and \"ay\" is appended. Example: \"hello\" -> \"ellohay\"\n        - If a word begins with a vowel, just add \"way\" at the end of the word. Example: \"apple\" -> \"appleway\"\n    - To process each word in parallel, we'll spawn a new thread for each transformation.\n    - Collect the transformed words into a new vector to return.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need:**\n   \nFirst, let's delineate a helper function for the pig latin transformation:\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String) :: String\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for (i, c) in enumerate(word)\n            if c in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word * \"ay\"  # Fallback, handles words without vowels, though technically not in scope.\nend\n```\n   \nNext, implement the main `pig_latinify` function using threading:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @spawn\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    tasks = Task[]\n    for word in words\n        push!(tasks, @spawn to_pig_latin(word))\n    end\n\n    return [fetch(t) for t in tasks]\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n\nNow, let's solve the given task with the data provided.\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\n```\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n\nTo confirm the correctness of our solution, we should inspect the output.\n```julia\nprintln(pig_latinified)  # Expected: [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nBy following each step methodically, we have developed a parallelized solution for transforming a list of words into Pig Latin.","status":200,"tokens":[170,527],"elapsed":48.312245167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
