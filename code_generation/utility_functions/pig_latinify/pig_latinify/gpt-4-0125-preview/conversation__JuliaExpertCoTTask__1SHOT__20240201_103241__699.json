For true multi-threading, we make use of Julia's `Threads.@spawn` inside a loop.\n   - Gather results from each thread and ensure the order is maintained as the original input vector.\n   \n4. **Combine Results and Return:**\n   - Collect the transformed strings into a new vector.\n   - Maintain the original order of input strings.\n\n### Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n\n```julia\n# This function checks if the first character is a vowel\nis_vowel(c) = c in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n\n# This function transforms a single word into pig latin\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    if is_vowel(lowercase(word[1]))\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# The main function to transform a vector of strings into pig latin\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    n = length(words)\n    transformed = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    tasks = Vector{Task}(undef, n)\n    \n    for i in 1:n\n        tasks[i] = Threads.@spawn transformed[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    for task in tasks\n        wait(task)\n    end\n    \n    return transformed\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\n\nWe have already developed the solution in the function `pig_latinify` which takes care of the task.\n\n### Step 4: Check that your solution is correct\n\nNow, let's test the function with the provided data.\n\n```julia\nresults = pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\nprintln(results)\n```\n\n**Expected:** \n\nThe expected result will be a transformed list of words into Pig Latin:\n\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleay\", \"trongsay\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nThe above steps and code provide a structured and systematic approach to transforming English words into Pig Latin using Julia, leveraging concurrency for individual transformations.","status":200,"tokens":[170,584],"elapsed":46.971353667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
