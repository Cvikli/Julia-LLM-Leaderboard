Each string in the vector is processed to convert it into Pig Latin. The transformation of each word to Pig Latin is done in parallel using `Threads.@threads`, allowing each iteration to run on a separate thread. Note that parallel efficiency largely depends on the number of available threads which is determined by the environment in which Julia is running.","status":200,"tokens":[97,242],"elapsed":19.638276541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
