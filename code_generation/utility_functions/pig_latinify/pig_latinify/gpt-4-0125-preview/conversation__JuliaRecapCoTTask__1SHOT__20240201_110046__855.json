[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Remember to start Julia with multiple threads to make use of this concurrency. You can do this by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable before starting Julia, for example: `export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4`.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction transform_to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString) :: AbstractString\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    if occursin(r\"^[aeiouAEIOU]\", word)\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for i in eachindex(word)\n            if occursin(word[i], vowels)\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString}) :: Vector{AbstractString}\n    pig_latin_results = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(words))\n\n    @sync begin\n        for (index, word) in enumerate(words)\n            @spawn begin\n                pig_latin_results[index] = transform_to_pig_latin(word)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_results\nend\n```\n\nKey aspects to note:\n- We encapsulate the pig latin transformation logic within a separate function `transform_to_pig_latin` to clarify. This function is fairly rigid in its pig latin rules for simplicity.\n- The main function `pig_latinify` iterates over the input vector of strings, processing each item on a separate thread using `@spawn`. The `@sync` macro is used to ensure all threads complete their work before proceeding.\n- Results are stored in the same order as the input given by storing transformed words at their respective index in a pre-allocated results vector.\n- The transformation function assumes lowercase words for its vowel checking - a real implementation might include more sophisticated handling for casing, punctuation, and word patterns but is omitted here for brevity.\n- To effectively utilize multithreading, make sure Julia is started with multiple threads as mentioned earlier through `JULIA_NUM_THREADS`. Performance gains will vary based on the complexity of tasks and the number of available CPU cores.\n\nThis approach provides a simple, thread-based method to apply a fun text transformation to a list of strings in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[320,604],"elapsed":67.519116667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
