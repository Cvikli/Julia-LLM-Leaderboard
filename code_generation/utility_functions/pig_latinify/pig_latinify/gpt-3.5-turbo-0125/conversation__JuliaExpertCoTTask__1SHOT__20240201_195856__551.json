Define a function `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of strings.\n2. Within the function, iterate over each string in the vector.\n3. For each string, create a new task/thread that transforms the string into pig latin.\n4. Return the vector of strings in pig latin form.\n\n### Implement the pig latin transformation logic\n\n1. Define a function `to_pig_latin` that takes in a string and converts it to pig latin.\n2. Move the first letter of the string to the end and add \"ay\" at the end.\n3. Return the modified string.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    return word[2:end]*word[1]*\"ay\"\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\n# Test the pig_latinify function\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\nThis code defines the `pig_latinify` function that transforms a vector of strings into pig latin with each transformation happening in a separate thread. The code also includes a helper function `to_pig_latin` for converting a single word to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[170,307],"elapsed":2.117113833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
