The `pig_latin` function is responsible for converting a single word to Pig Latin. Finally, an example usage of the function is provided at the end.\n\nPlease make sure to run this code in a Julia environment that supports multi-threading for it to work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[62,362],"elapsed":2.897396417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
