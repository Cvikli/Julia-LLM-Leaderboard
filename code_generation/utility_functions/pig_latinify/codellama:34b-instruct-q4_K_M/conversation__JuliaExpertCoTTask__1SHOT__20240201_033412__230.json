We create a channel `ch` to store the transformed strings.\n2. We iterate over each string in parallel using threads using the `foreach` function from the `Threads` module.\n3. For each string, we call the `pig_latinize` function on it and put the result into the channel using the `put!` function.\n4. Finally, we return the transformed strings as a vector using the `collect` function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that you have already defined the `pig_latinize` function elsewhere in your code. This function should take a single string argument and return its pig latin translation.","status":200,"tokens":[0,310],"elapsed":8.680105238,"_type":"aimessage"}]
