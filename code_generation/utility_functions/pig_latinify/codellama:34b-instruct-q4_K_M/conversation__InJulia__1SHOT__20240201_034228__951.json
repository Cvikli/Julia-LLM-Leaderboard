Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String})\n    output = Vector{String}(undef, length(input))\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(input)\n        Threads.@spawn begin\n            output[i] = pig_latinize(word)\n        end\n    end\n    return output\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinize(word::String)\n    # Implement the pig latin transformation here\n    # For example, you could use a regular expression to move the first letter of the word to the end and add \"ay\"\n    return Regex.replace(word, r\"^(\\w+)(\\W+)\", \"$2$1ay\")\nend\n```\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as input, and returns a vector of transformed strings using the `pig_latinize` function. The `pig_latinize` function uses a regular expression to move the first letter of each word to the end and add \"ay\".\n\nThe `Threads.@spawn` macro is used to create a new thread for each iteration of the loop, which allows the transformations to be applied in parallel. This can improve performance if you have a large input vector and multiple CPU cores available.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the words in the input vector are separated by whitespace, and that the output should also be separated by whitespace. If your use case requires different behavior, you may need to modify the regular expression or add additional logic to the `pig_latinize` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":10.368533784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
