[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It creates a channel to communicate between threads and starts a thread for each string. Each thread performs the pig latin transformation on its corresponding string and puts the transformed string into the channel. The main thread waits for all threads to finish and takes the transformed strings from the channel.\n\nThe `transform_to_pig_latin` function takes a string as input and splits it into words. It then performs the pig latin transformation on each word using the `transform_word_to_pig_latin` function and joins the transformed words back into a single string.\n\nThe `transform_word_to_pig_latin` function takes a word as input and splits it into letters. It then moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\" to form the pig latin word.","status":200,"tokens":[0,625],"elapsed":17.628142057,"_type":"aimessage"}]
