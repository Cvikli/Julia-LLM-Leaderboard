Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Additionally, each iteration should run on a separate thread. Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @spawn\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{String})\n    # Define an anonymous function to perform the pig latin transformation\n    pig_latin = x -> begin\n        prefix = x[1] == 'a' || x[1] == 'e' || x[1] == 'i' || x[1] == 'o' || x[1] == 'u' ? \"\" : string(x[1])\n        suffix = x[2:end] * prefix\n        return prefix * \"ay\" * suffix\n    end\n\n    # Spawn a separate thread for each input string and apply the pig_latin function\n    results = @spawn begin\n        Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(input)\n            input[i] = pig_latin(input[i])\n        end\n        return input\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we define an anonymous function `pig_latin` that takes a single string argument `x` and performs the pig latin transformation. We then use Julia's `@spawn` macro to spawn a separate thread for each input string in the vector `input`, and apply the `pig_latin` function to each input string using a `Threads.@threads` loop. Finally, we return the transformed input vector using the `return` statement.\n\nNote that we use Julia's `Base.Threads` module for managing threads, which is more efficient than manually creating and managing threads. Also, we use the `@spawn` macro to create a separate thread for each input string, rather than creating a single thread for all the inputs, to improve parallelism and reduce overhead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,468],"elapsed":13.181574868,"_type":"aimessage"}]
