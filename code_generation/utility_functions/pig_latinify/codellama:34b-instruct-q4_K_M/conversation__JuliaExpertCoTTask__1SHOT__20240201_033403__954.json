It iterates over each string and creates a task that performs the pig latin transformation on the current string using the `@spawn` macro. The result of each task is stored in a vector of threads, which are then waited for completion using the `wait.` function. Finally, the transformed strings are returned using the `map` function to fetch the results from each thread.","status":200,"tokens":[205,310],"elapsed":15.106710402,"_type":"aimessage"}]
