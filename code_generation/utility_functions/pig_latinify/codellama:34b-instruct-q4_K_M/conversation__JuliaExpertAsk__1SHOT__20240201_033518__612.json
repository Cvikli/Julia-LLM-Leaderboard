Each string is transformed using a separate thread, which puts the transformed string into the channel. Once all threads are finished, the function waits for the channel to be closed and returns the collected transformed strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,280],"elapsed":7.793166241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
