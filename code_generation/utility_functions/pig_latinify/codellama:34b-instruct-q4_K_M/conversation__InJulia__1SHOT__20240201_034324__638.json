Each thread transforms the string to Pig Latin using the `pig_latinify_string` function and puts the transformed string on a channel. The main thread reads the transformed strings from the channel and returns them as a vector.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector contains only strings, and it does not handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the transformation process. You may want to add error handling and/or exception handling to make the code more robust.","status":200,"tokens":[0,452],"elapsed":12.543280506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
