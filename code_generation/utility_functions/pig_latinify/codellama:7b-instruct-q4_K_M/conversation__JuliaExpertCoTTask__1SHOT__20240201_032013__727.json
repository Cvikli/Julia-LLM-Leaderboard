The `pig_latinify_worker` function takes a single argument, which is the word to be transformed, and implements the Pig Latin transformation on that word.\n\nNote that the `pig_latinify` function does not return anything, since it only performs side effects (i.e., modifying the input list). The `pig_latinify_worker` function returns `None`, indicating that it has completed its task without returning any useful value.","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":1.95977578,"_type":"aimessage"}]
