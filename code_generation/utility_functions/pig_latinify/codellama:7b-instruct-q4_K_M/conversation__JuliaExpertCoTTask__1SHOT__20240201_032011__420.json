Each thread will perform the Pig Latin transformation on a separate string in the vector, which is implemented in the `pig_latinize` function.\n\nFinally, we return the vector of strings with each string converted to Pig Latin.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `pig_latinify` function:\n```\njulia> pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"ellohay\"\n \"eapplay\"\n \"onggstray\"\n \"orldway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":3.028180651,"_type":"aimessage"}]
