The resulting pig latin strings are returned as a vector of strings.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input strings are valid UTF-8 strings. If you need to handle invalid UTF-8 data, you may need to use an error handling strategy such as returning an `Option<String>` instead of a `String`, and handling errors using the `try!` macro.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":2.974991768,"_type":"aimessage"}]
