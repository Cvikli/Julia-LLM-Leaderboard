It uses the `@spawn` macro to create a new thread for each iteration of the loop, and the `@threads` macro to parallelize the computation across all available CPU cores. The `pig_latinize` function is defined separately, as it can be used by both `pig_latinify` and the `main` method.","status":200,"tokens":[0,577],"elapsed":4.802323114,"_type":"aimessage"}]
