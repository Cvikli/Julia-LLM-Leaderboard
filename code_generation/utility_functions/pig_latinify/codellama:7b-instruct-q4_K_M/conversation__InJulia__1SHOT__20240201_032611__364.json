For each iteration, it uses the `Threads.@spawn` macro to run the transformation logic on a separate thread. The transformed string is then assigned back to the original string in the input vector. Finally, the function returns the modified vector of strings.\n\nNote that the `Distributed` package is required for this functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[0,181],"elapsed":1.556565269,"_type":"aimessage"}]
