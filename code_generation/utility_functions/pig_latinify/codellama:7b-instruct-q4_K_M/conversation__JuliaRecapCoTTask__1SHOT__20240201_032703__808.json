[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here are the steps I will follow to solve this task:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* Iterating over a vector of strings using `for` loop\n\t* Changing each string in the vector using `replace` function\n\t* Running each iteration on a separate thread using `Threads.@threads` macro\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for s in strings\n        # Change string to Pig Latin\n        new_string = replace(s, r\"[aeiou]\", \"\")\n        if isempty(new_string)\n            new_string = \"way\"\n        end\n        new_string *= \"ay\"\n        # Replace original string with the Pig Latin version\n        strings[findfirst(==(s), strings)] = new_string\n    end\n    return strings\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with a small vector of strings to ensure it works correctly\n\t* Run performance benchmarks to compare the speed of the `pig_latinify` function with other possible solutions\n\nNote that this implementation uses the `@threads` macro from Julia's Standard Library to run each iteration on a separate thread. This can significantly improve the performance of the function for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[0,322],"elapsed":2.757713083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
