It creates a vector of threads, one for each string in the input vector, and then iterates over each thread and changes it to pig latin using the `string -> begin ... end` syntax. The `begin ... end` block is executed on a separate thread for each iteration, allowing the function to operate on each string concurrently.","status":200,"tokens":[0,267],"elapsed":2.219930541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
