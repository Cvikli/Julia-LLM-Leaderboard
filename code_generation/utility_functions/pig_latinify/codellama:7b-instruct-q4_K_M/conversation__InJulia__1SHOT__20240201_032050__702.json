The function creates a channel to communicate between threads, iterates over each string in the vector using `@threads`, and converts each string to Pig Latin on a separate thread. Finally, it collects the results from each thread and returns a vector of Pig Latin strings.\n\nNote that this code assumes that you have defined a `pig_latin` function that implements the Pig Latin conversion logic. You can define this function yourself or use an existing implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[70,372],"elapsed":3.086636554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
