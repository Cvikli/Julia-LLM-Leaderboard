X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

However, it doesn't actually transform the strings into Pig Latin, since no such function exists. A proper solution would need to define a `pig_latin` function that modifies the input string and then apply this function to all strings in the array. Here's an updated version of the code that correctly defines a `pig_latin` function and applies it using threads:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    threads = []\n    for str in strs\n        thread = Threads.@spawn atoi(str)\n        push!(threads, thread)\n    end\n    result = [fetch(t) for t in threads]\nend\n```\nHowever, since the function `atoi` doesn't exist and it is unclear what exactly needs to be transformed into Pig Latin (e.g., only alphabetic characters?), this solution cannot be fully evaluated as correct.","status":200,"tokens":[379,401],"elapsed":14.180364167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
