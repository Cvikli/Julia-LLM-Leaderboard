Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia code snippet that demonstrates how you can create a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings and uses separate threads to process each string:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    threads = Vector{Thread}()\n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        t = @spawn begin\n            words[i] = convert(String, latinify(words[i]))\n        end\n        push!(threads, t)\n    end\n    wait.(threads)\n    return words\nend\n```\n\nThis function first creates a vector of `Thread` objects to manage the separate threads. Then, it iterates over each string in the input vector and starts a new thread for each iteration using the `@spawn` macro from the `Threads` module. Inside each thread, it applies the `latinify` function to convert the string to Pig Latin and stores the result back in the original vector of strings. Finally, the function waits for all threads to finish using the `wait` function and returns the modified vector of strings.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have defined a function called `latinify` that takes a single string as input and returns its Pig Latin version. You will need to define this function separately or modify the code accordingly to use your existing Pig Latin conversion logic.","status":200,"tokens":[73,314],"elapsed":9.737968625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
