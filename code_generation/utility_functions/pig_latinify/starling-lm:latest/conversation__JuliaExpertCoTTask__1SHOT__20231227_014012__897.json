We will use this function later in our main function.\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    consonants = [\"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]\n    if word[1] in consonants\n        return lstrip(word * \"way\")\n    else\n        return replace(word, \"ay\" => \"way\")\n    end\nend\n```\nStep 2: Define the main function `pig_latinify`. This function takes a vector of strings and applies the pig latin transformation to each string. It uses multiple threads to perform this operation concurrently. We will use Julia's multi-threading capabilities to achieve this. Here is the implementation:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    results = []\n    threads = []\n    for word in words\n        thread = Thread(() -> push!(results, pig_latin(word)))\n        push!(threads, thread)\n        start!(thread)\n    end\n    for t in threads\n        wait(t)\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\nStep 3: Test the `pig_latinify` function with the provided data:\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\nThis will give us the desired output, which is a vector of Pig Latin versions of the input strings.","status":200,"tokens":[202,415],"elapsed":18.818094875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
