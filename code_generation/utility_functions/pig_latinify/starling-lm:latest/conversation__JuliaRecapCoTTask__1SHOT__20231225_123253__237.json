[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It then defines the `pig_latinify` function, which takes an array of strings as input and applies a pig latin transformation on each string using the `Threads.@spawn` macro:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Threads\")\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        Threads.@spawn push!(result, pig_latin(word))\n    end\n    return result\nend\n\npig_latin(word) = replace(string(word), \"^(.*?)(\\w)$\" => s -> s[2:end] * s[1] * \"ay\")\n```\nThis program first adds and imports the `Threads` package for multithreading. It defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input, and applies the pig latin transformation to each string using `Threads.@spawn`. The `pig_latin` function is a simple transformation function that replaces the first letter in a word with the rest of the word concatenated to the end, then appends \"ay\".\n\nTo use this program, run it in Julia and call the `pig_latinify` function with an array of strings as the argument. The program will return a vector of pig latin-transformed words on separate threads.","status":200,"tokens":[381,342],"elapsed":12.295507792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
