[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The translated words are then concatenated back into a single string.\n\nPlease note that in Julia, `@sync` is used to synchronize multiple asynchronous tasks, while `@async` is used to mark the beginning of an asynchronous block of code.\n\nKeep in mind that running each translation on separate threads may not always result in performance improvement due to overhead associated with creating and managing threads, especially for small input strings or when using Julia's default threading implementation.\n\nTo use this function, simply call `pig_latinify(str)` where `str` is the input string you want to transform.","status":200,"tokens":[379,350],"elapsed":12.641004083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
