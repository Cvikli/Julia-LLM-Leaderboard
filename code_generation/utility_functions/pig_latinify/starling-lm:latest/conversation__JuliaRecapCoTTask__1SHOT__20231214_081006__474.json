Based on the provided information, here are the steps I will follow to solve the task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\t* Key syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation.\n\t* Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested.\n\t* Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n\t* Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`.\n2. Solve the Task\n\t* Write a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input and applies the Pig Latin transformation to each string, using a separate thread for each string.\n\t* Implement the Pig Latin transformation logic using Julia's control structures and functions.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct\n\t* Test the `pig_latinify` function with various inputs to ensure it produces the correct output.\n\t* Use debugging tools such as print statements or the `PPrint` function to visualize the internal state of the function and ensure it is behaving correctly.\n\nSpecial Instructions (if any):\n{{instructions}}\n\nBased on the provided instructions, I will prioritize them over the general guidelines above. Please provide the specific instructions you would like me to follow.","status":200,"tokens":[11,425],"elapsed":15.469435709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
