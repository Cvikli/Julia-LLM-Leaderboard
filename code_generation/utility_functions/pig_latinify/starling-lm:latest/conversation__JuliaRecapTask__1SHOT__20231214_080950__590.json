Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

I'm excited to help you with this task using my systematic approach to problem-solving in Julia. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nStep 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets (5 minutes)\nI will quickly review some useful Julia snippets that may be helpful for this task, such as control structures like `if-elseif-else`, `for`, and `while`, functions like `function f(x) end`, anonymous functions like `x -> x^2`, arrays like `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing like `a[1:2]`, tuples like `(1, 2)`, namedtuples like `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionaries like `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, and string interpolation with `$`.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task (30 minutes)\nI will use Julia's built-in concurrency features to write a pig Latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. I will iterate over each string in parallel using Julia's `parallels` package, and for each string, I will apply the Pig Latin transformation using a recursive function. Here is an outline of the code:\n```julia\nusing Parallels\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    # Use parallelism to iterate over the strings\n    parallels( strings |> map(pig_latin) )\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(x)\n    # Recursively apply Pig Latin transformation\n    if x[1] == 'a'\n        return string(\"ay\", x[2:end])\n    elseif x[1] == 'e' || x[1] == 'i' || x[1] == 'o' || x[1] == 'u'\n        return string(\"ie\", x[2:end])\n    else\n        return string(\"ay\", x[1:end-1]) .* \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-check the Solution (10 minutes)\nTo ensure that the solution is correct, I will manually test the `pig_latinify` function with a few input vectors of strings and verify that the output is indeed in Pig Latin.\n\nTotal time estimated: 55 minutes\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns before we begin!","status":200,"tokens":[370,536],"elapsed":22.886888292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
