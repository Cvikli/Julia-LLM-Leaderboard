In particular:\n\n1. Your code must use a function called `pig_latinify` (not just any old function). You can choose what its input and output types are, but make sure you call it with the right arguments at some point in your program.\n2. You should have one or more separate threads that iterate over the vector of strings and transform them to pig latin.\n3. The code should be thread-safe (e.g., you shouldn't crash or corrupt memory when multiple threads call `pig_latinify` at once).\n'''\n# Python 2/3 compatibility\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nimport re, threading\ndef pig_latinify(strings):\n    strings = list(reversed(strings))\n    for i in range(len(strings)):\n        if len(strings) > 1:\n            threading.Thread(target=pig_latin, args=(strings[i],)).start()\n        else:\n            pig_latin(strings[i])\n            \ndef pig_latin(str):\n    print(str + \"ay\")","status":200,"tokens":[49,340],"elapsed":18.509890625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
