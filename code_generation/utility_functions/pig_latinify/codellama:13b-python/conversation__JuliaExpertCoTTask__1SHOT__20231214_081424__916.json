Here is my implementation of `pig_latinify`:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    # Use parallel threads to apply Pig Latin transformation to each string\n    num_threads = Threads.nthreads()\n    threads = Threads. ThreadPool(num_threads)\n    results = Dict()\n    \n    for (i, string) in enumerate(strings)\n        # Create a new thread to apply Pig Latin transformation\n        thread = threads[i]\n        thread = pig_latinify_thread(string, thread)\n        results[i] = thread.result\n    end\n    \n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_thread(string)\n    # Apply Pig Latin transformation to the input string\n    output = map(c -> c == 'a' ? 'ay' : ifelse(c == 'i', 'iy', c), string)\n    return output\nend\n```\nLet me explain how this code works:\n\n1. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and creates a pool of `num_threads` threads using the `ThreadPool` module. Each thread applies the Pig Latin transformation to a single string in the input vector.\n2. The `pig_latinify_thread` function takes a single string as input and applies the Pig Latin transformation to it. It uses the `map` function to iterate over each character in the string and apply the transformation rules. The `ifelse` function is used to handle the special cases of 'i' and 'a'.\n3. The `pig_latinify` function returns a dictionary with the output of each thread. Each key in the dictionary corresponds to a string in the input vector, and the value is the Pig Latin transformation of that string.\n4. To use the `pig_latinify` function, you can call it with a vector of strings as input, like this: `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`. The function will apply the Pig Latin transformation to each string in the input vector and return the results.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[187,504],"elapsed":18.660372833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
