X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is a sample solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(v)\n    return @threads :vec map(v) do word\n        if word[1] in ('A':'Z') || word[1] in ('a':'z')\n            vowel = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            \n            # Check for vowel as the first letter of a word\n            if isin(word[1], vowel)\n                return \"$(word)-ay\"\n            end\n                    \n            # Reverse the order of consonants until encountering a vowel, then append \"-ay\" to the original word.\n            new_word = \"\"\n            for i in 2:length(word)\n                if isin(word[i], vowel)\n                    new_word *= substr(word, 1, i-1)\n                    break\n                else\n                    new_word *= word[i]\n                end\n            end\n            \n            return \"$(new_word)$(substr(word, 1))-ay\"\n        else\n            # Return the original word if it starts with a non-alphabetic character.\n            return word\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n\n* The function `pig_latinify` takes as input a vector of strings (`v`).\n* It uses Julia's multi-threading capabilities by annotating the `map` call with `@threads :vec`. This parallelizes the operation across multiple threads.\n* Inside the map, we define an inner function to handle each word separately.\n* We start by checking if the first character of the word is a letter (`A`-`Z` or `a`-`z`). If it's not, we return the original word unchanged.\n* If the first character is a vowel, we append `-ay` to the end of the word and return the modified string.\n* For consonants at the beginning of words, we iterate through the characters until we encounter a vowel. We then reverse the order of the consonants, append `-ay`, and return the transformed word.\n\nThis solution should provide an efficient and effective way to transform a vector of strings into pig latin while utilizing Julia's built-in multi-threading capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[0,574],"elapsed":23.888447072,"_type":"aimessage"}]
