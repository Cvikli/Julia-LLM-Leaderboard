It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(result)\n        word = words[i]\n        if isempty(word) || !isalpha(word[1])  # keep as-is\n            result[i] = word\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        first_letter = lowercase(word[1])\n        new_word = string(word[2:end], first_letter, \"ay\")\n        result[i] = join(new_word)\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses multithreading to process each word in parallel. The `@threads` macro splits the work between multiple threads, allowing for faster processing of a large number of words. The function returns a vector of pig latinified words in the same order as the input.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":9.546032561,"_type":"aimessage"}]
