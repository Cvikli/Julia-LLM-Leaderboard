It iterates over each string in parallel, using multithreading. It checks if each word starts with a letter, and if so, it modifies the word according to pig latin rules: moving the initial consonant or vowel cluster to the end of the word, adding \"ay\" after that, and keeping the rest of the word intact. If the word does not start with a letter (e.g., is empty), it keeps the original word. The modified words are returned as a vector in the same order as the input. \n\nThis function can be called as follows: `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, which would return the result `[\"ellohay\", \"appleyay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]`.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that all words are in lowercase and do not contain any punctuation. If you want to handle additional cases (e.g., capitalizing words, handling punctuation), you would need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,448],"elapsed":18.531573729,"_type":"aimessage"}]
