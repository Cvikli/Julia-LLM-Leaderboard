[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following code performs the task in Julia, taking into account the guidelines you provided:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString) :: String\n    # If the first letter is a vowel, add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n    if startswith(lowercase(word), ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n        return string(word, \"way\")\n    else\n        # Find the first vowel in the word (if one exists) and move all letters before it to the end.\n        for (i, c) in enumerate(word)\n            if c in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n                return string(word[i:end], word[1:i-1], \"ay\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # If there are no vowels, just add \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n    return string(word, \"ay\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a single word as input and returns the pig latin version of that word. It handles words with initial consonants or vowels by moving them around appropriately. \n\nTo iterate over each word in a vector of strings using separate threads, you can use parallelism features like Threads.@threadsfor:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String}) :: Vector{String}\n    # Create an empty array to store the translated words.\n    translations = String[]\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in parallel, applying the translation function.\n    Threads.@threadsfor i in 1:length(words)\n        push!(translations, pig_latinify(words[i]))\n    end\n\n    return translations\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, we use `Threads.@threadsfor` to parallelize the loop over words. The macro `@threads` is used for multithreaded computing, and it executes the code in its argument concurrently on multiple threads. \n\nNote that this function assumes that you have a vector of strings already stored in memory. If you need help reading from files or converting input to an array of strings, let me know.","status":200,"tokens":[0,508],"elapsed":21.1605934,"_type":"aimessage"}]
