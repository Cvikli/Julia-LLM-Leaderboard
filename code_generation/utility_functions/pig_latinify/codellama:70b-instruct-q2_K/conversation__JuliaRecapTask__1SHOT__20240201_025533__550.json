[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Use Julia's in-built multithreading capabilities for parallel processing of the input vector. This will significantly improve the efficiency and performance of your solution.\n2. Iterate through each string in the input vector, using a `foreach` loop that leverages Julia's built-in parallelism capability to distribute work across multiple threads.\n3. For each string, apply the pig latin transformation logic:\n\t* Check if the first letter is a vowel (`\"a\"`, `\"e\"`, `\"i\"`, `\"o\"`, or `\"u\"`). If it is a vowel, add `\"way\"` to the end of the word and move on to the next word.\n\t* If the first letter is not a vowel:\n\t\t+ Check if the string contains a consonant cluster (multiple consonants that form one syllable) at the beginning. If it does, move those consonants to the end of the string and add `\"ay\"`.\n\t\t+ If there is no consonant cluster, simply move the first letter to the end of the word and add `\"ay\"`.\n4. Finally, collect the transformed words into a new vector and return it as the result of your function.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```julia-repl\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Define the vowel characters.\n    vowels = Set(\"aeiou\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty vector to store transformed words.\n    transformed_words = String[]\n    \n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        # Check if the first letter is a vowel.\n        starts_with_vowel = lowercase(word[1]) ∈ vowels\n        \n        if starts_with_vowel\n            transformed_words = [transformed_words; \"$(word)way\"]\n            \n        else\n            # Check for consonant clusters.\n            cluster_index = findfirst(c -> lowercase(c) ∈ vowels, word)\n        \n            if isnothing(cluster_index) || cluster_index == 2\n                transformed_words = [transformed_words; \"$(word[1])$(word[2:end]).ay\"]\n                \n            else\n                # Move the consonant cluster to the end of the word.\n                transformed_words = [transformed_words; \"$(word[(cluster_index+1):end])$(word[1:(cluster_index-1)]).ay\"]\n        \n            end\n            \n        end\n    end\n    \n    return transformed_words\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use Julia's `Set` type to define the vowels. We iterate through each word in the input vector using a parallelized loop (`Threads.@threads`), and transform each word based on whether it starts with a vowel or not.\n\nRemember that pig latin is a made-up language, so you can choose how strictly you want to follow its rules when implementing this function. The key takeaway is the use of Julia's built-in multithreading capabilities for efficient parallel processing of input data.","status":200,"tokens":[377,704],"elapsed":29.649829106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
