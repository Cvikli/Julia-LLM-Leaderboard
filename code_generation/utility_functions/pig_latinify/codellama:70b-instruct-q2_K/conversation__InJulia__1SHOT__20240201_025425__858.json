It uses Julia's built-in parallel construct `@threads for` to iterate over each word in the provided array, using threads to execute the loop concurrently. The `pig_latin` function handles the actual transformation of each word into Pig Latin. üêñ üíª\n\nNote that this code assumes you're working with a single-case alphabet (all uppercase or all lowercase) in your input words, and does not handle punctuation or special characters. It also does not perform any validation to ensure that each word is valid (e.g., checking for non-alphabetical characters). üêñ üí°","status":200,"tokens":[0,587],"elapsed":24.064472173,"_type":"aimessage"}]
