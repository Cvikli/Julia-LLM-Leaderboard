Define the `pig_latinify` function that takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. Use `Threads.map` to iterate over each string and apply the pig latin transformation on a separate thread.\n3. Define a helper function `to_pig_latin` that takes a string as input and returns the pig latin version of the string.\n4. Check that the solution is correct by providing the example from the task.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    if startswith(word, ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_index = findfirst(isequal('a'), word) |>\n                            findfirst(isequal('e'), word) |>\n                            findfirst(isequal('i'), word) |>\n                            findfirst(isequal('o'), word) |>\n                            findfirst(isequal('u'), word)\n        return word[first_vowel_index:end] * word[1:first_vowel_index-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word_list::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    return Threads.map(to_pig_latin, word_list)\nend\n\n@assert pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]) == [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function works by creating a new vector of strings where each string is the result of applying the `to_pig_latin` function to each element of the input vector `word_list`. The `to_pig_latin` function takes a string as input and returns the pig latin version of the string. The function checks whether the string starts with a vowel or a consonant and transforms it accordingly. The first vowel is found using `findfirst` and the rest of the string is moved in front of it, followed by \"ay\". If the string already starts with a vowel, \"way\" is added at the end. The `Threads.map` function is used to apply the `to_pig_latin` function on a separate thread for each string in the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[195,574],"elapsed":7.662279458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
