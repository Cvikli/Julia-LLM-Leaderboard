The `Threads.@threads` macro is used to run each iteration in a separate thread.\n\nThe function first initializes a new vector `result` with the same size as `strs`. It then iterates over `strs` and checks if each string is empty. If it is, the corresponding element in `result` is set to an empty string.\n\nIf the string is not empty, the function extracts the first character and the rest of the string. It then checks if the first character is a letter (either lowercase or uppercase). If it is, the function concatenates the rest of the string, the first character, and \"ay\" to form the pig latin version of the string. If the first character is not a letter, the function simply concatenates the original string with \"ay\".\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` vector.","status":200,"tokens":[107,426],"elapsed":5.70287475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
