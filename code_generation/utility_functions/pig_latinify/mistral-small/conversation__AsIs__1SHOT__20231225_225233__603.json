The function uses the `par_iter_mut` method from the Rayon library to create a parallel iterator that modifies the strings in-place. The iterator yields pairs of (index, string), so that we can remove the initial consonants from the last word in the vector (otherwise, the length of the vector would change during iteration, leading to undefined behavior). Each string is transformed to pig latin using the following rules:\n\n* If the first letter is a vowel, append \"way\" to the end of the string.\n* Otherwise, take the initial consonants and move them to the end of the string, followed by \"ay\".\n\nFinally, the function removes any non-alphabetic characters from the last word in the vector.\n\nNote that the `retain` method used in the last line of the iterator is not thread-safe, so it is only called for the last word after the iterator has completed. This ensures that the code is still thread-safe.","status":200,"tokens":[63,579],"elapsed":12.262527416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
