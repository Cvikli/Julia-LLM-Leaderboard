It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Threads.@threads` macro to run iterations in separate threads. Here's a simple implementation of `pig_latinify`:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(sentences)\n    result = similar(sentences)\n\n    Threads.@threads for (i, sentence) in enumerate(sentences)\n        result[i] = pig_latinize(sentence)\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinize(word)\n    if any(isletter, word)\n        consonants = chop(word[1:findfirst(isletter, word) - 1])\n        vowels = word[findfirst(isletter, word):end]\n        return vowels * consonants * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, the `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings `sentences` and creates a new vector `result` with the same size. It then iterates over `sentences` using the `Threads.@threads` macro. Each iteration calls `pig_latinize(sentence)` to translate the sentence into pig latin and stores the result in `result`.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function translates a single word into pig latin. It first checks if the word contains any letters. If not, it returns the word unchanged. If the word contains letters, it splits the word into consonants and vowels, and then returns the vowels, followed by the consonants, and then \"ay\". Note that this is a simple implementation, and you may need to modify it depending on your desired pig latin rules.","status":200,"tokens":[66,405],"elapsed":5.576961166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
