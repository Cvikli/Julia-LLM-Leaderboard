Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro to iterate over the vector in parallel:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(words)\n\n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        if isempty(word)\n            result[i] = word\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if all(islowercase, word)\n            prefix = word[1:1]\n            suffix = word[2:end]\n        else\n            prefix = word[1:findfirst(islowercase, word)]\n            suffix = word[findfirst(islowercase, word):end]\n        end\n\n        result[i] = suffix * \"_\" * prefix * \"ay\"\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function handles both lowercase and mixed-case words, moving the initial consonant cluster to the end and appending \"ay\" to create the pig latin version. The input vector `words` is transformed in parallel using multiple threads for better performance with large input vectors. The function returns a new vector with the pig latin transformations.","status":200,"tokens":[107,278],"elapsed":3.789354166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
