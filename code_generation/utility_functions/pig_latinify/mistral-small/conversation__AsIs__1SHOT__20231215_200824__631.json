Here's an implementation of `pig_latinify` in Rust that uses the Rayon library to parallelize the iteration over the vector of strings:\n```rust\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n\nfn pig_latinify(words: Vec<&str>) -> Vec<String> {\n    words.par_iter()\n         .map(|word| pig_latinize(word))\n         .collect()\n}\n\nfn pig_latinize(word: &str) -> String {\n    let mut chars = word.chars();\n    let first_char = chars.next().unwrap();\n    let rest_of_word = chars.as_str();\n    if \"aeiou\".contains(first_char.to_lowercase().as_str()) {\n        format!(\"{}-hay\", word)\n    } else {\n        format!(\"{}-{}ay\", rest_of_word, first_char)\n    }\n}\n```\nHere's how it works:\n\n* The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of string slices (`Vec<&str>`) and returns a vector of owned strings (`Vec<String>`).\n* We use the `par_iter` method from the Rayon library to create a parallel iterator over the vector of words.\n* We then use the `map` method to apply the `pig_latinize` function to each word in the parallel iterator.\n* Finally, we collect the results into a new vector using the `collect` method.\n* The `pig_latinize` function takes a single word as input and returns the corresponding pig latin version of the word.\n* We first split the word into its first character and the rest of the word.\n* If the first character is a vowel, we simply append \"hay\" to the end of the word.\n* If the first character is a consonant, we move the first character to the end of the word and append \"ay\".\n* Note that we use the `to_lowercase` method to ensure that the comparison with the vowels is case-insensitive.\n\nI hope this helps!
