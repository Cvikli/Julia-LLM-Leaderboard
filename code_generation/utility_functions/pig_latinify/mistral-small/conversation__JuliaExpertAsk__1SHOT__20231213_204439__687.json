It applies the pig latin transformation to each word, handling both lowercase and mixed-case words. The function returns a new vector with the pig latin transformed words. Note that this implementation does not guarantee the order of the output vector due to the nature of parallel processing.","status":200,"tokens":[107,290],"elapsed":3.968524625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
