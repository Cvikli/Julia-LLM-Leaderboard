However, keep in mind that creating threads has an overhead, and for small arrays, the parallel version might be slower than the single-threaded one. Here's the pig Latin transformer in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction isvowel(c)\n    return c in 'a' : 'z' && c in 'A' : 'Z' && c âˆˆ ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::AbstractString)\n    if isvowel(word[1])\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for (i, c) in enumerate(word)\n            if isvowel(c)\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word * \"ay\"\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vec(strings::Vector{String})\n    result = similar(strings)\n\n    Threads.@threads for (i, word) in enumerate(strings)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(word)\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that converts a single word to pig latin. The `pig_latinify_vec` function applies the `pig_latinify` function to each word in a vector of strings in parallel using the `Threads.@threads` macro. Note that we use a pre-allocated vector `result` to store the results, as working with shared arrays in parallel can lead to race conditions and other issues.","status":200,"tokens":[66,408],"elapsed":5.456531833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
