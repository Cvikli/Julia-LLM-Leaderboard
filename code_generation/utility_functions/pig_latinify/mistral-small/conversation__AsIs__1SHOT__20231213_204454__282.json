Here's an implementation of `pig_latinify` in Rust that uses the Rayon library for parallel iteration:\n```rust\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n\nfn pig_latinify(words: Vec<String>) -> Vec<String> {\n    words.par_iter_mut().map(|word| {\n        let mut chars = word.chars();\n        let first_char = chars.next().unwrap();\n        let rest_of_word = chars.as_str();\n        if first_char.is_alphabetic() {\n            format!(\"{}-{}hay\", rest_of_word, first_char)\n        } else {\n            format!(\"{}-{}ay\", word, first_char)\n        }\n    }).collect()\n}\n```\nHere's how it works:\n\n* The `par_iter_mut()` method from the Rayon library creates a parallel iterator that we can use to modify each string in the vector in place.\n* We use `map()` to transform each string into its pig latin equivalent.\n* To convert a word to pig latin, we check if the first character is alphabetic. If it is, we move it to the end of the word and append \"hay\". Otherwise, we append \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n* Finally, we collect the results into a new vector and return it.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector `words` is not empty. If it's possible for `words` to be empty, you'll need to add a check at the beginning of the function to handle that case.","status":200,"tokens":[63,379],"elapsed":6.862130042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
