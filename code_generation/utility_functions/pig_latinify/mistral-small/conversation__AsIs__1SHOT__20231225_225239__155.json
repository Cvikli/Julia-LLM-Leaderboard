Here's an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Rust that uses the Rayon library to perform the iterations in parallel:\n```rust\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\n\nfn pig_latinify(input: Vec<String>) -> Vec<String> {\n    input.par_iter_mut().map(|word| {\n        let mut word_clone = word.clone();\n        if word_clone.is_empty() || word_clone.chars().next().unwrap().is_whitespace() {\n            return;\n        }\n        let first_letter = word_clone.remove(0);\n        word_clone.push_str(&format!(\"{}ay\", first_letter));\n        *word = word_clone;\n    }).collect()\n}\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n* It takes a vector of `String`s as input and returns a new vector of `String`s as output.\n* It uses the `par_iter_mut` method from the Rayon library to create a parallel iterator over the input vector, where each element is a mutable reference to a `String`.\n* For each `String`, it checks if it's empty or contains only whitespace. If so, it skips that `String` and moves on to the next one.\n* Otherwise, it removes the first letter of the `String` and appends the letter along with \"ay\" to the end of the `String`. For example, \"apple\" becomes \"appleyay\".\n* Finally, it overwrites the original `String` with the new pig latin version and collects all the modified `String`s into a new vector, which is returned as output.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector is not modified by other threads while `pig_latinify` is running. If the input vector may be modified by other threads, you'll need to use synchronization mechanisms such as locks or atomic operations to ensure thread safety.","status":200,"tokens":[63,454],"elapsed":6.152105209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
