The `pig_latinify` function uses the `Threads.jl` package to create multiple threads and iterate through each string in the vector, transforming it into pig latin using the `pig_latin` function within the separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[105,336],"elapsed":13.662507834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
