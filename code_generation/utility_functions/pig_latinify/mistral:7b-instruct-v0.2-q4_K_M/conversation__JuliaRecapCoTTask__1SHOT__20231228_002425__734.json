X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\nend # Define the function without body\n\nfunction first_letter(str::AbstractString)\nend\n\nfunction cons!(head, tail::Vector{Union{AbstractString, Vector{AbstractString}}})\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinize(first::Char, rest::Vector{Char})\nend\n```\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    first = first_letter(str)\n    rest = String(str[2:end])\n    pig_latinized = pig_latinize(first, rest)\n    return String(pig_latinized)\nend\n\nfunction first_letter(str::AbstractString)\n    return str[1]\nend\n\nfunction cons!(head, tail::Vector{Union{AbstractString, Vector{AbstractString}}})\n    push!(tail, head)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinize(first::Char, rest::Vector{Char})\n    if length(rest) > 0 && isa(first, Char)\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        first_is_vowel = first in vowels\n        consonant_cluster = rest[1:findfirst(x -> x âˆˆ vowels, rest) - 1]\n        return cons!(pig_latinize(consonant_cluster, rest)[2:end], string(first, \"ay\"))\n    else\n        return rest\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{AbstractString})\n    threads = Thread[]\n    pig_latinized = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(strs))\n\n    for str in strs\n        push!(threads, Thread(pig_latinify, str))\n    end\n\n    for thread in threads\n        pig_latinized[thread.id] = thread.result\n        wait(thread)\n    end\n\n    return pig_latinized\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as its argument and returns a new vector with each string transformed to pig latin. The transformation occurs in separate threads for parallel processing. The `pig_latinize` function transforms the input string to pig latin by identifying the first consonant cluster followed by a vowel and moving that cluster to the end of the string, appending \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[372,659],"elapsed":28.789756666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
