Think through my approach step by step:\n   a. Use Julia's multithreading capabilities to apply pig latin transformation on each string in parallel.\n   b. Write a helper function `pig_latin` to transform a single string into pig latin.\n   c. Utilize Julia's `Threads.jl` library for parallel processing.\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(str::String)\n    first_letter = str[1]\n    consonants = [\"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]\n    index = findfirst(x -> x == first_letter, consonants)\n\n    return string(\"ay\", str[index+1:end], first_letter)\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(arr::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(arr)\n        arr[i] = pig_latin(arr[i])\n    end\n    return arr\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nusing REPL\nREPL.load(\"pig_latin.jl\") # Assuming you saved the code in a file named pig_latin.jl\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\n\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\nThe solution should produce the following output:\n\n```julia\n[\"ellohay\", \"pplehay\", \"rongstay\", \"ldrawoy\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[193,446],"elapsed":19.501198583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
