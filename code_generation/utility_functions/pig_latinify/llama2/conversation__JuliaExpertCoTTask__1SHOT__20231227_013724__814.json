Let's get started. Here's my implementation of `pig_latinify`:\n```julia\n# Utility function to convert a string to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latin(word)\n    if length(word) == 1 && word[1] >= 'a' && word[1] <= 'z'\n        # Shortcut for single-letter words\n        return word[1] + \"ay\"\n    else\n        # Otherwise, use the full Pig Latin conversion\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Main function to apply Pig Latin transformation to a vector of strings\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    threads = Threads.ntotal()\n    for i in 1:threads\n        # Split the input string into a list of words\n        words = split(string, \" \")\n        # Create a new thread to apply Pig Latin transformation to each word\n        thread = Thread(function()\n            for word in words\n                result = pig_latin(word)\n                push! strings, result\n            end\n        end)\n        # Start the thread\n        run(thread)\n    end\n    return strings\nend\n\n# Example usage\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\n```\nLet me explain how this code works:\n\n1. The `pig_latin` function takes a single string argument and returns the Pig Latin translation of that string. If the input string is a single letter, the function returns the letter followed by \"ay\". Otherwise, it returns the input string concatenated with \"ay\".\n2. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and applies the Pig Latin transformation to each string using a separate thread. The function splits each input string into a list of words using the `split` function, and then creates a new thread for each word. Each thread applies the `pig_latin` function to the corresponding word and pushes the resulting Pig Latin translation onto a new vector.\n3. The `run` function starts the thread for each word.\n4. The `return` statement at the end of the `pig_latinify` function returns the final vector of Pig Latin transformations.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input strings are all in English, since it uses the \"a\" to \"z\" range for the Pig Latin conversion. If you want to support other languages, you may need to modify the `pig_latin` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[205,569],"elapsed":25.754569375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
