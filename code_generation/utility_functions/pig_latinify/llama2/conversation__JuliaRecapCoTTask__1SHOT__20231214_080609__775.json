[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

As a world-class Julia programmer, I will follow a systematic approach to solving this problem. Here are the steps I will take:\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n\n* `Threads` package for parallelism\n* `Parallel` package for distributed parallelism\n* `Dictionaries` package for working with dictionaries\n* `Arrays` package for working with arrays\n* `Lazy` package for working with lazy sequences\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task\n\nI will write a function `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of strings and returns a vector of Pig Latin transformed strings. Here is an outline of the code:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    # Use Parallel package to run on multiple threads\n    @parallel for i in 1:length(strs)\n        strs[i] = translate(strs[i], :PigLatin)\n    end\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-check the solution is correct\n\nI will test the `pig_latinify` function with some sample inputs to ensure it produces the correct output. Here are some test cases:\n```julia\n# Sample Inputs\nstrs = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"how\", \"are\", \"you\"]\n\n# Test Cases\n@test pig_latinify(strs) == [\"olleh\", \"worlx\", \"hou are yu\", \"ou xaroo\"]\n```\nStep 4: Implement the Special Instructions (if any)\n\nIf there are any special instructions provided, I will prioritize them over the general guidelines. Please provide the instructions and I will implement them accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[11,401],"elapsed":14.555451334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
