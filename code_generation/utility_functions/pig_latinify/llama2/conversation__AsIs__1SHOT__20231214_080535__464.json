Each thread is responsible for transforming a single string, and the results are collected in a list when all threads have finished.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input list of strings will fit comfortably within the available memory of your system. If the list is very large, you may want to consider using a more memory-efficient approach, such as processing the list of strings sequentially or using a different parallel processing library.","status":200,"tokens":[53,532],"elapsed":17.941622375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
