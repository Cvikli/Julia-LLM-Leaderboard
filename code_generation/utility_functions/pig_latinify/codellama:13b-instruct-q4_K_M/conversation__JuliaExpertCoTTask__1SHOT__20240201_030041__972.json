For each string, it splits it into individual words using the `split` function, and then iterates over each word using another `for` loop. Inside this inner loop, it checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not using the `in` keyword. If it's a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds \"ay\". Finally, it joins all the words back together into a single string using the `join` function.\n\nNote that this function uses the `Threads` module from Julia to run each iteration on a separate thread. This can make the function faster for large input arrays.","status":200,"tokens":[0,378],"elapsed":5.183691448,"_type":"aimessage"}]
