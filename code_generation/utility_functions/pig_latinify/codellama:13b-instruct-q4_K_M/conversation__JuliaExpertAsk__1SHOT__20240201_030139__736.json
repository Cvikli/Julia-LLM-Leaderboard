Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    nthreads = min(length(strings), nthreads())\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(strings))\n    @threads for i in 1:nthreads\n        thread_id = threadid()\n        local j = (thread_id - 1) * ceil(Int, length(strings) / nthreads) + 1\n        local k = min(j + ceil(Int, length(strings) / nthreads) - 1, length(strings))\n        for string in strings[j:k]\n            results[i] = pig_latinify(string)\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(string::String)\n    # Your implementation goes here\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `@threads` macro to spawn multiple threads, and each thread operates on a subset of the input strings. The `pig_latinify` function is called for each string in the subset, and the results are stored in an array. Finally, the array of results is returned.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector of strings is long enough to justify parallel processing. If the input vector is too small, it may be more efficient to process the strings serially rather than using multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":4.530748441,"_type":"aimessage"}]
