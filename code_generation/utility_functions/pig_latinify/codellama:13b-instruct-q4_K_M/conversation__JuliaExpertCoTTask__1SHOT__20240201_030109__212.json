It creates a new vector to store the transformed words and iterates over each word in parallel using threads. For each word, it checks if the length is less than 3 characters and adds it to the transformed vector as-is if that's the case. Otherwise, it gets the first letter and its position in the word and checks if it's a vowel. If it is, it adds \"way\" to the end of the word. If not, it moves the first letter to the end of the word and adds \"ay\". Finally, it pushes the transformed word to the transformed vector.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed_words) # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"strongway\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,535],"elapsed":7.301461382,"_type":"aimessage"}]
