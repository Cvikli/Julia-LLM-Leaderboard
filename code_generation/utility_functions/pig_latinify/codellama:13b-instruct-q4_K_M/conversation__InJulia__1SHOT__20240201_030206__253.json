The transformation is performed using the `if` statement to check if the first letter of the word is a vowel, and the `else` clause to move the first letter to the end of the word and add \"ay\" if it is not a vowel.\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with a vector of strings:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(transformed_words) # Outputs: [\"elhloway\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,390],"elapsed":5.244948686,"_type":"aimessage"}]
