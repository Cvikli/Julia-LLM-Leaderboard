The `push!` function is used to add the transformed word to the output vector.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each string in the input vector is a single word, and it does not handle cases where there are multiple words or punctuation characters in the same string. If your input strings can contain multiple words or punctuation characters, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,195],"elapsed":2.690320809,"_type":"aimessage"}]
