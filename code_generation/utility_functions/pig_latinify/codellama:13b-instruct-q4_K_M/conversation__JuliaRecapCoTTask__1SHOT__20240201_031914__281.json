[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function splits the input string into words using the `split` function, and then iterates over each word in a separate thread using the `@threads` macro. For each iteration, it checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase or lowercase letter, and then returns the pig latin form of the word accordingly. Finally, the function joins the modified words together to form the final output.\n\nNote that we use `isletter` and `isuppercase` functions from Julia's standard library to check if the first character is a letter and an uppercase letter respectively. We also use `string` function to concatenate the characters together.\n\nAlso, we use the `split` function to split the input string into words. This function splits the input string based on whitespace by default, but it can be customized using the second argument to specify a different separator.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":4.789898431,"_type":"aimessage"}]
