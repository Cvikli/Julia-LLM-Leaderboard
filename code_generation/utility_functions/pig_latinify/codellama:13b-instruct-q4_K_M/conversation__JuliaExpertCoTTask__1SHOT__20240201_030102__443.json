When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    threads = Thread[]\n    for word in words\n        thread = @spawnat :any begin\n            vowel_indices = findall(c -> c âˆˆ \"aeiou\", word)\n            if isempty(vowel_indices)\n                # If there are no vowels, just return the original word\n                word\n            else\n                # If there are vowels, move them to the end and add \"ay\"\n                word[end-length(vowel_indices)+1:end] *= \"ay\"\n                word[begin:end-length(vowel_indices)] = word[begin:end-length(vowel_indices)-1]\n            end\n        end\n        push!(threads, thread)\n    end\n    return [fetch(t) for t in threads]\nend\n```\nThis solution uses the `@spawnat` macro to create a separate thread for each word, and then uses `findall` to find the indices of all vowels in the word. If there are no vowels, it simply returns the original word. Otherwise, it moves the vowels to the end of the word and adds \"ay\" before returning the result.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that you have defined a `Thread` type and imported the `Base.Threads` module at the top of your code. If you haven't done so, you may need to add these lines at the beginning of your code:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\ntype Thread\n    id::Int\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,371],"elapsed":4.992497051,"_type":"aimessage"}]
