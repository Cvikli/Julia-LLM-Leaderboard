The `pig_latinify` function is called on each string in the vector, and the results are stored in a separate vector. The `pig_latinify` function works by splitting the input string into words, transforming each word using the `pig_latinify` function, and then joining the transformed words back into a single string.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all of the input strings are valid English words. If any of the input strings contain invalid characters or are not in English, the results may be unexpected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,564],"elapsed":7.529798019,"_type":"aimessage"}]
