It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python program that uses concurrent.futures to perform the task of pig latin transformation.\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    return f'{word}ay' if word[0].lower() in 'aeiou' else f'{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay'\n\ndef main():\n    words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']  # add more words here\n    \n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:\n        futures = {executor.submit(pig_latinify, word): word for word in words}\n        \n        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):\n            word = futures[future]\n            \n            try:\n                print(future.result())\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f'{word} generated an exception {e}')\n                \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\nThis script creates a set of futures for each word in the `words` list, and uses ThreadPoolExecutor to execute these tasks concurrently. The result is printed out in the order they finish. Please note that this program will work properly on Python 3.5 or later because this version introduced the asyncio module which can be used with the asyncio.run function to create a background event loop for executing the tasks.\n\nAlso, please notice that Pig Latin is not very well defined linguistically, it's just a fun game but in practical use there are multiple ways of implementing it, thus the implementation here is basic and will just move the first vowel or consonant to the end of the word appended with 'ay'.","status":200,"tokens":[109,408],"elapsed":12.652567458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
