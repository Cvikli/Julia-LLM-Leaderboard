Here is my implementation of `pig_latinify`:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    # Create a thread pool to parallelize the conversion process\n    threads = Thread Pool(() -> convert_string(string), strings)\n\n    # Start the threads and wait for them to finish\n    threads.map(join)\nend\n\n# Function to convert a string to Pig Latin\nfunction convert_string(string)\n    # Check if the input string is empty\n    if length(string) == 0\n        return string\n    end\n\n    # Split the input string into individual characters\n    characters = split(string, \"\")\n\n    # Loop through each character and apply the Pig Latin transformation\n    for i in 1:length(characters)\n        character = characters[i]\n        if character == \"a\" || character == \"e\" || character == \"i\" || character == \"o\" || character == \"u\"\n            # Transform the character to Pig Latin\n            character = string(character, \"ie\")\n        elseif character == \"t\"\n            # Transform the character to Pig Latin\n            character = string(\"tay\", character)\n        else\n            # Leave the character unchanged\n            character\n        end\n        characters[i] = character\n    end\n    return join(characters, \"\")\nend\n```\nLet me explain how this code works:\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input and applies the Pig Latin transformation to each string in parallel using a thread pool. The `convert_string` function is a recursive function that takes a single string as input and applies the Pig Latin transformation to it. It checks if the input string is empty, in which case it returns the empty string directly. Otherwise, it splits the input string into individual characters, loops through each character, and applies the Pig Latin transformation. Finally, it constructs the transformed string by joining the transformed characters back together.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[187,468],"elapsed":17.395485042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
