[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's an example of how you might write a `pig_latinify` function that works on vectors of strings and uses separate threads to convert each string into pig latin:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))  # to store the transformed words\n    lock = ReentrantLock()  # for synchronizing access to shared state (result)\n\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = first(word)  # get the first letter of the string\n        rest_of_the_string = word[2:end] * \"ay\"  # convert the rest of the string to pig latin\n        withlock(lock) do\n            result[i] = \"$rest_of_the_string $first_letter\"  # combine the translated word and first letter into one string\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function operates on a vector of strings, `words`, converting each string to pig latin via separate threads. The pig latin conversion for each string is performed in a thread-safe way by using the shared state `result` in a lock block. \n\nThe code uses `@threads` macro from Julia's Base.Threads module for creating and managing threads, along with functions like `first(word)` to get the first character of a word and string concatenation (`* \"ay\"`). Note that the pig latin conversion is simplified here; in actual use, it would probably involve more rules or even language-specific translation.\n\nThe lock ensures thread safety when multiple threads are modifying the same variable `result`. The lock prevents two threads from simultaneously writing to `result` which can lead to race conditions (unpredictable behavior) if not handled correctly. In this case, a simple reentrant lock is used that allows multiple locks by the same thread.","status":200,"tokens":[373,459],"elapsed":15.888663167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
