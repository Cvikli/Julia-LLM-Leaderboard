When it gets an empty task (signaled by the Queue's Empty exception), it knows that there are no more tasks to process and exits.\n\nIn main, we create 5 threads (adjust this number as necessary for your particular use case) and add a task to each one for each word in our list of words. We then wait for all tasks to complete before we shut down the threads by calling join() on each thread.","status":200,"tokens":[197,540],"elapsed":23.463675834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
