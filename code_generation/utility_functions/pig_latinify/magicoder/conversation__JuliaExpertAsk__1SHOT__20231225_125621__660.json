It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Pig Latin is a language game where each word starts with a consonant and the rest of the word is moved to the end, while still keeping its initial letter. If the first letter is a vowel, just add \"way\" to the end of the word.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n```python\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    import concurrent.futures\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        translations = list(executor.map(_pig_latinify, words))\n    return translations\n\ndef _pig_latinify(word):\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    \n    if word[0].lower() in vowels:\n        return word + 'way'\n    else:\n        first_letter = word[0]\n        remaining_letters = word[1:]\n        return f'{remaining_letters}{first_letter}ay'\n```\nIn the above code, `pig_latinify` is the function that takes a list of words and returns them transformed to Pig Latin. It uses Python's ThreadPoolExecutor from concurrent.futures module to run each transformation on a separate thread. The `_pig_latinify` helper function does the actual work.\n\nThis is just an example. In a real world scenario, you would have more complex rules for Pig Latin (for instance, punctuation should be placed after the transformed word). You might also want to handle words with numbers and special characters differently from English words only.","status":200,"tokens":[109,353],"elapsed":11.093891542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
