It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\npig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nHere's a Python solution to your problem. I am using the threading library for multithreading. \n\n```python\nimport threading\nfrom queue import Queue\n\n# Transformer function to transform string into Pig Latin\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    return f\"{word[1:]}{word[0]}ay\" if word[0] in \"aeiou\" else f\"{word}ay\"\n\nclass WorkerThread(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self, queue):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.queue = queue\n \n    def run(self):\n        while True:\n            word = self.queue.get()\n            if word is None:\n                break\n            print(pig_latinify(word))\n            self.queue.task_done()\n\n# Create a queue to hold our words\nwordsQueue = Queue()\n\n# Start worker threads\nfor i in range(5):  # Number of threads you want to run\n    WorkerThread(wordsQueue).start()\n\n# Put the work in the queue and then wait for it to be done\nfor word in [\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]:\n    wordsQueue.put(word)\n\nwordsQueue.join()  # This will block until all tasks are done\n\n# Stop the threads\nfor i in range(5):\n    wordsQueue.put(None)\n```\nThe `WorkerThread` class is designed to pull work off of a queue and process it using our pig_latinify function, one word at a time. It does this with each thread until there's no more work in the queue (when None is put into the queue). We then wait for all tasks to be done by calling `join()` on our wordsQueue object. \n\nThis script will print out the Pig Latin versions of \"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\" and \"world\". The number \"5\" passed to threading.Thread() means we're creating five threads, which is more than we need since Python can handle multiple threads just fine, but it demonstrates a common idiom for multithreading in Python. You could also use `threading.ThreadPool` instead of manually managing the threads if you want to create as many threads as there are cores on your CPU.","status":200,"tokens":[197,524],"elapsed":17.109897916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
