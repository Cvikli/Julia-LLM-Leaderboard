[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the task in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    function translate(word)\n        if occursin(\"[aeiou]\", word)\n            \"ay\" * word\n        else\n            word = split(word, \"\")\n            word[end] *= \"ay\"\n            join(word, \"\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    Threads.@threads for word in words\n        println(translate(lowercase(word)))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of strings `words` as input. It defines an inner function `translate` that checks whether the first letter of each word is vowel (does not contain [aeiou]). If true, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the word. If false, it splits the word into characters and then appends \"ay\" at the end of every character until it meets a consonant, and then finally joins all these modified characters together. The function is called in parallel for each string `word` in the input vector. \n\nPlease note that the print statement inside the thread is there just to illustrate how the program will output, you might want to remove it or modify according to your needs. Also remember, Julia's Threading capability depends on the number of cores in a machine and might not provide parallelism for very short tasks like this one. \n\nIn terms of the special instructions, there are none provided here, so these guidelines should be followed directly.","status":200,"tokens":[370,339],"elapsed":11.952446417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
