[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Write a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Pig Latin is a language game where you take the first letter of a word, move it to the end of the word and add \"ay\". If a word starts with vowel sounds 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' then just add \"way\" at the end.\n\nHere's an example of how to write a function in Julia that implements this:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    result = Channel{String}()\n    \n    @async begin\n        for string in strings\n            put!(result, pig_latin_transform(string))\n        end\n        close(result)\n    end\n    \n    return [take!(result) for _ in 1:length(strings)]\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(s::String)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    first_char = s[1]\n    \n    if first_char in vowels\n        return string(s * \"way\")\n    else \n        return string(s[2:end] * first_char * \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this implementation, `pig_latinify` receives a list of strings. It opens a new thread that reads from the input strings and puts the transformed strings into a channel. The main thread reads the transformed strings from the channel.\n\nNote: The example doesn't handle multi-word sentences correctly because it treats each word separately, so you might want to modify the `pig_latin_transform` function accordingly if you need that feature.","status":200,"tokens":[70,366],"elapsed":11.035685167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
