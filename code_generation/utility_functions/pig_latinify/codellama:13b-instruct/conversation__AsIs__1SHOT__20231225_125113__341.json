The `to_pig_latin` method is used to transform each word in the chunk into pig latin. Finally, the outputs from all threads are joined and returned as a single output vector.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector contains only ASCII characters, if your input vector contains non-ASCII characters you will need to use a different method for splitting the input and joining the outputs.","status":200,"tokens":[75,481],"elapsed":26.208586666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
