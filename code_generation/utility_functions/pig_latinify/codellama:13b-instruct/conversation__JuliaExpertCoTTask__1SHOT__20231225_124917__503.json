The `remotecall_fetch` function returns the result of the function execution and prints it to the console.\n* We then wrap the entire function call in an `@sync` block to ensure that all threads finish their work before returning.","status":200,"tokens":[205,380],"elapsed":22.040981791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
