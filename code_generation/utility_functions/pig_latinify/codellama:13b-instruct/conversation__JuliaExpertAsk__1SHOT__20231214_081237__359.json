The `pig_latinify` function takes a single argument, which is the input vector of strings.\n\nThe function applies the Pig Latin transformation to each string in the input vector using separate threads created using the `Threads.threadpool` function. Each thread applies the transformation to a single string in parallel.\n\nOnce all threads have finished, we use the `Threads.waitall` function to wait for all threads to complete before returning the transformed strings.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function is a simple implementation of the Pig Latin transformation that removes the first consonant from the input string and adds \"ay\" to the end. This function can be used as a fallback implementation if the `pig_latinify` function encounters any errors or if the input string is too long to fit in the available memory.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector contains only strings of length greater than or equal to 1. If the input vector may contain shorter strings, we may need to modify the `pig_latinify` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[99,544],"elapsed":18.985712542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
