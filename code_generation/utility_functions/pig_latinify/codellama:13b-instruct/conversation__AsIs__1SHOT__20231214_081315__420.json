Here's how it works:\n\n1. It creates a separate thread for each string in the list using the `threading.Thread` class.\n2. In each thread, it calls the `pig_latinize` function with the original string as input and returns the transformed string in Pig Latin.\n3. The `pig_latinize` function gets the original word and its Pig Latin equivalent by using the `string[0].lower()` to get the first letter of the word, and then adding `-way` to the end of the word and lowercasing it.\n4. The `pig_latinify` function waits for all threads to finish using the `for t in threads: t.join()` loop.\n5. Finally, it returns the list of transformed strings in Pig Latin.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```\n# Example usage\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"pig\"]\ntransformed_strings = pig_latinify(strings)\nprint(transformed_strings) # Output: [\"Ay-yip-ee-tah hel-lo\", \"Ay-yip-ee-tah wuhrld\", \"Ay-yip-ee-tah pig\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[53,611],"elapsed":20.794210791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
