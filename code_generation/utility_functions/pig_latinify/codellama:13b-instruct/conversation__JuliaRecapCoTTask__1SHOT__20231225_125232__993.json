[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\n# Julia snippet for pig latin transformer \nfunction pig_latinify(str)::String\n    if isempty(str)\n        return str\n    end\n    firstChar = first(str)\n    restChars = str[2:end]\n    result = string(restChars, firstChar, \"ay\")\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNote that this snippet uses the `isempty` function to check if a string is empty and returns it as-is in that case. It also uses the `first` and `last` functions to get the first character of the input string and the rest of the characters, respectively. Finally, it creates a new string with the reversed order of the characters using the `string` function and concatenates the result with \"ay\" to form pig latin.\n\nTo use this snippet in a vector of strings, you can create a `Threads.@threads for` loop that iterates over each string and applies the `pig_latinify` function to it:\n```julia\n# Example usage\nstrs = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\n@time Threads.@threads for str in strs\n    pig_latinify(str)\nend\n```\nThis will create a vector of threads that each apply the `pig_latinify` function to one string in the input vector. The `@time` macro is used to measure the time it takes for all the threads to finish executing.","status":200,"tokens":[381,326],"elapsed":20.863320042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
