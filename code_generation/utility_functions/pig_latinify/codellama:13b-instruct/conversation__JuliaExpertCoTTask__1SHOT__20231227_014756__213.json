It then iterates over each word in the vector and submits it to the thread pool for processing. Each thread processes the word independently, applying the transformation to each syllable in the word. Finally, the results are joined back together with spaces to form the final pig latin string.\n\nNote that this solution uses the `spawn` macro to submit tasks to the thread pool. The `yield()` function is used to wait for a task to complete before continuing with the next iteration.","status":200,"tokens":[205,568],"elapsed":42.106536,"_type":"aimessage"}]
