It uses a separate thread for each word in the input string, which allows it to perform multiple translations simultaneously. The `pig_latinify_word` function is used to transform individual words using the Pig Latin algorithm.\n\nYou can test this code by running:\n```julia\nstr = \"hello world\"\nprintln(pig_latinify(str)) # Output: \"helloway orldway\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[78,450],"elapsed":24.847227167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
