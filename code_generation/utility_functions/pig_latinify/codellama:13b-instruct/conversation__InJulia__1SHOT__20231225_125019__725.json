We then iterate over each character and change it to pig latin using the `pig_latinify_character` function. Finally, we wait for all threads to finish and join the modified characters back into a string.\n\nNote that this implementation uses the `Threads` module from Julia's standard library to create separate threads for each character. This allows us to perform multiple operations in parallel, which can significantly speed up the processing of large inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[78,473],"elapsed":25.712024542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
