[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nFirst, let's create a `pig_latinify` function that takes in an array of strings and returns a vector of pig latin translations. We can use the `@threads` macro from the `Threads` module to parallelize the computation.\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(arr::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(arr))\n    @threads for (i, word) in enumerate(arr)\n        result[i] = pig_latin(word)\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nNext, we'll define the `pig_latin` function that converts a single string to pig latin. We can use regular expressions to match words that start with a vowel and replace them with the corresponding pig latin translation.\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)::String\n    if startswith(word, r\"^[aeiou]\")\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nFinally, let's test our `pig_latinify` function on a sample array of strings.\n```julia\narr = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"goodbye\"]\nresult = pig_latinify(arr)\nprintln.(result) # prints: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"oodbyegay\"]\n```\nNote that this solution uses multiple threads to parallelize the computation, but it does not guarantee that the order of words in the output array will be the same as the input array. If you need to preserve the order of the words, you can use a different approach such as using a queue or a channel to coordinate the work between the threads.","status":200,"tokens":[378,419],"elapsed":26.298503583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
