Here's my implementation of `pig_latinify` in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    # Use parallelism to apply transformation to each string in parallel\n    # This is important for performance, as we don't want to block the main thread\n    # Using Parallel and its equivalent in Julia (ThreadPool)\n    @parallel for i in 1:length(strs)\n        strs[i] = translate_pig_latin(strs[i])\n    end\nend\n\nfunction translate_pig_latin(str)\n    # Function to apply pig latino transformation to a string\n    # Step 1: move first consonant of each word to the end of the word\n    # Step 2: add \"ay\" to the end of the word\n    # Example: \"strong\" becomes \"strongay\"\n    return regexreplace(str, r\"^([bcdfghjklmnpqrstwxyz])\\\\$\", \" \\\\1 ay\")\nend\n```\nLet me explain how this code works:\n\n1. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as input.\n2. We use parallelism to apply the transformation to each string in parallel, without blocking the main thread. We do this by using the `@parallel` macro, which creates a separate thread for each iteration of the loop.\n3. Inside each thread, we call the `translate_pig_latin` function to actually perform the pig latino transformation on the input string. This function takes a single string as input and returns the transformed string.\n4. The `translate_pig_latin` function works by moving the first consonant of each word to the end of the word, and then adding \"ay\" to the end of the word. For example, \"strong\" becomes \"strongay\".\n5. Finally, we return the transformed string from the `translate_pig_latin` function, which is then added to the original vector of strings in the main thread.\n\nSo, when you call `pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])`, it will apply the pig latino transformation to each string in parallel, and return the transformed vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[187,518],"elapsed":19.268155792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
