[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

In this function, each word is processed in its own thread. The words are first split into syllables and then these syllables are rearranged according to the rules of pig latin: the first consonant or consonant cluster of each word is moved to the end of the word and an \"ay\" is added at the end.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    # Threaded processing of words\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = lowercase(words[i])  # Convert to lower case\n        syllables = split_into_syllables(word)\n        pig_latin_word = convert_to_pig_latin(syllables)\n        result[i] = pig_latin_word\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n\nfunction split_into_syllables(word::String)::Vector{SubString}\n    syllables = Vector{SubString}()\n    # Implement your syllable splitting logic here\n    # This is just a placeholder, you should replace it with actual syllable splitting code\n    for char in word\n        push!(syllables, SubString(word, 1, 1))\n    end\n    return syllables\nend\n\nfunction convert_to_pig_latin(syllables::Vector{SubString})::String\n    first_syllable = shift!(syllables)  # Remove and return the first element from syllables\n    pig_latin_word = string(first_syllable, \"ay\")  # Append \"ay\" to the first consonant/cluster\n    for syllable in syllables\n        append!(pig_latin_word, syllable)\n    end\n    return pig_latin_word\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation uses Julia's built-in multithreading capabilities. The `@threads` macro is used to parallelize the processing of each word in the input vector.\n\nNote: The `split_into_syllables` function is a placeholder and needs to be replaced by actual syllable splitting logic. Syllable splitting is language-dependent and thus requires a more sophisticated implementation for real-world use.","status":200,"tokens":[381,555],"elapsed":78.832983916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
