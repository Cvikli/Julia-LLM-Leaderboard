X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

I'm ready to help you with your Julia language task. Please provide the code for `pig_latinify` function and any special instructions you have.\n\nHere are my problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Vector operations (`[:])\n\t* Threading (`@`)\n\t* Functional programming (`->`)\n\t* Multiple dispatch (`::`)\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Create a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings.\n\t* Iterate over each string in parallel using threads.\n\t* Apply the Pig Latin transformation to each string.\n3. Double-check solution correctness:\n\t* Use type checking and linting tools to ensure the code is syntactically correct and follows best practices.\n\t* Test the function with a variety of inputs to ensure it produces the expected output.\n\nBased on your instructions, I will prioritize any special requirements you have and use general type annotations to avoid being too restrictive. I will also use reserved names and distinguished Julia syntax from Python where appropriate. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help!","status":200,"tokens":[11,264],"elapsed":9.466592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
