[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Threads` module to create threads for each iteration. Here is a possible implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        results[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function creates a new vector `results` to store the transformed words. The `Threads.@threads` macro will create a separate thread for each iteration in the loop, and each thread applies the `pig_latin` function to a word from the input vector.\n\nNow we just need to implement the `pig_latin` function that transforms a single string to pig latin:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n    \n    return \"$rest_of_word$first_letter\" * \"ay\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes the first letter of the input word, then appends that letter to the end of the remaining characters in the word. Finally, it appends \"ay\" to form the pig latin word.\n\nTo use these functions, simply pass a vector of strings:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)  # Outputs: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[384,392],"elapsed":57.56739325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
