X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

First, you need to load the `Threads` package by `@everywhere using Threads`. Then you can use the macro `@threads` for parallelization. Here's a sample solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{T}) where {T <: AbstractString}\n    result = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        \n        if first_letter == 'a' || first_letter == 'e' || first_letter == 'i' || first_letter == 'o' || first_letter == 'u'\n            result[i] = \"$wordway\"\n        else\n            result[i] = word[2:end]*first_letter*\"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return result\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, the pig latin rule is applied to each element in `words` vector. If the first letter of a word is a vowel, it appends \"way\" to the end of the word, otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and appends \"ay\". The result is stored in the `result` array.\n\nThis function can be called like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"piglatin\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```\n\nAnd it will return a new vector with all words converted to pig latin: `[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"iglatinpay\"]`. \n\nNote that the `@threads` macro is available on Julia 1.3 and later versions, and multi-threading support depends on the underlying system's capabilities.","status":200,"tokens":[381,424],"elapsed":61.708070416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
