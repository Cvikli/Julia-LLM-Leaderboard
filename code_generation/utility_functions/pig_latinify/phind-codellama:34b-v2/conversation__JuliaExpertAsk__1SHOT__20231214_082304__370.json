It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's an example implementation of a `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n```julia\n# Function to transform a vector of strings to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify(v)\n    # Iterate over each string in the vector using threads\n    Threads.map(v, &pig_latin)\nend\n\n# Function to apply Pig Latin transformation to a single string\nfunction pig_latin(s)\n    # Check if the input string is empty or contains only whitespace\n    if length(s) == 0 || all(c -> !isalpha(c), s)\n        return s\n    else\n        # Otherwise, replace each letter with its Pig Latin equivalent\n        out = []\n        for c in s\n            if isalpha(c)\n                out += [c -> (c - 'a' + 'A'), c]\n            else\n                out += [c -> (c - 'a' + 'A')]\n        end\n        return concat(out)\n    end\nend\n```\nHere, `pig_latinify` takes a vector of strings as input and applies the Pig Latin transformation to each string using `Threads.map`. The `pig_latin` function is defined inside the `pig_latinify` function, and it takes a single string as input. It checks if the input string is empty or contains only whitespace, and if so, returns the original string. Otherwise, it replaces each letter with its Pig Latin equivalent using the formula `(c - 'a' + 'A')`. The resulting Pig Latinized string is returned as a list of strings, which is then concatenated into a single string using `concat`.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector contains only strings of ASCII characters. If your input data contains non-ASCII characters, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[99,423],"elapsed":14.678390291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
