It initializes the `result` vector to store the transformed words.\n2. It defines a nested function `to_pig_latin()` that takes a single word as input and returns its pig latin equivalent.\n3. It creates a thread for each word in the input vector, where each thread applies the `to_pig_latin` function to a word and stores the result in the corresponding position of the `result` vector.\n4. It waits for all threads to finish their tasks using the `wait()` function.\n5. Finally, it returns the `result` vector containing the pig latin equivalents of all words in the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[120,417],"elapsed":54.747500834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
