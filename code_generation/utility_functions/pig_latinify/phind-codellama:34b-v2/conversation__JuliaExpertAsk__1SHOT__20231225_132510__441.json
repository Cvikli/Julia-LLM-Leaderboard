The `Threads.@threads` macro will cause the loop that applies the `pig_latin` function to each word to run on separate threads, one per available CPU thread. This can potentially give a performance boost if you are translating many words at once and your computer has multiple cores or threads.\n\nThe `pig_latin` function itself checks if the first character of the provided string is a letter (either uppercase or lowercase). If it is, it moves that letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". If the first character is not a letter, it returns the original word unchanged.","status":200,"tokens":[120,333],"elapsed":43.522266584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
