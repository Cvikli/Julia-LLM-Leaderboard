It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple Python program using the built-in threading library to apply the pig latin transformation on a list of strings.\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    def transform_word(word):\n        first_letter = word[0]\n        return word[1:] + first_letter + 'ay'\n    \n    threads = []\n    result = []\n\n    for word in words:\n        thread = threading.Thread(target=result.append, args=(transform_word(word),))\n        thread.start()\n        threads.append(thread)\n    \n    for thread in threads:\n        thread.join()\n\n    return result\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a list of words as input and outputs a list of the words transformed into pig latin. The transformation itself, which moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends 'ay', is done by the nested `transform_word` function. \n\nFor each word in the input list, we create a new thread that will append the transformed word to the result list. We start all those threads and then wait for them to finish using `thread.join()`. Finally, we return the resulting list of words.\n\nPlease note that this solution is meant for learning purposes and might not be optimal for production environments because starting a thread is a relatively expensive operation and Python has a limit on the number of threads it can create. For large lists of words, you might want to use a different approach, like applying the transformation in chunks or using a pool of worker threads.","status":200,"tokens":[78,355],"elapsed":45.477990875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
