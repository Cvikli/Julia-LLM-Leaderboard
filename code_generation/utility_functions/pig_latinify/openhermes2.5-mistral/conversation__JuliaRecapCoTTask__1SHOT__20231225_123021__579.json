[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We'll be using the `Threads.jl` package, which is part of the standard library. \n\nWe start by defining a function that converts a single string to Pig Latin:\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(word)\n    first = word[1] # First character in the word\n    rest = word[2:end] # Rest of the word\n    \n    if isletter(first) && !ismarker(first)\n        new_first = string('y', lowercase(first)) # Move the first letter to end and add 'ay'\n        return string(new_first, rest) * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word # If the word starts with non-letter or marker, return as is\n    end\nend\n```\nNow we can define the `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    threads = [@spawnat i+1 pig_latinify(words[i]) for i in eachindex(words)] # Create separate threads for each word\n    result = [wait(t) for t in threads] # Wait for each thread to finish and store results\n    return result\nend\n```\nIn the `pig_latinify` function, we're creating a separate thread for each word using `@spawnat`, which runs the `pig_latinify(words[i])` on a separate thread. The index `i+1` ensures that the threads run concurrently instead of sequentially. After creating all the threads, we wait for them to finish with `wait(t)` and store their results in the same order.\n\nThis implementation should be efficient as it leverages Julia's multiple dispatch, built-in threading capabilities, and avoids unnecessary data copying.","status":200,"tokens":[379,472],"elapsed":16.463878541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
