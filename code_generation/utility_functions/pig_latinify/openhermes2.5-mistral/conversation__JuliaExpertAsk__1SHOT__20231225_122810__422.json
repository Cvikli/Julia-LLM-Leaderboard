Here's an implementation:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    Threads.@threads for str in strings\n        transform_to_pig_latin(str)\n    end\nend\n\n# Helper function to convert string to pig latin\nfunction transform_to_pig_latin(str::String)\n    first_letter = lowercase(str[1])\n    if first_letter == 'a' || first_letter == 'e' || first_letter == 'i' || first_letter == 'o' || first_letter == 'u'\n        return str * \"way\"\n    else\n        return string('y', str[2:end], lowercase(first_letter), \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis `pig_latinify` function will iterate over each string in the input vector and convert it to pig latin using the `transform_to_pig_latin` helper function. The transformation is performed in parallel using separate threads for each iteration.","status":200,"tokens":[112,279],"elapsed":8.84315,"_type":"aimessage"}]
