Here is a basic implementation:\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    tasks = []\n    for s in strings\n        push!(tasks, @spawn at_thread(() -> convert_to_pig_latin(s)))\n    end\n    [fetch(task) for task in tasks]\nend\n\nfunction convert_to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = lowercase(word[1])\n    if first_letter == 'a' || first_letter == 'e' || first_letter == 'i' || first_letter == 'o' || first_letter == 'u'\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        return join([word[2:end], lowercase(first_letter), \"ay\"])\n    end\nend\n```\nThis code defines a function `pig_latinify` that takes in a vector of strings and applies the `convert_to_pig_latin` transformation on each string using multi-threading. The `convert_to_pig_latin` function checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel, and converts the word to pig latin accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[112,316],"elapsed":9.991831167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
