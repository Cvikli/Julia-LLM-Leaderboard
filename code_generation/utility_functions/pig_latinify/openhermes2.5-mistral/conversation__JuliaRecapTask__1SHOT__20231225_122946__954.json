[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The Julia language has built-in support for multi-threading via the `Threads.jl` package. We will also leverage the standard library functions for string manipulation.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs)\n    threads = Map(string -> PigLatin(string), strs)\n    return [fetch(t) for t in threads]\nend\n\nstruct PigLatin\n    str::String\nend\n\nfunction PigLatin(str::String)\n    # Add 'way' to the end of the first letter of each word and move the first letter to the end.\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    pig_latin_words = map(word -> (word[2:end] * string('a') * char(first(word)),), words)\n    return join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\nend\n```\n\nLet's go through this code step by step.\n\nFirst, we define a function `pig_latinify` that takes in an array of strings `strs`. This function will spawn new threads to process each string independently.\n\nNext, we create a map of the input strings to new `PigLatin` tasks for each string in the input array using the `Threads.jl` package:\n```julia\nthreads = Map(string -> PigLatin(string), strs)\n```\nThis creates a list of threads, where each thread is responsible for converting one string to pig latin.\n\nThen, we fetch the results from these threads and return them in an array:\n```julia\nreturn [fetch(t) for t in threads]\n```\nThe `fetch()` function returns the result of a thread, so by applying it to all threads and returning the resulting array, we get the pig latin version of each input string.\n\nTo define how each string should be converted to pig latin, we create a `PigLatin` struct that holds the original string:\n```julia\nstruct PigLatin\n    str::String\nend\n```\nThe `PigLatin` constructor converts a string to pig latin. It does this by adding 'way' to the end of the first letter of each word and moving the first letter to the end:\n```julia\nfunction PigLatin(str::String)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    pig_latin_words = map(word -> (word[2:end] * string('a') * char(first(word)),), words)\n    return join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\nend\n```\nThis function splits the input string into a list of words, then applies a transformation to each word. The transformed words are then joined back together with spaces between them to form the final pig latin version of the original string.\n\nNow you can call `pig_latinify` on an array of strings and it will return an array with the pig latin versions of those strings, processed in parallel by multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[377,742],"elapsed":25.398237166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
