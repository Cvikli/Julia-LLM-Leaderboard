[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'll provide the solution in two parts: one for the pig latin transform function, and another for creating separate threads. \n\nPart 1: Pig Latin Transform Function\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(s::AbstractString)\n    first_char = lowercase(first(s))\n    \n    if first_char == 'a' || first_char == 'e' || first_char == 'i' || \n        first_char == 'o' || first_char == 'u'\n        return s * \"way\"\n    else\n        return string(\"ay\", uppercase(first(s)), substr(s, 2))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nPart 2: Threading Function\n\nTo handle the threads, we can make use of Julia's built-in `Threads.@threads` macro for parallel execution. However, it doesn't operate on vectors directly but on ranges. Therefore, we need to transform the vector into a range first:\n\n```julia\nfunction threaded_pig_latinify(v::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(v)\n        v[i] = pig_latinify(v[i])\n    end\n    return v\nend\n```\n\nPlease provide the input vector of strings and any additional special instructions to use this solution.","status":200,"tokens":[379,318],"elapsed":11.593764291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
