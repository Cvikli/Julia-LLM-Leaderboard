X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Based on the problem statement and guidelines provided, here is a systematic approach to solving the task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* `Base. threads` for creating separate threads for each string in the vector.\n\t* `Plain` type for working with plain strings.\n\t* `String` type for working with strings.\n\t* `Vector` type for working with vectors of strings.\n\t* ` Threads` module for managing multiple threads.\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Create a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of Plain strings in pig latin format.\n\t* Use the `Base. threads` module to create separate threads for each string in the input vector.\n\t* In each thread, use a loop to iterate over the characters of the string and apply the pig latin transformation.\n\t* After transforming each string, return it in the Plain type.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Use the `is_latin` function from the `String` module to check if a given string is in Latin format.\n\t* Use the `Plain` type to compare the output of the `pig_latinify` function with the expected output.\n\nHere is some sample code that implements the `pig_latinify` function:\n```julia\n# Function to apply pig latin transformation to a string\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    # Create separate threads for each string in the input vector\n    threads = Base.threads(nThreads=length(strings))\n    \n    # Run each thread separately, applying the pig latin transformation\n    results = Threads.map(threads, strings, \n                   function(string) begin\n                        # Iterate over the characters of the string\n                        for char in string\n                            # Apply the pig latin transformation\n                            if char >= 'a' && char <= 'z'\n                                char = (char - 'a' + 'y') % 26 + 'a'\n                            end\n                        end\n                        return string\n                    end)\n    \n    # Return the output of each thread\n    return results\nend\n```\nIn this code, we define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of Plain strings in pig latin format. We use the `Base. threads` module to create separate threads for each string in the input vector, and use the `Threads.map` function to apply the pig latin transformation to each thread separately. Finally, we return the output of each thread as a Plain string.\n\nI hope this helps!
