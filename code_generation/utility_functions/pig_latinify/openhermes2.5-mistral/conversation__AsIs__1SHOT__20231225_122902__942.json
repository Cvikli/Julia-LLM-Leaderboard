[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"Write a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve this, you can use Python's `concurrent.futures` module to execute each string transformation on a separate thread. Here's an implementation of the `pig_latinify` function that applies Pig Latin transformations concurrently using threads:\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport threading\n\ndef pig_latinify(strings):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        results = executor.map(lambda s: _pig_latinify(s), strings)\n    return list(results)\n\ndef _pig_latinify(word):\n    word_threads = threading.current_thread().name\n    if not word or word == 'quay' or word[0].lower() not in 'aeiou':\n        return word + word_threads\n    else:\n        first_letter = word[0]\n        new_word = word[1:] + first_letter + 'ay' + word_threads\n        return new_word\n```\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a list of strings as input, applies the Pig Latin transformation to each string using the `_pig_latinify` function, and returns a new list with the transformed strings. The `_pig_latinify` function is responsible for performing the actual Pig Latin transformation on a given word while handling threading issues.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input strings are in English and do not contain any non-Latin characters that might cause issues during the transformation process. You may need to modify or extend the `_pig_latinify` function based on your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[68,379],"elapsed":11.698928916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
