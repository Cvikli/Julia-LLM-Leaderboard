Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{AbstractString})\n    threads = [Atomic{Nothing} for i in 1:length(strings)] # Atomic for thread safety\n    results = [Atomic{AbstractString}(missing) for i in 1:length(strings)] # Atomic for thread safety\n\n    function worker(thread_id::Int, input_string::AbstractString)\n        word_first = first(lowercase(input_string))\n        if word_first in [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n            result = \"$input_stringay\"\n        else\n            result = \"$input_string$word_firstay\"\n        end\n        results[thread_id][] = result # store result in atomic for thread safety\n    end\n\n    for (tid, str) in enumerate(strings)\n        Threads.@spawn worker(tid, str)\n        while !isassigned(threads[tid])\n            sleep(0.1) # prevent CPU hogging, adjust sleep duration as needed\n        end\n        strings[tid] = threads[tid][] # get the result from atomic\n    end\n\n    return strings\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function first initializes an array of `Atomic{Nothing}` and an array of `Atomic{AbstractString}`, both with length equal to the number of input strings. These arrays are used for thread safety when storing results from each worker thread.\n\nInside the `worker` function, it first checks if the input string's first letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u). If so, it appends \"ay\" to the end of the string; otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and then appends \"ay\". The result is stored in an atomic variable for thread safety.\n\nIn the main `pig_latinify` function, a worker thread is spawned for each input string using the `Threads.@spawn` macro. It then waits until the result from the worker thread is available by checking the atomic variable's assignment status. Once the result is available, it retrieves and replaces the original string in the input array with the pig latin version.\n\nFinally, the function returns the modified strings array with all strings transformed to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[377,593],"elapsed":20.550870208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
