The `join` method is used to wait for all threads to finish before returning the transformed strings.\n\nNote that this implementation uses the `threading` module to create separate threads for each string in the input list, but it does not handle any race conditions or synchronization issues. If you need to transform a large number of strings, you may want to consider using a more advanced parallelism library like `concurrent.futures`.","status":200,"tokens":[53,523],"elapsed":17.607794166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
