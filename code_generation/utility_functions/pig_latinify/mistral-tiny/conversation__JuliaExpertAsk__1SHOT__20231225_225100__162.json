It uses the `Threads.jl` library to perform each string transformation in a separate thread. The `pig_latinify` function initializes an empty vector `results` to store the results of each thread. It then iterates through each string in the input vector and starts a new thread for each string. The threads are stored in an array `threads`. After all threads are started, the function waits for each thread to finish and then adds its result to the `results` vector. The final output is the `results` vector containing the pig latin transformed strings.","status":200,"tokens":[107,393],"elapsed":3.408996375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
