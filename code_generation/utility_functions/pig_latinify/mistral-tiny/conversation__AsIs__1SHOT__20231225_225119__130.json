However, Rust's standard library doesn't support creating threads from iterators directly. Instead, you can use a vector of `Thread` and a vector of `Arc<String>` to accomplish this.\n\nHere's a basic implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```rust\nuse std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};\nuse std::thread;\n\nfn pig_latinify(string: &str) -> String {\n    let mut words = string.split_whitespace();\n\n    let mut transformed_words = Vec::new();\n    while let Some(word) = words.next() {\n        transformed_words.push(pig_latin_word(word));\n    }\n\n    transformed_words.join(\" \")\n}\n\nfn pig_latin_word(word: &str) -> String {\n    let first = word.chars().next().unwrap();\n    let suffix = &word[1..];\n\n    if word.len() <= 2 {\n        return word.to_string();\n    }\n\n    format!(\"{}{}\", suffix, first)\n}\n\nfn threaded_pig_latinify(strings: Vec<String>, threads: usize) {\n    let strings_arc = Arc::new(Mutex::new(strings));\n\n    let mut threads = Vec::new();\n\n    for _ in 0..threads {\n        let strings_clone = strings_arc.clone();\n        let thread = thread::spawn(move || {\n            let mut strings = strings_clone.lock().unwrap();\n            while let Some(string) = strings.drain(0) {\n                let transformed_string = Arc::new(pig_latinify(&string));\n                println!(\"Thread processed: {}\", transformed_string);\n            }\n        });\n        threads.push(thread);\n    }\n\n    for thread in threads {\n        thread.join().unwrap();\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let input_strings = vec![\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"];\n    let num_threads = 3;\n\n    threaded_pig_latinify(input_strings, num_threads);\n}\n```\n\nThe `threaded_pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and a number of threads. It uses a mutex to share the input vector between threads and processes each string in a separate thread. Note that this example does not return any result and just prints the transformed strings in each thread. You can modify the function to collect and return the transformed strings if needed.\n\nKeep in mind that this example doesn't check if the number of threads is greater than the number of strings, so you may want to add error handling or checks for that. Also, consider if using threads for such a simple transformation is worth the complexity.","status":200,"tokens":[63,700],"elapsed":5.941257834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
