The `rayon` library will help you parallelize the iteration over strings using threads. Here's a step-by-step guide to get started.\n\nFirst, add `rayon` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nrayon = \"1.5.1\"\n```\n\nNext, define the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```rust\nuse rayon::prelude::*;\nuse std::thread;\n\nfn pig_latinify(s: &str) -> String {\n    let first_letter = s.chars().next().unwrap();\n    let pig_latin = match first_letter {\n        'a'..='z' => format!(\"{}-way{} {}\", s[1..], first_letter, s[1..]),\n        'qu' => format!(\"{}-qu-ay{} {}\", &s[2..], first_letter, s[2..]),\n        'x' => format!(\"{}-xi-x{} {}\", &s[2..], first_letter, s[2..]),\n        'y' => format!(\"{}-y{}-ay{} {}\", &s[1..], first_letter, s[1..]),\n        _ => s.to_string(),\n    };\n    pig_latin\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let strings = vec![\"apple\", \"banana\", \"quince\", \"xyz\", \"alpha\", \"yellow\"];\n    let handles = strings.par_iter().map(|s| {\n        thread::spawn(move || {\n            let pig_latin = pig_latinify(*s);\n            println!(\"{}\", pig_latin);\n        })\n    });\n    for handle in handles {\n        handle.join().unwrap();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function checks the first character of a string and converts it to pig latin accordingly. The `main` function defines a vector of strings and uses `rayon` to parallelize the iteration over strings using threads. Each string is passed to the `pig_latinify` function and printed to the console.\n\nKeep in mind that this code might not compile without proper error handling and thread cleanup. To make it production-ready, you should handle errors and wait for all threads to finish before exiting the program.","status":200,"tokens":[63,593],"elapsed":5.020876375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
