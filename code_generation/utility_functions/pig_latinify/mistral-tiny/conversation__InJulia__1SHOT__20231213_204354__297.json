Here's an example of how you can achieve that:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(str::String)\n    first_letter::Char = str[1]\n    vowels::Vector{Char} = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    consonants::Vector{Char} = char.(split(str, [first_letter]))[2:end]\n\n    if isempty(consonants) || isempty(str) || first_letter âˆ‰ vowels\n        return str\n    end\n\n    return string(consonants, first_letter, \"ay\")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    threads = Threads.Thread[]\n\n    for str in strings\n        push!(threads, Threads.@spawn pig_latin(str))\n    end\n\n    results = Threads.collect!(threads)\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` accepts a vector of strings and returns a new vector with the pig latin transformed strings. The `pig_latin` function accepts a single string and returns the pig latin transformed string. Both functions use the `Threads` module to spawn a new thread for each string transformation.\n\nKeep in mind that the example above might not be the most efficient way to parallelize the pig latin transformation since the threads have to wait for each other to finish before the results can be collected. However, it demonstrates the basic concept of using threads to perform the transformation on multiple strings in parallel.\n\nIf you want a more efficient parallelization, you might want to consider using a work queue or a task queue like `TaskQueue` or `PooledWorkQueues` instead.","status":200,"tokens":[66,442],"elapsed":5.892529125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
