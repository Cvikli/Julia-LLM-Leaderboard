Here's an example of how you might implement it:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(str::String)\n    first_letter = lowercase(str[1])\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", 'u']\n\n    if iselement(vowels, first_letter)\n        return string(\"way\", str[2:end])\n    else\n        return string(str[2:end], string(\"ay\", lowercase(str[1])))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    threads = Vector{ThreadId}()\n    results = Vector{String}()\n\n    for str in strings\n        push!(threads, @spawnat thread() pig_latin(str))\n    end\n\n    for thread in threads\n        push!(results, fetch(thread))\n        wait(thread)\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes a single string as an argument and converts it to pig latin. The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as an argument and applies the pig latin transformation to each string using separate threads.\n\nKeep in mind that this example might not be the most efficient solution, as it creates a new thread for each string transformation. If you have a large number of strings, you might want to consider using a thread pool or a different concurrency mechanism to improve performance.","status":200,"tokens":[66,381],"elapsed":3.179312875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
