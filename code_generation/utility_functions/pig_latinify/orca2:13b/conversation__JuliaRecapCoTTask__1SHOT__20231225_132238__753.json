For example, `Threads`, `map`, and `join` functions can be used to parallelize the iteration over a vector of strings and apply the pig latin transformation.\n- Solve the Task. The main idea is to use `thread` function to create a thread for each element in the input vector, and then use `pig_latinify` function to transform each string. Then, use `map` and `join` functions to collect the transformed strings and return them as a vector.\n- Double-check that the solution is correct by testing it with some sample inputs and comparing the output with the expected results.\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the `pig_latinify` function:\n\nfunction pig_latinify(string::AbstractString)\n  # split the string into words using whitespace as a delimiter\n  words = split(string, \"\")\n  # initialize an empty vector to store the transformed words\n  result = Vector{AbstractString}()\n  # loop over each word in the input vector\n  for word in words\n    # use the thread function to create a new thread for this word\n    thread = thread()\n    # apply the pig latin transformation to the word using an anonymous function\n    word_pig = (x -> x * \"-\" * substr(x, nchar(x) - 2))(word)\n    # join the transformed word with a space to the result vector\n    result = hcat(result, join([word_pig]))\n    # wait for the thread to finish\n    join(thread)\n  end\n  # return the result vector as the output of the function\n  return result\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(vector::Vector{AbstractString})\n  # use the map and join functions to apply the pig latin transformation to each element in the input vector\n  result = join(map(x -> pig_latinify(x), vector))\n  # return the result vector as the output of the function\n  return result\nend\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ?
