Create a function called `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as an input.\n2. Create a thread pool with the number of threads equal to the length of the input vector.\n3. Loop through each string in the input vector and use it as a key in a dictionary to store the index of the first character, the second character, and whether it is uppercase or not.\n4. For each string, reverse the order of its characters and concatenate them with a space to form the pig latin version of the string.\n5. Append the pig latin version of the string to a result vector.\n6. Return the result vector.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```julia\nusing ThreadPool, Dates\nconst NUM_THREADS = length(arg2)\nthreads = ThreadPool(NUM_THREADS)\nresult = Vector{String}(undef, length(arg2))\nfor i in 1:length(arg2), t in threads\n    first, second, isup = arg2[i], arg2[i], arg2[i] >= 'A' && arg2[i] <= 'Z'\n    pig_latin_version = reverse(string(first * second * (isup ?
