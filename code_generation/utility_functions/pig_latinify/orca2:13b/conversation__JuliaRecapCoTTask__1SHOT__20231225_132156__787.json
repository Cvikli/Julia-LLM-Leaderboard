I am a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems. Here are the steps I will follow to solve your task:  1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task. 2. Solve the task. 3. Double-check that the solution is correct.  Before I start, let me remind you of some key aspects of the Julia language. You can use variables, control structures, functions, anonymous functions, arrays, slicing, tuples, namedtuples, dictionaries, and string interpolation. You should prefer the standard libraries of Julia and avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. You should also use general type annotations like Number or AbstractString to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types. You should also know that some names are reserved in Julia, such as begin, end, and function. Julia is different from Python in having one-based indexing and multiple dispatch.  If you have any special instructions, please let me know. Otherwise, I will proceed with the steps.","status":200,"tokens":[376,236],"elapsed":15.93075225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
