X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Multithreading with `Threads.jl` package\n   - Function definition\n   - Vector operations\n   - String manipulation\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\nFirst, install and import the necessary package using `]add Threads`.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = str[1]\n    consonants = [\"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n\n    if isempty(str) || any(c -> c ∈ vowels, str[1:2])\n        return str\n    end\n\n    if first_letter ∈ consonants\n        return string(\"$(str[2:end])\", first_letter, \"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(\"$(str[2:end])\", \"$(first_letter)way\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_threaded(strings::Vector{AbstractString})\n    threads = Threads.Thread[]\n    results = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(threads))\n    for i in 1:length(strings)\n        push!(threads, Threads.@spawnat(nothing, pig_latinify, strings[i]))\n    end\n\n    for thread in threads\n        result = take!(results)\n        pop!(threads)\n        push!(result, thread.val)\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Make sure the `pig_latinify()` function works as expected for individual strings\n   - Test the `pig_latin_threaded()` function with multiple inputs\n\nIf all tests pass, the solution should be correct according to the given problem statement and special instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[372,518],"elapsed":31.008836292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
