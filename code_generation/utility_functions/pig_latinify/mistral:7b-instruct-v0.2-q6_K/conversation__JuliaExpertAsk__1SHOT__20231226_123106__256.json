Here is a simple example:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::String)\n    if occursin(r\"^[aeiou](.*)$\", str) # Check if string starts with vowel\n        return String(join([String(split(str, '')[2:end]), \"way\"])) * String(split(str, '')[1])\n    else\n        first_char = take!(split(str, ''))\n        rest_chars = drop(split(str, ''), 1)\n        return string(drop(rest_chars, 1), first_char, \"ay\") * String(first_char)\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_threaded(strings::Vector{String})\n    threads = Vector{Thread}(undef, length(strings))\n\n    for (i, str) in enumerate(strings)\n        push!(threads, Threads.@spawn pig_latinify($str))\n    end\n\n    results = [Threads.wait(threads) for _ in threads]\n    return [result for thread in results]\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a given string into pig latin, and a higher-level `pig_latin_threaded` function that applies it to multiple strings concurrently using separate threads. Note that error handling or other edge cases are not considered in this example, but can be easily added if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[105,386],"elapsed":21.195033208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
