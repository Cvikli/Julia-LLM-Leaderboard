X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Recall Julia snippets for this task:\n   - Define and apply functions to vectors\n   - Create and use anonymous functions (lambdas) for threading\n   - Use multi-threading with Julia's Base.Threads module\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(str::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = lowercase(first(split(str, ''))[1])\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n\n    if iselement(vowels, first_letter)\n        return string(\"$(split(str, '')[2:])\", first_letter, \"ay\")\n    else\n        return string(\"$(split(str, '')[2:])\", first_letter * \"way\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{AbstractString})\n    threads = Array{Thread}(length(strings))\n    results = Vector{String}()\n\n    for (i, str) in enumerate(strings)\n        threads[i] = Thread(lambda(s) do pig_latin(s), end, str)\n        push!(results, strings[i])\n    end\n\n    for thread in threads\n        wait(thread)\n        result = thread.res\n        push!(results, result)\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function accepts a vector of strings and applies pig latin transformation to each string using separate threads. The implementation uses anonymous functions (lambdas) for threading, and the `wait` function is used to synchronize the execution order of threads. The results are stored in an array `results`, which is eventually returned by the function.\n\nMake sure that your Julia environment has the latest version of Julia installed and test the code with various inputs to ensure it works correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[372,488],"elapsed":29.18174175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
