To simulate this scenario in real-life, consider yourself as a Robotics Engineer working on developing an AI-based robot that can transform sentences into Pig Latin using a similar approach. \n\nThe task is to program a function `translate` which takes a sentence (as string) and converts it to pig latin by changing the first consonant cluster of each word in the sentence to 'ay'. The remaining part of the word remains intact. If a word starts with a vowel, then simply add \"way\" at the end of the word. \n\nHere's a hint: You can start by splitting the sentence into words and apply `translate` function on every individual word.\n\nQuestion: What would be your approach to solve this problem? Write a code snippet that can demonstrate your solution.\n\n\nAs an AI and Robotics Engineer, you first need to understand the problem statement thoroughly. The problem is about programming a pig latin translator for sentences given as strings. You need to break down the sentence into individual words, process them one by one, and convert each word into Pig Latin based on certain rules. \n\n\nNow, think of your approach and how you would write the code. Remember to follow System's coding style - be systematic and precise in your approach. Break down the problem into smaller tasks: splitting the sentence into words, applying the translation function on each word individually, and then joining back all the translated words into a single string. \nHere is an example of how you might implement this solution using Python:\n```python\ndef translate(sentence):\n# Split the sentence into individual words\nwords = sentence.split()\n\n# Apply pig latin translation on each word\ntranslated_words = [translate_word(word) for word in words]\n\n# Join back all translated words to form a single string\nreturn ' '.join(translated_words)\n\ndef translate_word(word):\nvowels = set('aeiou') \nif word[0].lower() in vowels:\nreturn word + \"way\"\nelse:\n# Find the first vowel in the word, if no vowel found go to end of word\nfor i in range(len(word)):\nif word[i].lower() in vowels:\nreturn word[i:] + word[:i] + \"ay\"\nreturn word + \"ay\"\n```\nIn this code snippet, the `translate` function splits a sentence into individual words and applies the `translate_word` function on each one. The `translate_word` function checks whether the first letter of a word is a vowel or not and accordingly transforms it to pig latin. This approach allows for parallel processing since Python's built-in `split` method can be applied to an entire string concurrently. \n\nAnswer: Your code snippet should follow this pattern to translate sentences into Pig Latin. It consists of two main functions - `translate`, which applies the pig latin translation on each word, and `translate_word`, which performs the actual translation operation for a single word. The logic behind it is as follows:\n- Check if the first letter of the word is in set of vowels. If yes then append \"way\" to end of that word.\n- If no, find the first vowel in the word and form the pig latin string by taking substring before this vowel and appending \"ay\". \nThis approach should give you an idea on how you can solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller tasks.","status":200,"tokens":[187,812],"elapsed":25.926063084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
