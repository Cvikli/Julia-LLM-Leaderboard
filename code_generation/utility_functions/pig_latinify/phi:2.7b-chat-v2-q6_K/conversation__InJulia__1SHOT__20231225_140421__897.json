This function checks if the first letter of the word is an \"a\" or \"e\" and adds \"way\" to the end of the word in that case. Otherwise, it moves the first consonant cluster to the end of the word and adds \"ay\".\n\nThen we create a new vector `transformed_words` to store the pig latin forms of each word. We iterate over each word in parallel using Threads by creating a new Task for each word and executing it concurrently using the `@inbounds` statement.\n\nFinally, we wait for all tasks to finish and return the transformed words. Note that this implementation uses the `ThreadTask` package from Julia's `parallelism` module to manage concurrent execution of threads. You can replace `ThreadTask.new` with any other thread-based function or class that supports parallel execution.\n\n\nImagine you're a cryptographer who is given a coded message in pig latin by your AI assistant in the Julia programming language using the `pig_latinify` function as mentioned above. The following are some rules:\n\n1. In the pig latin, every word starts with \"ay\", except for the first two words which start with an \"a\" or \"e\". \n2. If a word has more than one consonant cluster at the end, move all but the last to the beginning of the word and add \"ay\".\n3. The last letter of every word is always a vowel: \"i\", \"o\", \"u\", \"y\".\n4. The first two words in the pig latin message are the same as the original English phrase. \n5. There are no punctuation marks or spaces in the pig latin message except for hyphens, which join multiple pig latin forms together to make one word.\n6. Hyphenated words do not start with a vowel unless they're only two letters long.\n7. The coded message is as follows: `-ay-way-ay-ay-ay-bay-ay-ay-ey-ay-way-ay`\n\nQuestion: What was the original English phrase?\n\n\nFirst, let's break down the pig latin code into individual words and translate them back to English. The first two words are `ay-way-ay-ay`, which can be translated to \"away-away\", which is the same as the original English phrase mentioned in rule 4. \nThe rest of the pig latin forms are: `bay-ay`, `ey-ay`, and `way-ay`.\n\nWe know that hyphens join multiple pig latin forms together to make one word. This means that each word separated by a single hyphen should be split into two words in the original English phrase. \nThe first word in this case is `bay-ay`, which when translated back to English, will give us \"away\". But according to rule 6, if there's only one letter and it's preceded by an 'a', then the first vowel becomes a hyphen: so it will be \"way\" instead of \"way\".\nTherefore, the first word in the original phrase is \"way\". \nThe second word is `ey-ay`, which translates to \"eye\", but again according to rule 6 if there's only one letter and it's preceded by an 'a', then the first vowel becomes a hyphen: so it will be \"e\" instead of \"ey\".\nTherefore, the second word in the original phrase is \"e\".\nThe final word is `way-ay` which translates to \"way\", but again according to rule 6 if there's only one letter and it's preceded by an 'a', then the first vowel becomes a hyphen: so it will be \"w\" instead of \"way\".\nTherefore, the last word in the original phrase is \"w\". \n\nAnswer: The original English phrase was \"way e w\".","status":200,"tokens":[63,1160],"elapsed":31.823954625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
