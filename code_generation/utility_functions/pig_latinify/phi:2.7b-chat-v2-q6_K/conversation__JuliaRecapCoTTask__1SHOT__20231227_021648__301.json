X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

However, here's a general implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Strings\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings : Vector{String})\n    if isempty(strings) || !isVector(strings) || strings.length == 0\n        return strings\n    end\n\n    num_threads = 4\n    chunks = Array{UInt, 2}(0:num_threads-1)\n\n    for i in 1:strings.length\n        threads::Parallel{Tuple{Int, Int}}(pig_latinify_chunk, numThreads=num_threads) {\n            chunks[i/num_threads] = (chunks[i/num_threads] + 1, i % num_threads == 0 ? i : i + 1)\n        }\n    end\n\n    Array{UInt}(1:num_threads).map!(function j -> pig_latinify_chunk(strings[chunks[j][0]:chunks[j][1]]))\n\n    return concat!([$'way', $'ay'] . strsplit($')way')(... strings)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `Threads` from the `Threads` package to parallelize the pig latinification of each string in the input vector. It splits the strings into chunks, and then spawns a thread for each chunk. The threads call the `pig_latinify_chunk` function to process their respective chunks of strings. Finally, it concatenates the transformed strings back together and returns them as a new array.","status":200,"tokens":[352,430],"elapsed":12.726501208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
