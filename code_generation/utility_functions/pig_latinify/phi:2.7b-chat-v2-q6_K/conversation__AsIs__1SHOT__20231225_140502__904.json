The `process_input` function prompts the user to enter text and then calls `pig_latinify` on it in a separate thread. It also joins all threads after they've completed processing their inputs.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each word is separated by a single space, but you could easily modify it to handle other delimiters if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[60,480],"elapsed":12.352309666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
