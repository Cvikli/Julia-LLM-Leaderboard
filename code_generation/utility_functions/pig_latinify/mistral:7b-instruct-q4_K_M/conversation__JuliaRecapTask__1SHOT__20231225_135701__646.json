[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

For each element, we yield the original string in lowercase using `yield x[:lower()]`, its reverse using `yield string(reverse(x))`, and \"way\" using `yield \"way\"`.\n- The `pig_latinify` function returns an iterator (an object of type `Iterators.AbstractIterator`) that allows us to iterate over the results. We use it to print the transformed strings as follows:\n  - First, we create a random vector of 5 strings with length 10 characters each using `sample(10, 5)`.\n  - Then, we call `pig_latinify` on this vector and store the result in `latins`, an iterator object.\n  - Finally, we use a `println` statement inside a loop to print the original strings followed by their pig latin counterparts.","status":200,"tokens":[371,453],"elapsed":19.980062375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
