The resulting pig latin strings are stored in a new vector and returned by the function.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input strings only contain letters and spaces, and ignores any other characters or punctuation. If you need to handle other types of characters or special cases, you may need to modify the `pig_latin` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[106,327],"elapsed":13.266827958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
