It operates on each string in parallel using `Threads.@async`, which allows for concurrent execution. The `pig_latinify_task` function is used to translate each individual string to pig latin, and the results are stored in a separate array called `pig_latins`.","status":200,"tokens":[106,366],"elapsed":14.7179915,"_type":"aimessage"}]
