Here's an example implementation:\n```python\nimport threading\nfrom queue import Queue\n\ndef pig_latinify(word, q):\n\"\"\"Transforms a single word to Pig Latin.\"\"\"\nif len(word) > 1:\nfirst_letter = word[0]\nrest_of_word = word[1:]\n\npig_latin_word = first_letter + \"way\"\nif rest_of_word[0].lower() in [\"o\", \"a\"]:\npig_latin_word += rest_of_word[0]\nelif rest_of_word[-1].isupper():\npig_latin_word += rest_of_word[:-1] + rest_of_word[-2:]\nelse:\npig_latin_word += rest_of_word\n\nreturn pig_latin_word.capitalize()\nelse:\nreturn word\n\ndef transform_pig_latin(words, queue):\n\"\"\"Thread function to transform Pig Latin in a separate thread.\"\"\"\nwhile True:\nword = queue.get()\nif not word:\nbreak\n\nresult = pig_latinify(word, queue)\nqueue.task_done()\n\ndef worker_function(q):\n\"\"\"Thread function to consume words from the queue and transform them.\"\"\"\nfor _ in range(len(words)):\nq.put(pig_latinify(words[i], q))\nq.task_done()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nimport os\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\nwords = [\"this\", \"is\", \"an\", \"example\"]\nqueue = Queue()\n\n# Start threads\nt1 = threading.Thread(target=worker_function, args=(queue,))\nt2 = threading.Thread(target=transform_pig_latin, args=(words, queue))\nt3 = threading.Thread(target=worker_function, args=(queue,))\n\n# Enqueue words to be transformed into threads\nfor i in range(len(words)):\nqueue.put(words[i])\n\n# Start the threads\nt1.start()\nt2.start()\nt3.start()\n\n# Wait for all tasks to complete\nq.join()\n\nprint(\"Pig Latin words:\", [w for w in queue.queue if w not in [\"done\", \"exit\"]] + [x.capitalize() for x in words if x not in [\"done\", \"exit\"]] + [f'{i}way-{w}' for i, w in enumerate(words)])\n\n# Stop the threads\nt1.join()\nt2.join()\nt3.join()\n```\nIn this code, we have a `pig_latinify` function that transforms a single word to Pig Latin by moving the first letter to the end of the word and adding \"way\" in between if the original word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). The `transform_pig_latin` function creates a separate thread for transforming words and uses the `queue.task_done()` method to indicate when each task is completed.\n\nWe also have a helper function called `worker_function`, which consumes words from the queue and transforms them in a separate thread. This function is used by three threads, one for consuming words and two for transforming them and signaling completion.\n\nIn the main part of the program, we start the threads, enqueue the words to be transformed, and wait for all tasks to complete before printing the resulting Pig Latin words. Finally, we stop the threads and print the result.","status":200,"tokens":[72,883],"elapsed":16.427673958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
