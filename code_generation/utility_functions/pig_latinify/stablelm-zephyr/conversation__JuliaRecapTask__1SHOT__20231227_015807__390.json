[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

To achieve thread-safe execution, we will use the `Thread` class from the `BaseModule` module in Julia's standard library.\n\n```julia\nusing BaseModule\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n# Create a thread pool with 3 threads\npool = ThreadPool{3}\n\n# Use map function and each thread to process the strings\nresults = pool.map(each_thread, strings)\n\n# Remove the temporary thread objects from memory\nfor _ in 1:length(results), delete($THREAD$0)\n\nreturn results\nend\n```\nIn this code snippet, we create a thread pool with 3 threads using `ThreadPool{3}`. Then, we use the `map` function and each thread to process the input strings concurrently. After all threads have finished processing, we collect the results in the `results` variable and return it. Note that we delete the temporary thread objects from memory after collecting the results for cleaner resource management.\n\nYou can call this function with a vector of strings like this:\n```julia\nstrings = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latin_strings = pig_latinify(strings)\nprintln(\"Pig Latin Strings:\", pig_latin_strings)\n```\nThis will print the Pig Latin version of each input string.","status":200,"tokens":[360,334],"elapsed":7.262553334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
