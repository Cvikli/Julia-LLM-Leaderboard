Here's an example implementation:\n```julia\nusing Thread\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words: Vector{String})\n@assert length(words) == 1, \"The input vector should contain only one string\"\nword = words[1]\n\nif starts_with(word, \"ly\")\nnew_string = word[1:] + \"ay\"\nelse\nnew_string = pig_latinify(\"${word[1:]}${first_verb}\")\nend\n\nreturn new_string\nend\n\nfunction first_verb()\nreturn \"ing\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"grape\"]\nwords_with_pig_latin = Parallel(pig_latinify(words))\nprintln(\"Pig Latin words:\", words_with_pig_latin)\n```\nThis code defines two functions, `pig_latinify` and `first_verb`. The `pig_latinify` function is a recursive implementation of Pig Latin transformation. It takes a vector of strings as input. If the string contains \"ly\", it removes it and adds \"ay\". Otherwise, it appends the base form of \"ing\" (from the first verb) to the end of the string.\nThe `first_verb` function is used as a utility in the recursive implementation of Pig Latin transformation. It returns \"ing\" as the base form for \"ending\" words.\n\nIn the example usage, we create a vector containing three words: [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"grape\"]. We then use `Parallel(pig_latinify(words))` to apply the `pig_latinify` function to each word in parallel using multiple threads. The result is stored in `words_with_pig_latin`. Finally, we print the transformed words.","status":200,"tokens":[75,450],"elapsed":7.917788875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
