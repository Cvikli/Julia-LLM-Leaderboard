[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `pig_latinify` function using multi-threading and the `Thread` class in Julia. This example assumes that you have a vector containing English words as strings:\n```javascript\nusing Thread\nusing Dict\n\n# Example input vector of strings\nwords = [\":-)\", \"hello world!\", \"julia programming is fun\"]\n\n# Define the pig latin function\npig_latinify(word) = if length(word) > 3 && word[1] == \"a\" || word[1] == \"e\" || word[1] == \"i\" || word[1] == \"o\" || word[1] == \"u\"\nthen word[2:] + word[1:word[1]][::-1]\nelse word\nend\n```\nTo apply the pig latin transformation to all words in your input vector, you can create a thread for each word and run the `pig_latinify` function inside that thread. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```javascript\n# Create a list of threads\nthreads = Dict[Tuple{String, Int64}, Thread{on_finalize = _forward}>for (word, i) in enumerate(words) yield(thread=Thread(target=run_pig_latin), word=word)\n\n# Start all threads\n@safe begin\nfor thread in threads.values\nstart_string = thread.word\nthread.join()\nprintln!(\"{} -> {}\", start_string, pig_latinify(start_string))\nend\nend\n```\nThis code creates a thread for each word, starting the thread and printing the transformed word after the thread finishes executing. The `@safe` macro is used to handle possible race conditions when accessing shared resources (in this case, the input vector). Note that you may need to adjust this code according to your specific requirements or environment.","status":200,"tokens":[360,427],"elapsed":8.998951042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
