Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The problem involves multi-threading in Julia, which isn't supported out of the box. However, you can use `Distributed` package to achieve multi-core processing.\n\nHere is a basic implementation of your requirement:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    @sync begin\n        for string in strings\n            @async print(pig_latinify(string))\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Assume a simple algorithm to convert English words into Pig Latin:\n# If a word starts with a vowel, add \"ay\" at the end. Otherwise, move the first consonant or group of consonants after the first vowel in the beginning of the word and add \"ay\".\nfunction pig_latinify(s::String)\n    s = lowercase(s)  # make it case-insensitive\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    for i in 1:length(s)\n        if islower(s[i]) && s[i] in vowels\n            return s * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    first_vowel = findfirst(x -> x == 'a' || x == 'e' || x == 'i' || x == 'o' || x == 'u', s)\n    if first_vowel === nothing\n        return s * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return s[first_vowel+1:end]*s[1:first_vowel] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the above code, `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and then for each string it spawns a new task (thread in Julia) to convert that particular string into Pig Latin.\n\nNote: This is an oversimplification and doesn't cover some corner cases like punctuation marks or words with capital letters, but should be good enough for the purpose of this problem. You may want to enhance it according to your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[109,468],"elapsed":24.903795,"_type":"aimessage"}]
