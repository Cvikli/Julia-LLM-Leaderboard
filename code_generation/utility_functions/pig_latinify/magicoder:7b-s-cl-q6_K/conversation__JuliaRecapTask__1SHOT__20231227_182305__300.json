[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

For the sake of the task, let's assume the following rules for Pig Latin:\n- If the word begins with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end of the word. \n- If the word does not begin with a vowel, move all the letters at the start of the word to the end and add \"ay\".\n\nHere is how you can solve this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(arr::Vector{String})\n    function convert_to_pig_latin(str::AbstractString)\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        str = lowercase(str)  # Convert to lower case for simplicity\n        words = split(str, \" \")  # Split the string into individual words\n        \n        pig_latin_words = map(words) do word\n            if startswith(word, vowels) || length(word) == 1\n                \"$worday\"\n            else\n                \"$(word[2:end])$worday\"\n            end\n        end\n        \n        return join(pig_latin_words, \" \")\n    end\n    \n    # Use Threads.@threads for multithreading\n    threads = @async [convert_to_pig_latin(str) for str in arr] \n    wait(threads)\nend\n```\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"This\", \"is\", \"Julia\"]\nprintln.(pig_latinify(words))\n```\nPlease note that for real-world applications, you might want to consider more sophisticated approaches to handle punctuation, multiple words in the same string, and capital letters.\nAlso, keep in mind Julia is not suited for CPU-bound tasks like this one as it has a high overhead for creating new threads compared to languages designed for such use cases (like Python).","status":200,"tokens":[370,484],"elapsed":27.53919725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
