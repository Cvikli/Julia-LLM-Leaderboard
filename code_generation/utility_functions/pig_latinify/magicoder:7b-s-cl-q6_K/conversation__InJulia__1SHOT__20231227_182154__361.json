Here's how you could write your `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    results = Channel{String}(1)\n    \n    @sync begin\n        for word in words\n            @spawn put!(results, pig_latin(word))\n        end\n    end\n\n    [take!(results) for _ in words]\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    first_letter = word[1]\n    rest_of_the_word = word[2:end] * \"ay\"\n    \n    # capitalize the first letter if it's a consonant\n    starts_with_vowel = in('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', first_letter)\n    return string(starts_with_vowel ? first_letter * rest_of_the_word : uppercasefirst(first_letter), rest_of_the_word)\nend\n```\nIn this script, `pig_latinify` receives a vector of strings and returns the transformed version. It uses `@sync begin ... end` to ensure that all threads are joined before returning the results. Each word is processed in its own thread using `@spawn put!(results, pig_latin(word))`. The `pig_latin` function translates a single word into pig latin and returns the result as a string. It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel to decide whether it should be capitalized before being appended to the rest of the word.\n\nThe `@spawn` macro will run the expression on a separate thread, and `put!`/`take!` are used for communication between threads. \n\nRemember that in Julia, there's no guarantee about the order in which the items will be processed by the workers, nor is it guaranteed that they will all finish before the main thread continues.","status":200,"tokens":[70,460],"elapsed":23.958811042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
