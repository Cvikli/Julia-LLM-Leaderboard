It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using Julia's built-in `split` and `join` functions:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    function process_word(word)\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        word = lowercase(word)\n        if length(word) > 1 && !all(isletter, word) # ignore non-alphabetic words\n            return word\n        elseif first(word) in vowels || length(word) == 1 \n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return string(word[2:end] * word[1], \"ay\")\n        end\n    end\n    Threads.@threads map(process_word, words)\nend\n```\nThis function works by processing each word individually in a separate thread. It checks whether the first character is a vowel or not and then appends \"ay\" to it. If the first character is a consonant, it moves all following consonants at the start of the word to end followed by \"ay\".\n\nThe `@threads` macro from Julia's `Threads` module distributes processing over multiple threads.\n\nUsage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\npig_latinify(words)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[70,311],"elapsed":16.291342041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
