Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's an example of how you can write such function in Julia using multi-threading. \n\n```julia\nusing Distributed\n@everywhere begin # This line is necessary to make `@spawnat` work properly\n\n    function pig_latinify(str::String)\n        words = split(str, \" \")\n        for i in eachindex(words)\n            word = words[i]\n            if length(word) > 1 && isalpha(word[1])\n                word = lowercase(word[2:end] * uppercase(word[1])) * \"-ay\"\n            else\n                word *= \"-ay\"\n            end\n            words[i] = word\n        end\n        return join(words, \" \")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(strings::Vector{String})\n    # Start worker threads\n    nprocs() > 1 || addprocs(4)\n    \n    @sync begin\n        for str in strings\n            @async push!(p, remotecall(() -> pig_latinify(str), workers()[1], str))\n        end\n    end\n    # Retrieve results from worker threads and wait until all tasks are done.\n    p = fetch.(p)\nend\n```\nPlease note that it's important to ensure that the `@everywhere begin ... end` block is executed on every worker node, thus ensuring that `pig_latinify` function can be used on each of them. Also, `addprocs(4)` line is used to add 4 new workers to the cluster, if it's not already set up.\n\nFinally, this code assumes that you have a vector of strings and want to convert every string in parallel to pig latin. The result is a vector of transformed strings.","status":200,"tokens":[109,412],"elapsed":21.622337666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
