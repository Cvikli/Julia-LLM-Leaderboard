It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution in Julia using the Threads module to perform operations on different threads.\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Create an array of Futures (promises) for each word\n    futures = [@async begin \n        word = words[i]\n        vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n        first_letter = first(word)\n        if islowercase(first_letter)\n            isvowel = first_letter in vowels\n        else\n            isvowel = false\n        end\n        \n        if isvowel \n            return \"$(word)$(first_letteray)\"\n        else \n            return \"$(word)$(first_letterayay)\"\n        end\n    end for i in eachindex(words)]\n    \n    # Retrieve the transformed words from the Futures. This will block until all threads have completed.\n    [fetch(future) for future in futures]\nend\n```\nYou can call `pig_latinify` function with an array of strings and it will return their pig latin translations.\n\nThe function `pig_latinify` is performing the same transformation on each word in parallel using different threads, because we used `@async` macro to create a Future for each transformation operation. Then `fetch(future)` blocks until the future is completed and returns the result. \n\nNote: Pig Latin has no specific rules about how to handle words that start with consonants followed by vowels. In this example, we're treating them as if they were words starting with a vowel.","status":200,"tokens":[109,383],"elapsed":20.189261958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
