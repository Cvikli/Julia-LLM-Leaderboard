[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using Julia's parallel computing capabilities, Threads, and Unicode:\n```julia\nusing Unicode, Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strings)\n    Threads.@threads for s in strings\n        words = split(s, \" \")\n        translated_words = [pig_latin_word(w) for w in words]\n        println(\"$(join(translated_words, \" \"))\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_word(word)\n    if first(word) isa Unicode.Latin && !islowerfirst(word)\n        word *= \"ay\"\n        word = move_initial_to_end(word)\n    end\n    return word\nend\n\nfunction islowerfirst(s::String) \n    return s[1] in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') && !(s[2] in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'))\nend\n\nfunction move_initial_to_end(word)\n    firstchar = word[1]\n    return word[2:end] * firstchar\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that this script assumes English words and does not handle any non-English words. The `islowerfirst` function checks if the first character is a vowel, and the `pig_latinify` function translates those words into Pig Latin by moving the initial consonant or group of consonants to the end and appending \"ay\". If it's not a word starting with a vowel, then it just adds \"ay\" at the end.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function is parallelized using threads in order to process each string in the input array independently. Each thread processes one element of the vector and prints out the result. This makes it efficient for processing large numbers of strings, even though this solution is not ideal as there's no clear ordering of the output. If you want a proper ordering of the output, consider using an ordered collection like an OrderedDict or DataFrame to store each translated string.","status":200,"tokens":[370,472],"elapsed":26.841884792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
