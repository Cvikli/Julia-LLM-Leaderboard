This is done in a separate thread for each word. The main function `pig_latinify` creates a new thread for each word in the input list, starts it, and then waits for it to finish using `join`.\n\nWhen you run this code with the example data, it should print:\n```python\n['ellohay', 'applepay', 'strongmay', 'orldway']\n```\nThis means that each word has been correctly converted to pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[197,271],"elapsed":15.093334083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
