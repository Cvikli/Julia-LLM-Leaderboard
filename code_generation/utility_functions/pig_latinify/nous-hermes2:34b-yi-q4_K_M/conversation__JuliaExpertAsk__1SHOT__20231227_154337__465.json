It iterates over each string in the vector of strings and changes it into pig latin using another function called `translate_to_pig_latin`. Each iteration is run on a separate thread for improved performance.\n\nThe implementation follows these steps:\n1. Create an iterator for each word in the input vector.\n2. Determine the number of threads to use based on the available processors and set it as `threads = nprocs()-1`.\n3. Split up the iterators into chunks with a size determined by dividing the length of words by `threads` (rounding up), using `Iterators.PartitionIterator(i-1:min(chunksize*(i-1)+chunksize, length(words)-1), chunksize)`.\n4. Create tasks for each chunk and start processing them asynchronously.\n5. Print the translated words to pig latin using `println($(translate_to_pig_latin(f)))` in a loop over the results of the processing.","status":200,"tokens":[108,500],"elapsed":85.607790125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
