[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish this task, we will need to use the `Threads.@spawn` macro and the `wait()` function in Julia. The `@spawn` macro will allow us to run a function on a separate thread, while `wait()` will make sure that all threads have finished executing before returning the final result.\n\nHere is an example of how we could implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    tasks = []\n\n    for word in words\n        task = Threads.@spawn (return \"ay\" * pig_latinize(word))\n        push!(tasks, task)\n    end\n\n    results = [fetch(t) for t in tasks]\n\n    wait(tasks)\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nHere is the `pig_latinize` function that converts a word to pig latin:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinate(word::AbstractString)\n    if startswith(lowercase(word), \"qu\")\n        return (\"ay\" * word[3:end])[2:end]\n    else\n        return (\"ay\" * word[2:end])[2:end]\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNote that `pig_latinify` returns a vector of strings in pig latin format. This function does not convert the original words, but rather creates new versions of them.","status":200,"tokens":[382,324],"elapsed":67.001458291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
