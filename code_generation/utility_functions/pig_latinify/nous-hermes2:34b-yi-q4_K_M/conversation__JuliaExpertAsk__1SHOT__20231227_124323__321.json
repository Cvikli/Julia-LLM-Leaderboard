It operates on separate threads for efficiency, using the number of available threads as defined by `Threads.nthreads()`. The input `strs` is split into chunks that are processed in parallel by different threads. Each thread then calls the `worker_piglatinify` function to perform pig latin transformation on its chunk of strings.\n\nThe `worker_piglatinify` function takes a vector of strings, processes each string with the `piglatinate` function, and stores the results in another vector for return by the main thread. This creates separate memory space for each worker to store the results, allowing independent processing on different threads.\n\nThe `piglatinate` function checks if a string starts with a vowel and returns the pig latin version of the word. If the first letter is not a vowel, it moves the first letter to the end of the rest of the word and adds \"ay\" at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[108,610],"elapsed":103.763865625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
