The function `transform_to_pig_latin` converts a given string into its pig latin representation. If the first letter of the input string is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), it appends \"way\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it moves the first letter to the end and adds \"ay\" after it.\n\nThis implementation allows for parallel processing using multiple threads, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[108,364],"elapsed":62.417730084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
