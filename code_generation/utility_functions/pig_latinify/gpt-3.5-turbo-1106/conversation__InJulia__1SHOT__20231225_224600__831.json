Here's a simple implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia using multiple threads to iterate over each string in a vector and transform it to pig latin:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if occursin( r\"^[aeiou].*\", word)\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        first_vowel = search(r\"[aeiou]\", word)\n        return word[first_vowel:end] * word[1:first_vowel-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_vector(words::Vector{String})\n    n = length(words)\n    results = Vector{String}(undef, n)\n    @threads for i in 1:n\n        results[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `pig_latinify` function takes a single word as input and transforms it into pig latin. The `pig_latinify_vector` function takes a vector of strings and iterates over each string using multiple threads, calling `pig_latinify` for each string and storing the results in a new vector.","status":200,"tokens":[62,267],"elapsed":2.833302958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
