Below is a simple implementation of the `pig_latinify` function in Julia, which transforms a vector of strings into Pig Latin, with each transformation running on a separate thread using the `Threads.@spawn` macro.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if isempty(word) || !isletter(word[1])\n        return word\n    end\n\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * string(word[1]) * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify_words(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = Threads.@spawn pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return [fetch(pig_latin_words[i]) for i in 1:length(words)]\nend\n\n# Test\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"banana\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify_words(words)\nprintln(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nThis code creates the `pig_latinify` function, which transforms a single word into Pig Latin, and then uses the `pig_latinify_words` function to iterate over a vector of strings and transform them into Pig Latin using separate threads.\n\nYou can further optimize this code by using the `@distributed` macro for parallel iteration if your computation is more compute-intensive.","status":200,"tokens":[62,334],"elapsed":5.208354083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
