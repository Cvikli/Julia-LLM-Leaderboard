The `pig_latinify_vector` function iterates over each string in the input vector using separate threads and transforms them to pig latin. The `@spawn` macro is used to run the pig_latinify function on separate threads, and `map(fetch, results)` is used to collect the results.\n\nYou can run this code in a Julia environment to see the pig latin transformation of the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[62,330],"elapsed":6.679339208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
