Here's an example of how you can create a `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings and uses multithreading to process each string in separate threads:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if in(word[1], vowels)\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(word)\n            if in(word[i], vowels)\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transformer(words::Vector{String})\n    result = fill(String, length(words))\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        result[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nYou can now use the `pig_latin_transformer` function to transform a vector of strings into pig latin using multithreading.","status":200,"tokens":[62,239],"elapsed":3.1918695,"_type":"aimessage"}]
