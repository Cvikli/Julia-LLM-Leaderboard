Below is an example of how you can create a pig latin transformer in Julia that operates on a vector of strings and runs each iteration on a separate thread:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(word::String)\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transformer(words::Vector{String})\n    transformed_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        transformed_words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return transformed_words\nend\n\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"apple\", \"banana\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latin_transformer(words)\nprintln(transformed_words)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `pig_latinify` function takes a single word and transforms it into pig latin. The `pig_latin_transformer` function takes a vector of strings and uses multithreading to transform each word into pig latin.","status":200,"tokens":[62,251],"elapsed":4.235680875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
