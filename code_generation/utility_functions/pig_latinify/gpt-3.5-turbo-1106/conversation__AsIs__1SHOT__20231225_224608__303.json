Here's a Python implementation of the `pig_latinify` function that operates on a vector of strings using the `threading` module to run each iteration on a separate thread.\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n    if word[0].lower() in vowels:\n        return word + 'ay'\n    else:\n        return word[1:] + word[0] + 'ay'\n\ndef pig_latinify_string(word_list):\n    threads = []\n    result = []\n\n    def process_word(word):\n        result.append(pig_latinify(word))\n\n    for word in word_list:\n        thread = threading.Thread(target=process_word, args=(word,))\n        threads.append(thread)\n        thread.start()\n\n    for thread in threads:\n        thread.join()\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nwords = ['hello', 'world', 'apple', 'banana']\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify_string(words)\nprint(pig_latin_words)  # Output: ['ellohay', 'orldway', 'appleay', 'ananabay']\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we define the `pig_latinify` function to convert a single word to pig latin. Then, the `pig_latinify_string` function is created to iterate over the list of words, launching a separate thread for each word's transformation with the `threading` module. Finally, the results are collected once all threads have completed and returned as a list.","status":200,"tokens":[59,320],"elapsed":3.423717541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
