[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Since no specific instructions were provided in the Special Instructions section, I'll follow standard Julia syntax and guidelines.\n\nHere's how the solution can be implemented:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(input_strings::Vector{String})\n    output = similar(input_strings) # Create an empty vector to store the results\n    \n    map(x -> (Threads.@spawn do\n                    index = findfirst(x .== ' ')\n                    word = x[1:index-1] * x[index:end]\n                    if length(word) > 0\n                        output[findfirst(input_strings .== x)] = \"ay\" * word\n                    end\n                end), input_strings) # Start a separate thread for each string\n    \n    Threads.waitthreads() # Wait for all threads to finish\n    return output\nend\n```\n\nThis function `pig_latinify` takes in an array of strings as its argument, converts them one by one to pig Latin using a separate thread, and stores the results in `output`. Once all threads are finished, it returns the modified vector.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that no input string is empty or contains spaces at the beginning. If that's not the case, we may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[381,337],"elapsed":22.840018791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
