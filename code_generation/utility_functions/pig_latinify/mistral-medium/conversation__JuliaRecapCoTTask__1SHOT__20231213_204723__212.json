X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

After that, we'll create a threaded version of the function to apply it to a vector of strings.\n\nPig Latin rules:\n1. If a word begins with a vowel, add \"way\" to the end.\n2. If a word begins with a consonant, move it to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\n# Rule-based Pig Latin transformer for a single word\nfunction pig_latin_word(word::AbstractString)\n    is_vowel(c) = c âˆˆ ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n\n    first_char = word[1]\n    if is_vowel(first_char)\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n        return rest_of_word * first_char * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n\n# Threaded Pig Latin transformer for a vector of strings\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    pig_latin_words = Threads.@spawn for word in words\n        pig_latin_word(word)\n    end\n\n    return [fetch(pw) for pw in pig_latin_words]\nend\n```\n\nThis solution defines a `pig_latin_word` function that takes a single word and returns its Pig Latin transformation. Then, the `pig_latinify` function uses Julia's built-in `Threads.@spawn` macro to create a separate thread for each word in the input vector. The resulting Pig Latin words are collected and returned as an array.\n\nConfidence: 95%","status":200,"tokens":[370,438],"elapsed":27.9967285,"_type":"aimessage"}]
