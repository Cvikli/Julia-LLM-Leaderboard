The pig latin transformation rules used here are simple: for words that start with a vowel, just append \"way\"; for words that start with a consonant, move the first letter to the end and append \"ay\".\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Create an empty vector to store the transformed words\n    pig_words = String[]\n\n    # Iterate over each word and create a separate thread to transform it to pig latin\n    for word in words\n        Threads.@spawn begin\n            push!(pig_words, pig_latin_transform(word))\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Wait for all threads to finish and return the transformed words\n    Threads.wait()\n    return pig_words\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_transform(word::String)\n    # Check if the word starts with a vowel\n    if startswith(word, [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"])\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        # Move the first letter to the end and append \"ay\"\n        return word[2:end] * word[1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"pig\", \"latin\"]\npig_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_words)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"orldway\", \"igpay\", \"atinlay\"]","status":200,"tokens":[107,403],"elapsed":14.840968709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
