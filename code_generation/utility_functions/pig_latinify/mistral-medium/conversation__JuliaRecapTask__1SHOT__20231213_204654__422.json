[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

First, we import the `Threads` module, which provides the `@async` macro for creating new tasks.\n2. We define a helper function `to_pig_latin` that takes a single string and converts it to pig latin. This function checks if the string is empty, and if so, returns an empty string. If the string is not empty, it finds the first letter that is not a vowel (`aeiouAEIOU`). If there are no consonants at the beginning of the string, it adds \"way\" to the end. Otherwise, it moves the consonants to the end of the string and adds \"ay\".\n3. We define the main function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings and returns a vector of pig latin strings. This function creates a vector of tasks, one for each string. It then uses a loop to create a new task for each string using the `@async` macro and stores it in the tasks vector. Once all tasks have been created, it waits for all tasks to complete using the `fetch` function, which returns the result of the task. Finally, it collects the results into a new vector of strings and returns it.\n4. We provide an example usage of the `pig_latinify` function, which takes a vector of strings and prints the corresponding vector of pig latin strings.\n\nNote that this solution uses abstract types (`AbstractString`) and avoids using new packages. It also emphasizes performance by using multiple threads to perform the string transformations concurrently. Additionally, it follows the Julia language syntax and guidelines, including using 1-based indexing and type annotations.","status":200,"tokens":[367,856],"elapsed":38.085596125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
