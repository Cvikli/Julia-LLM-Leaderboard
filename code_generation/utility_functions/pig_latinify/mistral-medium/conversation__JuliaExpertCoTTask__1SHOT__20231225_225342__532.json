Think through your approach step by step:\n* Define a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input\n* Iterate over the vector and apply a pig latin transformation function to each string\n* Use `Threads.@threads` to run each iteration on a separate thread\n* Return a vector of transformed strings\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(strings::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_transform(word) = begin\n        if isempty(word)\n            return \"\"\n        else\n            first_char = word[1]\n            rest_of_word = word[2:end]\n            if first_char âˆˆ ['a','e','i','o','u']\n                return word * \"way\"\n            else\n                idx = findfirst(isequal(first_char), lowercase(word))\n                return rest_of_word[1:idx-1] * first_char * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    Threads.@threads for string in strings\n        global strings[Threads.threadid()] = pig_latin_transform(string)\n    end\n\n    return strings\nend\n```\n3.
