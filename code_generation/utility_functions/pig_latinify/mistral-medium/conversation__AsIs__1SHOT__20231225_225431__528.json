Here's a possible implementation using the `concurrent.futures` library to run the iterations on separate threads:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport re\n\ndef to_pig_latin(word):\n    if len(word) == 0:\n        return word\n\n    first_vowel_index = max(map(str.find, \"aeiouAEIOU\", word))\n    if first_vowel_index == 0:\n        return word + \"way\"\n\n    consonants = word[:first_vowel_index]\n    rest = word[first_vowel_index:]\n\n    return rest + consonants + \"ay\"\n\ndef pig_latinify(words):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        results = [executor.submit(to_pig_latin, word) for word in words]\n        pig_latin_words = [future.result() for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(results)]\n\n    return pig_latin_words\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"pig\", \"python\"]\npig_latin_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprint(pig_latin_words)\n```\n\nThis code defines a `to_pig_latin` function that transforms individual words and a `pig_latinify` function that takes a list of words, creates a separate thread for each word, and applies the `to_pig_latin` function concurrently.\n\nKeep in mind that the Pig Latin rules in the `to_pig_latin` function are quite basic and may not cover all possible edge cases. You can modify or enhance the function to better suit your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[65,455],"elapsed":10.118536916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
