Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Define a function `pig_latinify` taking a vector of strings as input.\n   - Iterate over the vector using multiple threads.\n   - For each string, apply the pig latin transformation rules.\n   - Combine the results and return them as a vector.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n   - Import the `Threads` module.\n   - Define the `pig_latinify` function using `@spawn` to create multiple threads.\n3. Solve the task:\n   - Run the `pig_latinify` function on the example data.\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n   - Observe the expected output.\n\nConfidence: 95%","status":200,"tokens":[195,419],"elapsed":17.047800333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
