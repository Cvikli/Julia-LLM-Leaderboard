[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latin` function is called on each string to transform it to pig latin. Once all the threads have finished running, the results are collected using the `fetch` function and the `map` function is used to convert the thread objects to strings.\n\nNote that the type annotation for the input vector is `<:AbstractString`, which means that it can accept any type of string, such as `String` or `SubString`. The `pig_latin` function uses multiple dispatch to handle both lowercase and uppercase words.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `pig_latinify` function:\n```\njulia> words = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"x\", \"Pig\", \"Latin\"]\n5-element Vector{String}:\n \"hello\"\n \"world\"\n \"x\"\n \"Pig\"\n \"Latin\"\n\njulia> pig_latinify(words)\n5-element Vector{String}:\n \"ellohay\"\n \"orldway\"\n \"ix-hay\"\n \"Igpay\"\n \"Atinlay\"\n```\nAs you can see, each string has been transformed to pig latin correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[367,623],"elapsed":28.499661958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
