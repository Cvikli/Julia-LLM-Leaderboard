The `pig_latin_transformer` function then takes a vector of strings and iterates over each string using separate threads, applying the pig latin transformation using the `pig_latinify` function. The transformed strings are then stored back in the original vector at the corresponding position.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the order of the strings in the vector is important and that the resulting pig latin strings should be stored in the same order as the original strings. If this is not the case, a simpler solution using a threaded map function may be more appropriate.\n\nAlso note that this solution uses the `@threads` macro from the `Threads` package to create separate threads for each iteration. This allows the transformations to be performed concurrently, which can improve performance for large input vectors. However, the performance benefits may be limited by the overhead of creating and managing the threads, so it's important to benchmark the solution to ensure that it provides a benefit in practice.","status":200,"tokens":[107,398],"elapsed":14.959868042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
