To create a Pig Latin transformer function called `pig_latinify` in Python, you can use the `concurrent.futures` library to run each iteration on a separate thread. Here's one way to do it:\n```python\nimport re\nimport string\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n\ndef pig_latinify(word):\n    if not word or word[0] in string.punctuation:\n        return word\n\n    first_letter = word[0].lower()\n    if first_letter in 'aeiou':\n        return word + 'way'\n    else:\n        vowel_index = min(i for i, c in enumerate(word[1:], 1) if c.lower() in 'aeiou') + 1\n        return word[vowel_index:] + word[:vowel_index] + 'ay'\n\ndef pig_latin_transformer(strings):\n    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        pig_latin_strings = list(executor.map(pig_latinify, strings))\n    return pig_latin_strings\n```\nIn the code above, the `pig_latinify` function takes a single string and converts it to Pig Latin. It first checks if the string is empty or if the first character is punctuation, in which case it returns the original string. Otherwise, it checks if the first letter is a vowel, in which case it appends \"way\" to the end of the string. If the first letter is a consonant, it finds the index of the first vowel in the string and moves all the characters before it to the end of the string, followed by \"ay\".\n\nThe `pig_latin_transformer` function takes a vector of strings and applies the `pig_latinify` function to each string using the `executor.map` method, which runs each function call in a separate thread. The resulting Pig Latin strings are returned as a list.\n\nNote that the `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` class creates a fixed-size thread pool, which can help prevent resource exhaustion if you're processing a large number of strings. The size of the thread pool is determined automatically based on the number of available processors.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[65,545],"elapsed":18.560663541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
