The `to_pig_latin` function converts a single word to Pig Latin based on the rules of the language.\n\nYou can adjust the number of threads used by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable before running the code.","status":200,"tokens":[62,309],"elapsed":2.197338625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
