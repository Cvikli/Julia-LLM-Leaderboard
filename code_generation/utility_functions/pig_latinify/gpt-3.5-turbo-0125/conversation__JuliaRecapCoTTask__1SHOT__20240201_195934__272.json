[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This will allow us to execute each transformation concurrently.\n\nHere is the implementation for the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    pig_latin_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    \n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    \n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        first_vowel_pos = findfirst(x -> x in vowels, word) |> default(0)\n        return word[first_vowel_pos:end] * word[1:first_vowel_pos-1] * \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings, creates a new vector to store the Pig Latin versions of the strings, and then uses `Threads.@threads` to iterate over each input string concurrently.\n- Each input string is transformed into Pig Latin using the `pig_latin` function, which moves the first consonant cluster to the end of the word and appends \"ay\".\n- The `pig_latin` function is a helper function that converts a single word to Pig Latin.\n\nYou can now use this `pig_latinify` function to transform a vector of strings into Pig Latin with each transformation running on a separate thread.","status":200,"tokens":[320,371],"elapsed":2.735797875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
