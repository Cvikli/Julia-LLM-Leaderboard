It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that emulates the English language. Pig Latin takes the first consonant or consonant cluster of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an ay. For example:\n\n1. \"pig\" = \"igpay\"\n2. \"banana\" = \"ananabay\"\n3. \"happy\" = \"appyhay\"\n4. \"duck\" = \"uckday\"\n5. \"glove\" = \"oveglay\" \n\nThe transformer should work as follows:\n\n```julia\npig_latinify([\"pig\", \"banana\", \"happy\", \"duck\", \"glove\"])\n# Output: [\"igpay\", \"ananabay\", \"appyhay\", \"uckday\", \"oveglay\"]\n```\n\nHere is a code snippet that implements this transformer:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    results = similar(words, String)\n    Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        word = words[i]\n        # Check if the first character is a vowel\n        if first(word) âˆˆ ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\n            results[i] = word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            consonant_cluster = match(r\"^([bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]+)\", word).match\n            results[i] = word[length(consonant_cluster) + 1 : end] * consonant_cluster * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThe function pig_latinify iterates over the input vector words using multi-threading. For each word, it checks if the first character is a vowel or not. If the first character is a vowel, it simply adds \"ay\" to the end of the word. Otherwise, it finds the consonant cluster at the beginning of the word and moves that cluster to the end of the word along with adding \"ay\".","status":200,"tokens":[108,498],"elapsed":82.865884833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
