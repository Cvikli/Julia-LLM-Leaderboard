It creates an array named `results` with the same length as the input vector to store the transformed words. The transformation for each word is done in parallel by multiple threads, thanks to Julia's Base.Threads package. Each thread gets a separate chunk of indices to process from the range 1:length(words).\n\nEach word is examined and if its first letter is a vowel, it adds \"way\" at the end of the word, else it moves the first letter to the end of the word and appends \"ay\". The transformed words are stored in the `results` array. Finally, the function returns the `results` array containing the pig latinized strings.","status":200,"tokens":[197,322],"elapsed":83.088695333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
