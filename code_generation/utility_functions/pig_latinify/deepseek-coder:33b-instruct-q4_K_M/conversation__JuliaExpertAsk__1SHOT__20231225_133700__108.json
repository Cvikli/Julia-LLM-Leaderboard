If it's a vowel, it just appends \"-ay\" to the word. Otherwise, it finds the position of the first vowel in the word, takes everything after this vowel and before this vowel and combines them with the first part of the word plus \"ay\". \n\nThe function `pig_latinify` is then applied over a vector of strings using threaded processing. The results are stored in a new vector where each entry corresponds to the result for the corresponding string in the input vector. Please note that this code might not work correctly if some words contain non-alphabet characters.","status":200,"tokens":[108,422],"elapsed":70.371714916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
