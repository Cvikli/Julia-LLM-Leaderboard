It checks if the first letter of the word is a vowel or not and based on this does the conversion. \n\nThen we have the function `pig_latinify_threaded`, which uses the Julia's `Threads.@threads` macro to spawn multiple threads (one for each input string) and perform the Pig Latin transformation in parallel. This will speed up the overall execution time if you are processing many strings as it will take advantage of multiple cores available on your machine.","status":200,"tokens":[67,331],"elapsed":54.758996375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
