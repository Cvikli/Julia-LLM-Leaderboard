The `thread::spawn` function is used to start each thread, and `join()` is called on each handle in `children` to wait for all threads to finish. \n\nAlso note that this implementation assumes the input strings are ASCII. If you want it to work with Unicode text as well, you will need a more complex solution.","status":200,"tokens":[64,777],"elapsed":127.422846167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
