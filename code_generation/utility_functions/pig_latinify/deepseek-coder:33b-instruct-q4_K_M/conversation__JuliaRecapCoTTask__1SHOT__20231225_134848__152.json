[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

This function uses the first character of the word to decide if it should append \"way\" or the first letter and \"ay\". \n\nThe `pig_latinify` function overload is used on each thread for each input string in the vector. The transformed strings are then stored back into a new output array that matches the size of the original input array.\n\nIf you want to transform multiple words at once, you can call this as follows:\n\n```julia\ninput = [\"pig\", \"latin\", \"transformer\"]\noutput = pig_latinify(input) # [\"igpay\", \"atinlay\", \"ansformertray\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[396,358],"elapsed":68.596447167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
