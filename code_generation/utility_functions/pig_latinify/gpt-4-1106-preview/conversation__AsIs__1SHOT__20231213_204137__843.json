Below is a simple example of how you might do this in C++. Note that in a real-world scenario, you'd need to consider synchronization issues more thoroughly, particularly if mutating shared data, but since each thread will work on a separate string, we avoid these issues in this particular case.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <vector>\n#include <thread>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nstd::string to_pig_latin(const std::string& word) {\n    if (word.length() == 0) return \"\";\n\n    std::string vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\";\n    if (vowels.find(word[0]) != std::string::npos) {\n        // Word starts with a vowel\n        return word + \"way\";\n    } else {\n        // Word starts with a consonant or consonant cluster\n        size_t firstVowelPos = word.find_first_of(vowels);\n        if (firstVowelPos == std::string::npos) {\n            return word + \"ay\"; // No vowels in word\n        }\n        return word.substr(firstVowelPos) + word.substr(0, firstVowelPos) + \"ay\";\n    }\n}\n\nvoid pig_latinify(std::vector<std::string>& words) {\n    std::vector<std::thread> threads;\n\n    for (std::string& word : words) {\n        threads.emplace_back([&word]() {\n            word = to_pig_latin(word);\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Wait for all threads to finish\n    for (std::thread& t : threads) {\n        if (t.joinable()) {\n            t.join();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::vector<std::string> words = {\"hello\", \"world\", \"threads\", \"example\"};\n    pig_latinify(words);\n\n    for (const std::string& word : words) {\n        std::cout << word << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a `to_pig_latin` function to convert individual words to Pig Latin, following the basic rules: if a word starts with a vowel, \"way\" is appended, and if it starts with a consonant, letters up to the first vowel are moved to the end and \"ay\" is appended.\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and creates a thread for each string, applying the `to_pig_latin` function to each string within a separate thread. After creating the threads, the function waits for all threads to complete their execution using the `join` method.\n\nLastly, in the `main` function, we demonstrate the use of `pig_latinify` by applying it to a sample vector of words and outputting the results.\n\nKeep in mind that this example assumes that it's safe to access and modify each string within the vector independently from multiple threads, as we are not modifying the structure of the vector itself, only the contents of the individual strings. However, if there are other concurrent operations on the `words` vector that might mutate its structure (such as resizing), you would need additional synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.","status":200,"tokens":[59,689],"elapsed":44.178871291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
