The function uses multi-threading to process each word in a separate thread.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    # Define a function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\n    function pig_latin(word::String)\n        vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n        if word[1] in vowels\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            for i in eachindex(word)\n                if word[i] in vowels\n                    return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n                end\n            end\n        end\n        return word * \"ay\"  # For words without vowels\n    end\n\n    # Create an array of futures for concurrent execution\n    futures = [ @spawn pig_latin(word) for word in words ]\n\n    # Collect the results from the futures\n    return fetch.(futures)\nend\n\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"julia\", \"thread\", \"example\"]\ntransformed_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(\"Original words: \", words)\nprintln(\"Pig Latin words: \", transformed_words)\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings and applies the `pig_latin` word transformation to each element using multi-threaded execution powered by the `@spawn` macro. Note that for this code to fully utilize multi-threading, you should start Julia with multiple threads by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable, or by using the `-t` or `--threads` command-line option when starting Julia:\n```shell\njulia -t auto\n```\nThis will allow the use of as many threads as logical CPU cores available on your machine.","status":200,"tokens":[97,399],"elapsed":38.005502041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
