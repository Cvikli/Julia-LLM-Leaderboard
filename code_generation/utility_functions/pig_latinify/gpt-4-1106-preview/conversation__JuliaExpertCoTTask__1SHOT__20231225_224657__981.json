If this is not the case, creating a separate output vector for storing the translated strings is necessary to avoid race conditions. If modification of the original vector is not intended, then return a new vector with translated words.","status":200,"tokens":[170,317],"elapsed":16.853619833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
