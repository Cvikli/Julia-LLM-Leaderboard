Let's review to ensure it's correct.\n\nTo check:\n- The to_pig_latin function must correctly translate a single word.\n- The `pig_latinify` must iterate over the input vector and use separate threads for each word conversion.\n- The result should be a vector of translated words.","status":200,"tokens":[170,519],"elapsed":22.163777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
