Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Define the function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input.\n   - For each string in the vector, create a new thread that will transform the string into pig latin.\n   - The pig latin transformation rules are:\n     - If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), add \"ay\" to the end of the word.\n     - If a word begins with a consonant, move the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word, and add \"ay\".\n   - Collect the results from each thread and return the transformed vector.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n   - A helper function to transform a single word into pig latin.\n   - The main function `pig_latinify` that uses multithreading.\n\n3. Solve the task.\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct using the provided data.\n\nLet's start by writing the helper function to transform a single word into pig latin:\n\n```julia\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::String)\n    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n    if word[1] in vowels\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        for (index, char) in enumerate(word)\n            if char in vowels\n                return word[index:end] * word[1:index-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word  # In case the word doesn't have any vowels\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's write the main function `pig_latinify`:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    transformed_words = Vector{String}(undef, length(words))\n    @sync begin\n        for (index, word) in enumerate(words)\n            @spawn transformed_words[index] = to_pig_latin(word)\n        end\n    end\n    return transformed_words\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's solve the task using the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = pig_latinify([\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n```\n[\"ellohay\", \"appleay\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]\n```\n\nLet's check if the solution is correct by running the code.","status":200,"tokens":[170,512],"elapsed":39.27539975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
