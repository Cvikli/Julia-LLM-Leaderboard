[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The transformation will be done in parallel using multiple threads. In Pig Latin, for words that begin with a vowel, we add \"way\" to the end. For words that begin with a consonant, we move the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the word and add \"ay\".\n\nHere are the steps to solve the task:\n\n1. Define the `pig_latinify` function.\n2. Inside the function, use multi-threading to process each string in the input vector in parallel.\n3. For each string, apply the Pig Latin transformation.\n4. Collect the transformed strings into a new vector.\n5. Return the new vector.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    # Define a function to transform a single word into Pig Latin\n    function pig_latin_transform(word::AbstractString)\n        vowels = \"aeiou\"\n        if isempty(word)\n            return word\n        elseif occursin(r\"^[aeiouAEIOU]\", word)\n            return word * \"way\"\n        else\n            for i in 1:length(word)\n                if occursin(word[i], vowels)\n                    return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n                end\n            end\n        end\n        return word  # In case the word has no vowels\n    end\n\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the transformed words\n    transformed_words = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(words))\n\n    # Use multi-threading to transform each word in parallel\n    @threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        transformed_words[i] = pig_latin_transform(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return transformed_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function will take a vector of strings and return a new vector with each string transformed into Pig Latin using multi-threading. Each thread will handle the transformation of a single word, allowing for parallel processing of the input vector.","status":200,"tokens":[320,445],"elapsed":50.138328958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
