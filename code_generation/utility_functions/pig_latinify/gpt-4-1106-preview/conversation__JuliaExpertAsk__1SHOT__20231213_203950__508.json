Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of `pig_latinify` function in Julia that operates on a vector of strings and transforms each string into Pig Latin using multithreading:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads: @spawn, ThreadPinned\n\nfunction translate_to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"\n    if first(word) in vowels\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for i in eachindex(word)\n            if word[i] in vowels\n                return word[i:end] * word[1:i-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    # If no vowels are present, return the original word\n    return word\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    tasks = Vector{Task}(undef, length(words))\n    for (i, word) in enumerate(words)\n        tasks[i] = @spawn translate_to_pig_latin(word)\n    end\n    return [fetch(tasks[i]) for i in 1:length(tasks)]\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"threads\"]\npig_latinified_words = pig_latinify(words)\nprintln(pig_latinified_words)\n```\n\nThe `translate_to_pig_latin` function is a helper that performs the actual translation. The `pig_latinify` function then iterates over the input vector of strings, creating a separate thread for each translation using the `@spawn` macro. Once all translations have been started, it waits for each to complete using `fetch` and then returns the vector of translated strings.","status":200,"tokens":[97,342],"elapsed":23.620767208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
