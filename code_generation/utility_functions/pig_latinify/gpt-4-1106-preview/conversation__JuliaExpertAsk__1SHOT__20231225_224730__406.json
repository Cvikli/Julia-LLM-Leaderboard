Here's an example of how the `pig_latinify` function can be written:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n\n    # Define the pig latin transformation\n    function to_pig_latin(word::String)::String\n        if length(word) == 0 || !(isletter(word[1]))\n            return word\n        end\n        first_letter = lowercase(word[1])\n        if first_letter in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word[2:end] * first_letter * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Run each transformation in a separate thread\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\nPlease note the following considerations when running the above function:\n\n- `Threads.@threads` requires you to set up multiple threads for your Julia session, which you can do by setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable or by starting Julia with the `-t` or `--threads` option.\n- Each word is processed in a thread-safe manner because the writing is happening to separate indices of the `pig_latin_words` array.\n- The `to_pig_latin` function is a local function that performs the pig latin conversion.\n- Edge cases (such as empty strings or strings starting with non-letters) are managed simply by returning the original word.\n\nMake sure to initialize Julia with multiple threads, or this code will run single-threaded:\n\n```shell\njulia -t auto\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS`:\n\n```shell\nexport JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 # for UNIX-like systems\nset JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 # for Windows systems\n```\n\nAnd then run your Julia script or REPL as usual. Each thread will process an item from the `words` array in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[97,473],"elapsed":14.328561084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
