The main function, `pig_latinify_vec`, takes a vector of strings and applies the `pig_latinify` function to each element in parallel using separate threads with the help of the `Threads.map` function. Finally, it concatenates the results with `Threads.reduce(vcat)`.","status":200,"tokens":[73,412],"elapsed":16.424974167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
