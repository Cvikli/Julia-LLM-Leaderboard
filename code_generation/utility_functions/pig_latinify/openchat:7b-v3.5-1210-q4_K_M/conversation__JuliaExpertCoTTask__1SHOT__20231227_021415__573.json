It consists of two functions: `pig_latinify_word`, which converts a single word into Pig Latin, and `pig_latinify`, which applies the transformation to each word in a given vector of strings using separate threads.\n\nThe program then tests the function on the input `[\"hello\", \"apple\", \"strong\", \"world\"]`. The output should be `[\"ellohay\", \"appleway\", \"ongstray\", \"orldway\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[202,461],"elapsed":25.206078584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
