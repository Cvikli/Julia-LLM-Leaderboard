[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings. It iterates over each string and changes it to pig latin. Each iteration should run on a separate thread.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This problem is a combination of string manipulation and parallel processing in Julia. \n\nFirstly, we need to implement the pig latin transformer function that will convert each word in a sentence to pig latin. In Pig Latin, the first consonant cluster or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word and \"ay\" is appended after it. Words starting with vowel sounds have \"way\" appended instead.\n\nSecondly, we will use Julia's multithreading capabilities to speed up the process by running each transformation in a separate thread. \n\nHere's how we can solve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(sentence::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    words = split(sentence)\n    latin_words = map(x -> if startswith(x, \"a\") || startswith(x, \"e\") || startswith(x, \"i\") || startswith(x, \"o\") || startswith(x, \"u\")\n                           x * \"way\" \n                       else \n                           join([y[2:end] for y in wordsif startswith(y, regex(\"^[aeiou]\", :global))][1], \"\") * x * \"ay\"\n                       end, words)\n    return join(latin_words, \" \")\nend\n```\n\nNext, we'll create a function to run the pig latinify function in parallel threads:\n\n```julia\nfunction par_pig_latinify(sentences::Vector{AbstractString})::Vector{AbstractString}\n    tasks = [Task(()->pig_latinify(sentence)) for sentence in sentences]\n    results = map(wait, tasks)\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that Julia doesn't support multithreading out of the box. The `Tasks.jl` package provides a way to run asynchronous tasks (similar to threads). You can install it via `import Pkg; Pkg.add(package=\"Tasks\")`. \n\nNow you can use these functions as follows:\n\n```julia\nsentences = [\"hello\", \"world\", \"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"test\"]\nresults = par_pig_latinify(sentences)\nprintln(results)\n```\n\nThis will print an array of pig latin strings converted in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[379,545],"elapsed":23.831665875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
