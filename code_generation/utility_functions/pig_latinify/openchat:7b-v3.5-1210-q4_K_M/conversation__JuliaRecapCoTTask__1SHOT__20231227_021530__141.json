[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It is called within each thread.\n\n- The function `pig_latinify_threads` accepts a vector of strings and uses Julia's built-in multithreading support to process each string concurrently.\n\n- Each thread (corresponding to each string in the input) runs the function `pig_latinify`, and its result is stored in `results`.\n\n- The threads are spawned using the `@spawn` macro, and then `wait` is called on each one to ensure they have all finished before moving on. This step isn't strictly necessary if you know your input will fit into your system's thread count, but it's a good practice to prevent race conditions.\n\nRemember, Julia handles parallel programming with ease, thanks to its built-in multithreading support and the `Threads` package.","status":200,"tokens":[381,515],"elapsed":22.710788542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
