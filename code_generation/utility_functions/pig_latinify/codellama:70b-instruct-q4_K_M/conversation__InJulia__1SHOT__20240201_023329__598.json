We specify 3 as the number of workers to create, which means that we can run up to three tasks concurrently in parallel.\n*   The `@everywhere` macro is used to distribute the `pig_latinify` function across all workers. It allows us to call the function on any worker process without having to explicitly specify which worker should be used.\n*   The `pig_latinify` function takes a word as input and returns its Pig Latin version. It finds the index of the first vowel in the word using the `findfirst` function, and then uses string concatenation (`string`) to reorder the letters accordingly. If no vowels are found or if the word does not contain any letters, it simply returns the original word.\n*   The `main` function defines a vector of words (`words`) and iterates over each element using a for loop. The `@sync` macro ensures that all spawned tasks have finished before continuing execution. Each task is spawned on an available worker process using `@spawnat :any`. This allows the tasks to run in parallel across different workers, and `:any` tells Julia to choose any available worker from the pool.\n*   Finally, we call `main()` to execute the code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,545],"elapsed":29.378916774,"_type":"aimessage"}]
