The `pig_latinify` function takes a string as input and transforms it into Pig Latin, following the rules you provided. It returns the transformed string.\n2.  The `pig_latinify_threaded` function is the wrapper that operates on a vector of strings. It initializes an empty result vector to store the transformed strings.\n3.  We use a multithreaded loop (`Threads.@threads`) to iterate over each string in the input vector, calling `pig_latinify` for each one and storing the result in its corresponding position in the result vector. This allows us to process multiple strings simultaneously using Julia's built-in multithreading capabilities.\n4.  Finally, we return the transformed vector of strings as the output of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,556],"elapsed":29.949373566,"_type":"aimessage"}]
