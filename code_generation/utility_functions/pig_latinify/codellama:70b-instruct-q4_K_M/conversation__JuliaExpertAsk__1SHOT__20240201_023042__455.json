We use `Threads.nthreads()` to get the number of threads available on your system.\n2. The `@sync` macro is used to wait for all spawned tasks to complete before proceeding.\n3. We iterate over each string in a separate thread using `Threads.@spawn`.\n4. For each string, we isolate its first letter and rest of the word.\n5. We check if the first letter starts with a vowel or consonant and perform the appropriate transformation.\n6. Finally, we return an array containing the transformed strings in their original order. 🐖🔥","status":200,"tokens":[0,491],"elapsed":26.391061885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
