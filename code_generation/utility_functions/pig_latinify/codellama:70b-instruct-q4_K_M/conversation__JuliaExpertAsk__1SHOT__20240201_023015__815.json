Each iteration runs on its own thread.\n\nThe function `pig_latinify_single()` is defined to transform a single string to pig Latin (according to your pig latin rules). It first removes the initial consonant, adds it at the end of the word, and appends \"ay\" after it. This transformed string is then stored in the `pig_latin` array.\n\nNote: Make sure to adjust the number of worker threads using `Threads.nthreads()` according to your system's CPU cores.","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":23.13215561,"_type":"aimessage"}]
