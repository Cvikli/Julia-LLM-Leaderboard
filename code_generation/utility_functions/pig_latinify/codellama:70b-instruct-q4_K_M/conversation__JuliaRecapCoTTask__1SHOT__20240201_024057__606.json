[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Import the necessary libraries: `Threads` and `Printf`.\n 2. Write the function to convert each word from English to Pig Latin: `pig_latinify(word)`. This function takes a single word as input, and returns its Pig Latin equivalent.\n 3. Create an empty array to store the Pig Latin versions of the words: `words_in_pig_latin = String[]`.\n 4. Use `@threads` macro to iterate over each word in parallel using multiple threads:\n ```julia\n @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n    # Transform each word to Pig Latin and store it in the array\n    push!(words_in_pig_latin, pig_latinify(words[i]))\n end\n```\n5. The function `pig_latinify` should contain the logic to transform a single English word to Pig Latin:\n ```julia\n function pig_latinify(word)\n    # Check if the first letter is a vowel or not\n    if startswith(lowercase(word), ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])\n        return @sprintf(\"%sway\", word)  # If it's a vowel, add \"way\" at the end\n    else\n        suffix = \"\"  # Create an empty string to store the consonants\n        for (i, c) in enumerate(word)\n            if c in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] || i == length(word)\n                break\n            end\n            # Extract and append the leading consonants until we hit a vowel\n            suffix *= word[i]\n        end\n        return @sprintf(\"%s%say\", word, suffix)  # Move the leading consonants to the end and add \"ay\"\n    end\nend\n```\n6. Finally, print out the transformed words: `println.(words_in_pig_latin)`.","status":200,"tokens":[19,450],"elapsed":24.66110167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
