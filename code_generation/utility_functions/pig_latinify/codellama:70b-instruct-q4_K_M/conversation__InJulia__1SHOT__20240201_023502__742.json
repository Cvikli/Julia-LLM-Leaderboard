Each iteration should run on a separate thread.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads   # import the threads library\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words)\n    result = Vector{String}()   # initialize a vector to store results\n    Threads.@threads for word in words   # iterate over each string using multiple threads\n        first_letter = lowercase(word[1])  # extract the first letter of each word\n        suffix = get_suffix(first_letter)  # determine the appropriate pig latin suffix based on the first letter\n        pig_latin_word = join([lowercase(word)[2:end], string(\"-\", first_letter, suffix)])   # transform to pig latin and append to result vector\n        push!(result, pig_latin_word)  # add the transformed word to the result vector\n    end\n    return result   # return the vector of transformed words\nend\n```\nIn the above code snippet:\n* `pig_latinify` is a function that takes a vector of strings as input. It iterates over each string using multiple threads using `@threads`.\n* The `get_suffix` function determines the appropriate pig latin suffix based on the first letter of a word, which is passed to it.\n* `join` concatenates the transformed word with the pig latin suffix and appends it to the result vector.\n\nUsage example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]   # input vector of strings\nresult = pig_latinify(words)    # call the function\nprintln(result)  # print out the transformed words\n```\nThis code would output something like:\n```\n[\"ppleay\", \"ananabay\", \"errychay\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":21.770829657,"_type":"aimessage"}]
