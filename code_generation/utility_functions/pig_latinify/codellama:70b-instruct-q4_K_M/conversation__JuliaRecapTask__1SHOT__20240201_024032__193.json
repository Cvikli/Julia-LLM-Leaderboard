[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Write a function `pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})`, which takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of pig latinized words as output.\n3. Split each word in the input vector into an array of characters using `split(word, \"\")`.\n4. Use `Threads.@threads` macro to create threads for each element of the input vector. This will help you parallelize the process of transforming each word to pig latin.\n5. Inside the thread block:\n\n    * If the first character is a vowel (easy way to check with `startswith(word, \"aeiou\")`), append `\"way\"` at the end and return the transformed word.\n    * Else, append the first letter to the end of the word after removing it from the beginning, followed by `\"ay\"`.\n6. Return the vector of pig latinized words.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n```julia\nusing Threads\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{String})\n    output = Vector{String}()\n\n    @threads for word in words\n        chars = split(word, \"\") # convert to char array\n        \n        if startswith(chars[1], \"aeiou\")  # vowel check\n            push!(output, join(vcat(chars, \"way\")))\n        else\n            push!(output, join(vcat(chars[2:end], chars[1], \"ay\")))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return output\nend\n```\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"world\"]\npig_latinified_words = pig_latinify(words)  # Output: [\"ellohay\", \"orldway\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,417],"elapsed":22.703439856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
