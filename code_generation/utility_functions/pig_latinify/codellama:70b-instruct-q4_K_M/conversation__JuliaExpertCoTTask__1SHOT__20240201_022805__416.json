Each task transforms the word into pig latin using the `create_pig_latin()` function, which is not provided here. The transformed words are then put into the channel. Finally, the results are collected from the channel and returned as a vector of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":16.751321489,"_type":"aimessage"}]
