[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Start by creating an array that contains all of the strings you want to transform into Pig Latin. You can call this array something like `words`. 2. Next, create a function called `pig_latinify` that takes in a single string as input and returns its pig latin version. This is where you'll write your logic for converting an individual word to pig latin. 3. After creating the `pig_latinify` function, iterate over each element of the `words` array using a `for` loop. Inside this loop, call the `pig_latinify` function on each string and store its return value in a new array called `pig_latinified_words`. 4. Finally, outside of your for loop, print out each element of the `pig_latinified_words` array to see the Pig Latin versions of your original words.\nNote: Since you want to run each iteration on a separate thread, you may want to consider using Julia's built-in [Threads](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/#man-multithreading) module. This will allow you to utilize parallel processing and potentially speed up the execution of your code.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":15.108652332,"_type":"aimessage"}]
