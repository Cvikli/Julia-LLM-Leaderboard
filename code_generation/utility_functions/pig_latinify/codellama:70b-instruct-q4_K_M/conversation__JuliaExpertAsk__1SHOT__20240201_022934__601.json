In Julia, we can define a function to convert the individual words in a vector to Pig Latin using string processing functions like `split`, `uppercasefirst` and `join`. We can also use the `@threads` macro to parallelize the loop over each word in the input vector.\n2. Here's how you could implement it:\n```julia-repl\n# Define a function to convert a single word to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify(word)\n    # Handle an empty string or one with no vowels\n    if isempty(word) || all(!occursin(v, word) for v in \"aeiouAEIOU\")\n        return word\n    end\n    # Find the first vowel index in the word\n    i = findfirst(c -> occursin(c, \"aeiouAEIOU\"), word)\n    if isnothing(i) || i == 1\n        return uppercasefirst(word) * \"way\"\n    end\n    # Re-order the letters to create the Pig Latin word\n    pig_latin = string(uppercasefirst(word[i:end]), lowercase(word[1:i - 1]), \"ay\")\n    return pig_latin\nend\n\n# Define a function to convert an entire vector of words to Pig Latin\nfunction pig_latinify_all(words)\n    # Use @threads macro for parallelism\n    @threads for i in eachindex(words)\n        # Convert the word to Pig Latin and store it back in the same index\n        words[i] = pig_latinify(words[i])\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\nNow, you can call `pig_latinify_all` with a vector of strings as input. The function will iterate over each string and convert it to Pig Latin using multiple threads in parallel.","status":200,"tokens":[0,429],"elapsed":23.022805182,"_type":"aimessage"}]
