It iterates over each string, splits it into characters, moves the first letter to the end of the word, and adds \"ay\" at the end. The transformed words are stored in an output vector which is then returned by the function.\n\nThe `Threads.@threads` macro is used to parallelize the loop execution across multiple threads. This allows the iterations to run on separate threads concurrently.","status":200,"tokens":[78,309],"elapsed":16.928255621,"_type":"aimessage"}]
