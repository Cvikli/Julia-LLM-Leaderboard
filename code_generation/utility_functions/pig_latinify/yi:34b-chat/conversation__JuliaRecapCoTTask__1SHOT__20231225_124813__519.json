X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The `pig_latinify` function then uses `@threads` to apply this transformation to each word in the vector simultaneously, printing out the result.\n\nPlease note that the `@threads` macro should be used judiciously, as it can introduce race conditions if the code is not thread-safe. In this example, since we are only processing strings and there's no shared mutable state, we can safely use parallelism. However, always ensure that your code is thread-safe when using `@threads`.","status":200,"tokens":[382,558],"elapsed":82.490159708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
