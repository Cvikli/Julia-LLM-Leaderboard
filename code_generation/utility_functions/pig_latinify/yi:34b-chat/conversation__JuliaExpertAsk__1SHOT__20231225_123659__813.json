The `pig_latinize` function is a simple implementation of the pig latin transformation. It should be modified to check if a letter is a vowel before adding \"ay\" to the word. The `is_vowel` function needs to be implemented to actually check for vowels.","status":200,"tokens":[108,372],"elapsed":50.141844167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
