It uses the `@threads` macro to run the translation of each string to Pig Latin in parallel using multiple threads. The `nthreads` variable is used to ensure that the number of threads spawned does not exceed the total number of threads available on the system.\n\nThe `pig_latinify_thread` function is a worker function that actually performs the pig latin transformation for one string and returns the result. It uses the `split` function to split the input text into words, processes each word using the `process_word` function, and then concatenates them back together with spaces in between.\n\nThe `process_word` function is responsible for transforming a single word according to Pig Latin rules: if the word starts with a vowel, it is suffixed with \"yay\"; otherwise, it is reversed and has its first letter appended at the end.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you are using Julia 1.6 or later, as the `@threads` macro was introduced in that version.","status":200,"tokens":[108,467],"elapsed":62.849791625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
