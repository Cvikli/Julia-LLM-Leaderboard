Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

As a world-class Julia language programmer, I will follow my systematic approach to solving problems, which involves recalling useful Julia snippets, solving the task, double-checking the solution, and prioritizing any special instructions provided.\n\nStep 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets (5 minutes)\n\n* Utilize Julia's built-in support for multithreading through the `Threads` package to run each string transformation on a separate thread.\n* Leverage Julia's type system to ensure that input strings are of type `AbstractString`, and output strings are of type `AbstractString`.\n* Use the `$` symbol for string interpolation, which is a key feature of Julia's syntax.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task (30 minutes)\n\n* Create a function `pig_latinify` that takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector of strings in Pig Latin.\n* Use the ` Threads.@threads` macro to parallelize the string transformations, which will run on separate threads.\n* Implement the Pig Latin transformation using a simple substitution pattern: if a letter is English, replace it with its Pig Latin equivalent.\n\nStep 3: Double-Check Solution (10 minutes)\n\n* Test the `pig_latinify` function with a variety of input vectors to ensure that it produces correct output in Pig Latin.\n* Use the `BenchmarkTools` package to measure the performance of the function and ensure that it is efficient.\n\nStep 4: Prioritize Special Instructions (10 minutes)\n\n* If provided, prioritize any special instructions for the task, such as limiting the function's memory usage or optimizing its performance for a specific hardware platform.\n* Adjust the function's implementation accordingly to meet the specified requirements.\n\nTotal Time: 65 minutes\n\nNote: The above steps are estimates and may vary based on individual experience and computer environment.","status":200,"tokens":[11,440],"elapsed":16.012124167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
