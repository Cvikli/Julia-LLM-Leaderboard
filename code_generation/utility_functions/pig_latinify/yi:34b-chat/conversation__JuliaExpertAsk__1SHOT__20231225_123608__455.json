It's also important to understand that the above code does not implement pig latin translation; it's just a placeholder. You would need to provide the actual logic for translating strings to pig latin within the `translate_string_to_pig_latin` function.","status":200,"tokens":[108,242],"elapsed":33.218086041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
