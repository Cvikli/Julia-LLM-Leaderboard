[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

It uses Julia's multithreading functionality to process each string in parallel using the `@threads` macro, which applies the given function over all elements of an array in threads spawned by `Threads.@spawn`.\n\nThe `pig_latinize` function is a helper function that actually performs the transformation logic for a single string. It accounts for words starting with vowels (which are returned as-is), handles \"qu\" as a special case, and moves the rest of the word to the end followed by \"ay\".\n\nPlease note that multithreading in this way is not always beneficial due to thread overhead and can actually lead to slower performance for small tasks or when the cost of context switching outweighs the benefits of parallelization. However, for large strings or vector operations where the work per element is significant, multithreading can provide a speedup.","status":200,"tokens":[380,657],"elapsed":96.178330875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
