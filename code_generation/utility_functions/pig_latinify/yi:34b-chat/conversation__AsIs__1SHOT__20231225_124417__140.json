Then it creates a `PigLatinifyThreadedTransformer` class which contains the logic for threading. The `transform` method is used to push each word into a queue, and the `join` method waits for all threads to finish before exiting the program.\n\nPlease note that this code is a basic example and may need further refinement depending on your specific requirements. For instance, you might want to add error handling in case of threading issues or if the queue is accessed simultaneously by multiple threads.","status":200,"tokens":[66,646],"elapsed":85.706621167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
