X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Creating and using functions\n2. Multithreading with Julia's Base.Threads module\n3. String manipulation (splitting and concatenating strings)\n\nNow, let's solve the problem by writing the `pig_latinify` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    first_letter :: Union{Char, SubArray{Char, 1}} = str[1]\n    \n    latin_words = map(x -> x -> begin\n        latin_word = string(x)\n        latin_index = findfirst(r\"^[aeiouAEIOU]$\", latin_word)\n        latin_prefix = latin_word[2:latin_index - 1]\n        latin_suffix = latin_word[latin_index + 1:end]\n        \n        if isnothing(latin_prefix)\n            \"\"\n        else\n            string(latin_prefix) * string(\"ay\") * string(latin_suffix)\n        end\n    end, words)\n\n    join(latin_words, \" \")\nend\n\nfunction pig_latin_vector(vect::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    threads = Thread[]()\n    result :: AbstractVector{AbstractString} = copy(vect)\n\n    for (i, str) in enumerate(result)\n        push!(threads, @spawnat at_thread(:local, pig_latinify, str))\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(threads)\n        result[i] = fetch(threads[i])\n        deleteat!(threads, i)\n    end\n\n    result\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes an AbstractString as input, splits it into words using `split()`, and then applies pig latin transformation to each word. The `pig_latin_vector` function takes a vector of strings as input, creates separate threads for each string using Julia's multithreading functionality, and finally merges the results back together in the main thread.\n\nBoth functions should correctly apply pig latin transformations to their respective inputs. To test this, you can use a simple REPL session or write some tests with `@test` macros from JuliaTest package if available.","status":200,"tokens":[370,624],"elapsed":21.905778458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
