X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Multithreading using Julia's `Threads` module.\n   - Function definitions and anonymous functions.\n   - Array processing and vectorization.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\nFirst, let's define a helper function called `pig_latin` which takes a single string as an argument and converts it to pig latin.\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(str::AbstractString)\n    first_letter = str[1]\n    consonants = [\"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"g\", \"h\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]\n    initial_consonants = any(x -> x == first_letter, consonants)\n    \n    if initial_consonants\n        a = split(str, first_letter)[2]\n        return string(first_letter, \"ay\", a)\n    else\n        return string(str[2:], first_letter, \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNext, we will create the main function called `pig_latinify`. This function takes an array of strings as an argument and applies pig latin transformation to each element in parallel using threads.\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latinify(arr::AbstractArray{<:AbstractString})\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(arr)\n        Threads.@threaded begin\n            arr[i] = pig_latin(arr[i])\n        end\n    end\n    return arr\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Run some test cases to ensure the code works as intended and meets the requirements of the problem statement.","status":200,"tokens":[372,458],"elapsed":16.352575833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
