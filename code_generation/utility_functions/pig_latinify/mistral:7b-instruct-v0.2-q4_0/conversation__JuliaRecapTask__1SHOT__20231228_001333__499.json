X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here is how to implement it:\n\n1. First, let's recall some useful Julia snippets for this task:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads # Import multithreading functionality\nfunction pig_latin(str::AbstractString) # Function to convert a single string to pig latin\n    first_letter = str[1]\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    if first_letter ∈ vowels\n        return string(\"way\", str[2:])\n    else\n        return join(Threads.atf([() -> (str[1], str[2:])], length(str)) do thread_result\n            first, rest = thread_result\n            new_first = isfirstvowel(rest[1]) ? rest : string(rest[1], \"ay\")\n            return string(first, new_first)\n        end...)\n    end\nend\nfunction isfirstvowel(char::Char) # Helper function to check if a character is a vowel\n    char ∈ [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\nend\n```\n\n2. Now, let's implement the main function `pig_latinify`:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(input::Vector{AbstractString}) # Function to transform a vector of strings using multithreading\n    output = Array{AbstractString}(length(input)) # Preallocate an array to store the results\n    Threads.@threads for (i, str) in enumerate(input)\n        output[i] = pig_latin(str)\n    end\n    return output\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe above code creates a `pig_latinify` function that accepts a vector of strings as input, runs each string through the `pig_latin` function in a separate thread, and returns an array with the transformed strings as output. The `pig_latin` function checks if the first character is a vowel, then transforms the string accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[370,542],"elapsed":19.124274834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
