Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Create a pig latin transformation function for single strings.\n   - Write a multi-threaded version of the function to process multiple strings concurrently.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latin(str::String)\n    first_letter = str[1]\n    consonants = [\"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"g\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]\n    index = findfirst(x -> x in consonants, str)\n    \n    if isnothing(index)\n        return string(\"ai\", str[2:])\n    else\n        return string(str[index+1:], first_letter, \"ay\", str[1:index-1])\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(arr::Vector{String})\n    using Threads\n    threads = Thread[]()\n    \n    for str in arr\n        push!(threads, Thread(pig_latin, str))\n    end\n    \n    for thread in threads\n        wait(thread)\n        arr[findfirst(x -> x === thread.data, arr)] = thread.result\n    end\n    \n    return arr\nend\n```\n\n3.
