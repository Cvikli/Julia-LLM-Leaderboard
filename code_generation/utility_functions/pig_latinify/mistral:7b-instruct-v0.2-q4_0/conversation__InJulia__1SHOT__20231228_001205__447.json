Below is the code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction initial_letter(str)\n    return str[1]\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinize(str)\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    first_letter = initial_letter(str)\n\n    if iselement(vowels, first_letter)\n        return string(\"\", str[2:end]) .* string(\"way\", first_letter)\n    else\n        return string(str[2:end], string(first_letter), \"ay\")\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(strs::Vector{String})\n    @show Threads.nthreads()\n    threads = Vector{Thread}(length(strs))\n\n    for (i, str) in enumerate(strs)\n        push!(threads, Thread(pig_latinize, str))\n    end\n\n    results = []\n    for thread in threads\n        pushfirst!(results, thread.result)\n        Threads.wait(thread)\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThe `pig_latinify` function takes a vector of strings as an argument and creates one thread for each string. The pig Latin transformation is done in the helper function called `pig_latinize`. Since Julia doesn't have built-in support for pig Latin transformation, we assume that if the first character of a string is a vowel, we simply move all letters before the first vowel to the end and add \"way\" and the initial letter. Otherwise, we add the remaining characters, append the initial letter, and add \"ay\".\n\nThe code above does not account for multiple-letter words that start with consonant clusters like \"str\", \"thr\", etc. In such cases, you might want to improve the `pig_latinify` function by implementing additional logic for handling consonant clusters or using a library providing pig Latin transformation support in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[64,496],"elapsed":15.500996958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
