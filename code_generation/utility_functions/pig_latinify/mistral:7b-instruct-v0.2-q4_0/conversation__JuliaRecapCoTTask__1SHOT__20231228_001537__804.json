X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets:\n   ```julia\n   using Threads\n   function pig_latinify(str::AbstractString) end\n   function pig_latin_threaded(arr::Array{AbstractString})\n       Threads.@threads for str in arr\n           pig_latinify(str)\n       end\n   end\n   ```\n2. Solve the Task:\n   - Create a helper function `pig_latinify` that takes an AbstractString as an argument and returns nothing (a void function).\n      You'll implement this function later to transform strings into pig latin.\n   - Wrap the helper function inside a multithreaded function called `pig_latin_threaded`, which accepts an Array{AbstractString} as its only argument.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Ensure that the helper function `pig_latinify` transforms strings correctly into pig latin.\n   - Check if the multithreaded function `pig_latin_threaded` applies the helper function to every string in the input array concurrently using threads.\n\nTo write the implementation for the `pig_latinify` function, refer to this example:\n\n```julia\nfunction pig_latinify(str::AbstractString)\n    words = split(str, \" \")\n    latin = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        first_letter = word[1]\n        consonants = [\"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"g\", \"h\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]\n        index = findfirst(x -> x in first_letter, consonants)\n        \n        if isnothing(index)\n            push!(latin, word)\n        else\n            push!(latin, string(\"ai\") * substring(word, index:end))\n            push!(latin, substring(word, 1:index-1))\n        end\n        \n    end\n    \n    join(latin, \" \")\nend\n```\n\nThis `pig_latinify` function accepts a string as an argument and returns the transformed pig latin version. It first splits the input string by white spaces to get individual words. Then it iterates through each word and checks if its first letter is a vowel or consonant. Based on that, it appends the corresponding transformed part to a list. Finally, it joins all the parts back together and returns the resulting pig latin string.\n\nNow you can use `pig_latin_threaded` function with an array of strings as follows:\n\n```julia\narr = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\npig_latin_threaded(arr)\n```\n\nThis will transform all strings in the array concurrently using threads.","status":200,"tokens":[372,740],"elapsed":25.877847334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
