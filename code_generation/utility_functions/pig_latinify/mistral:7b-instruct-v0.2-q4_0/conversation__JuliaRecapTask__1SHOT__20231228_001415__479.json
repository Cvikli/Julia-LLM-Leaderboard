Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

Here are the steps to create a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify`:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction pig_latin(word :: AbstractString) :: AbstractString\n    vowels = [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]\n    first_letter = word[1]\n\n    if isfirstletter(first_letter, vowels)\n        return string(string(word)[2:], first_letter, \"ay\")\n    else\n        index :: Int = findfirst(x -> x == first_letter, word)\n        prefix :: AbstractString = word[1:index - 1]\n        suffix :: AbstractString = word[index+1:end]\n\n        return string(suffix, string(\"a\", repeat(\"ay\", length(prefix))))\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(str_vector :: Vector{AbstractString})\n    threads = Threads.Thread[]\n\n    for word in str_vector\n        push!(threads, Threads.@spawn pig_latin, word)\n    end\n\n    results = Vector{AbstractString}(undef, length(str_vector))\n\n    for (i, thread) in enumerate(threads)\n        results[i] = Threads.join(thread)\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\nThe `pig_latin` function takes an abstract string as input and converts it to pig latin by checking if the first letter is a vowel or consonant, then applying the pig latin transformation accordingly. The `pig_latinify` function creates threads for each word in the vector and processes them concurrently using Julia's multi-threading capabilities.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n@testset \"Pig latin transformer\" begin\n    str_vector = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cat\"]\n    expected = [\"appleay eple\", \"anabanay a banana\", \"atcay at cat\"]\n\n    @test pig_latinify(str_vector) == expected\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[370,547],"elapsed":19.29521975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
