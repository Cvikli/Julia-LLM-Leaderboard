X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

The function will transform each string in the input vector to Pig Latin using multiple threads. Let's breakdown the task according to the specified problem-solving steps:\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets That Will Be Useful for This Task\n\n- **Threads**: Julia supports concurrent execution through multi-threading. We can use `Threads.@threads` for parallel execution of loops.\n- **String and Array Operations**: We'll deal with strings, so functions like `split`, `join`, and basic string manipulation (`*` operator for concatenation) will be crucial.\n- **Pig Latin Transformation Logic**: The basic rule is to take the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, move it to the end of the word, and add \"ay\". If the word begins with a vowel, add \"way\" or \"yay\" at the end instead.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\nTo solve the task, we will create the `pig_latinify` function implementing the Pig Latin logic and applying it concurrently on each element of the input vector. The transformation needs to consider whether a word starts with a vowel or a consonant.\n\n### Implement `pig_latinify`\n\n```julia\nusing Threads\n\nfunction is_vowel(ch::Char)\n    return ch in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']\nend\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString)\n    if is_vowel(word[1])\n        return word * \"way\"\n    else\n        for (index, char) in enumerate(word)\n            if is_vowel(char)\n                return word[index:end] * word[1:index-1] * \"ay\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return word\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    pig_latin_words = similar(words)\n    Threads.@threads for i in 1:length(words)\n        pig_latin_words[i] = to_pig_latin(words[i])\n    end\n    return pig_latin_words\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check the Solution Is Correct\n\nTo ensure the proposed solution is correct, let's run a few test cases:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"hello\", \"algorithm\", \"under\", \"eagle\", \"drama\"]\npig_latinified = pig_latinify(words)\n\nprintln(pig_latinified)  # Expected output: [\"ellohay\", \"algorithmway\", \"underway\", \"eagleway\", \"amadray\"]\n```\n\nThe implementation should correctly convert each string in the input vector to its Pig Latin equivalent. Each word's transformation is processed in a separate thread, enhancing the function's performance, especially for large input vectors.","status":200,"tokens":[319,595],"elapsed":51.919249459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
