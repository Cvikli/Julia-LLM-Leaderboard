X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a pig latin transformer called `pig_latinify` that operates on a vector of strings.

We'll need to ensure Julia is started with multiple threads (e.g., `julia -t auto` for automatically using available cores).\n- **Manipulating Strings**: For the transformation to Pig Latin:\n  - If a word begins with a vowel sound, \"ay\" is added to the end (e.g., \"apple\" becomes \"appleay\").\n  - If a word begins with a consonant sound, that sound is moved to the end followed by \"ay\" (e.g., \"banana\" becomes \"ananabay\").\n- **Working with Arrays**: We will iterate over a vector of strings, transforming each one according to the Pig Latin rules.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\nFirst, let's define the `pig_latinify` function which takes a vector of strings. For each string, we'll perform the transformation on a separate thread and collect the results.\n\n```julia\nusing Base.Threads\n\nfunction to_pig_latin(word::AbstractString) :: AbstractString\n    # Determine if the first letter is a vowel\n    if occursin(r\"^[aeiouAEIOU]\", word)\n        return word * \"ay\"\n    else\n        # Move the first consonant cluster to the end and append \"ay\"\n        match = match(r\"^[^aeiouAEIOU]+\", word)\n        if match !== nothing\n            return word[length(match.match)+1:end] * match.match * \"ay\"\n        else\n            return word * \"ay\"\n        end\n    end\nend\n\nfunction pig_latinify(words::Vector{AbstractString}) :: Vector{AbstractString}\n    # Use multi-threading for transforming each word\n    transformed_futures = [Threads.@spawn to_pig_latin(word) for word in words]\n    return [fetch(f) for f in transformed_futures]\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check That the Solution Is Correct\n\nWe need to ensure that each component of the solution functions as expected. This will involve testing both functions individually.\n\n1. **Test `to_pig_latin` Function**\n   - Test with a word starting with a vowel.\n   - Test with a word starting with a consonant.\n   - Test with a word starting with a consonant cluster.\n\n2. **Test `pig_latinify` Function**\n   - Use a vector containing a mixture of words that start with vowels and consonants.\n\n**Example Test:**\n\n```julia\nprintln(pig_latinify([\"apple\", \"banana\", \"school\"]))\n# Expected Output: [\"appleay\", \"ananabay\", \"oolschay\"]\n```\n\nBefore running the code, ensure Julia is started with multiple threading enabled to utilize `Threads.@spawn` effectively.","status":200,"tokens":[319,613],"elapsed":80.495758667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
