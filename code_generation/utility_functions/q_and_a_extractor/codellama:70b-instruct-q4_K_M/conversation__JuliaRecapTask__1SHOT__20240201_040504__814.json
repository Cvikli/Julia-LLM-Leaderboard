[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any questions or require further assistance. ðŸ˜Š\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = match(r\"^# Question\\n+(\\S.*)$\", md, Base.MATCH_ONLY).match[1]\n    answer = match(r\"^# Answer\\n+(\\S.*)$\", md, Base.MATCH_ONLY).match[1]\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a single argument `md`, which represents the markdown text provided by the user.\n- Within this function, we use Julia's built-in regular expression engine to extract the required information from the input text using the `match()` function. This function takes three arguments: \n  1) The regex pattern to be matched against (a string enclosed in `r\"\"` delimiters). In our case, this is a pattern that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, followed by one or more newlines (`\\n+`), and ends with at least one non-space character (`(\\S.*)`). The parentheses around `\\S.*` are used to capture the text following these patterns as a group. \n  2) The input string, `md`. \n  3) An optional argument `Base.MATCH_ONLY`, which limits the search for matches to only the first occurrence of the pattern.\n- The `match()` function returns an object containing information about the match. We use the `.match` field to extract the captured text (the text following `# Question` and `# Answer`) from the match. Since we're using `Base.MATCH_ONLY`, only the first occurrence of each pattern will be extracted, as required by your task specification.\n- The resulting text is then assigned to the variables `question` and `answer`.\n- Finally, a tuple containing both strings (`(question, answer)`) is returned from the function.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that: \n1) There will only be one occurrence of each pattern in the input text. If there are multiple occurrences, only the first one will be extracted.\n2) The input text will always conform to the expected structure (e.g., starting with `# Question` and ending with `# Answer`). If it doesn't, the function may return incorrect results or error out.\n\nIf you have any questions or require further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask! ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,590],"elapsed":32.055184369,"_type":"aimessage"}]
