Then you can create a regular expression (regex) pattern to capture only questions that begin with \"Question\". Here is an example of how you can approach this problem.\n\n```julia-repl\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split the markdown text into sections based on the header ##\n    sections = split(md, r\"##\\s*\")\n\n    # Create a regex pattern to capture only questions that begin with \"Question\"\n    question_pattern = r\"^(Question).*\"is\n\n    for section in sections\n        if occursin(question_pattern, section)\n            return (strip.(split(section, \"\\n\"))[2], strip.(split(section, \"\\n\"))[4]) # Return a tuple of question and answer\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, I am using `occursin` to check if the section contains a string that begins with \"Question\". If it does, then I return a tuple containing the question (second line) and answer (fourth line). The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":14.593615825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
