It first splits the markdown string into individual lines, then loops through each line and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it extracts the text after the hash using `split`, strips any leading spaces or newlines using `strip`, and sets the question or answer in the tuple. Finally, the function returns the extracted tuple containing the question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,400],"elapsed":3.331593309,"_type":"aimessage"}]
