[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Then it splits the remaining lines into separate questions and answers using `split` and `strip`. Finally, it returns the extracted questions and answers in a tuple.\n\nTo use this function, you can pass in the markdown-formatted text as an argument:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is the first question.\n\n# Answer 1\nThis is the first answer.\n\n# Question 2\nThis is the second question.\n\n# Answer 2\nThis is the second answer.\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md) # ([\"Question 1\", \"Question 2\"], [\"Answer 1\", \"Answer 2\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":3.201131269,"_type":"aimessage"}]
