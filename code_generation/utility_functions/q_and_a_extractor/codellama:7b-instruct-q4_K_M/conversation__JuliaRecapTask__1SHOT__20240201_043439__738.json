[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It first splits the markdown text into lines using the `split` function, and then iterates over each line in the text. For each line, it checks if it starts with the `# Question` or `# Answer` section markers, and if so, sets the current section to be either the question or answer string. Finally, it returns a tuple with the extracted question and answer.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and follows the specified format (i.e., each Question section starts with `# Question` and each Answer section starts with `# Answer`). If the input text is not well-formed or does not follow the specified format, this function may produce incorrect results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,392],"elapsed":3.353403481,"_type":"aimessage"}]
