It first splits the text into an array of lines using the `\\n` character. Then, it iterates over each line in the array and checks if the current line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it sets the appropriate variable (question or answer) to the next line. Finally, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. This is useful because markdown formatting can sometimes include additional characters that we don't want in our output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,358],"elapsed":2.985519331,"_type":"aimessage"}]
