Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n```julia\nmodule QAndA\nexport q_and_a_extractor\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Parse markdown text\n    p = JMarkdown.parse(md)\n    \n    # Extract Question and Answer sections\n    question = replace(p.body, \"# Question \\\\([^\\\\n]++)\").strip()\n    answer = replace(p.body, \"# Answer \\\\([^\\\\n]++)\").strip()\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nHere's a breakdown of how the function works:\n\n1. `JMarkdown.parse(md)` parses the markdown text `md` using the JMarkdown library. This creates a `JMarkdown.Node` object representing the parsed Markdown content.\n2. `replace(p.body, \"# Question \\\\([^\\\\n]++)\").strip()` replaces all occurrences of `# Question` followed by any characters other than newlines and spaces with an empty string, leaving only the text inside the hash marks. This extracts the question section.\n3. `replace(p.body, \"# Answer \\\\([^\\\\n]++)\").strip()` repeats the same process for the answer section, replacing `# Answer` with an empty string.\n4. The function returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer text, stripped of leading spaces and newlines using `strip()`.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with a markdown-formatted string as input, like so:\n```julia\nusing QAndA\n\nmd = \"# Question: What is your name?\\n# Answer: My name is Julia\"\n(question, answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md) # extract question and answer\nprintln(question) # prints \"What is your name?\"\nprintln(answer) # prints \"My name is Julia\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[128,440],"elapsed":15.498455834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
