[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's break down the problem into smaller steps to solve it systematically:\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n\n* Functions for parsing markdown: `Markdown.parse` and `Markdown.render` from the standard library\n* Anonymous functions for extracting text: `x -> s`\n\nStep 2: Solve the task\n\n1. Use `Markdown.parse` to parse the given Markdown text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\n2. Traverse the AST to find all markdown sections with the label `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Extract the text from each of these sections using anonymous functions as before.\n4. Return the extracted text in a tuple like `(question, answer)`.\n5. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nStep 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\n1. Test the function with several examples to ensure it works correctly.\n2. Check that the resulting tuple contains only the desired text from the markdown sections.\n\nNow, let's write the code for `q_and_a_extractor`. Here's an example implementation:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md) = (question, answer) = (parse(Markdown.render(md)).sections .|> filter(x -> x.label == \"Question\" || x.label == \"Answer\"));\n    // Extract text from each section\n    question = replace(question, \"\\n\", \"\") |> trim;\n    answer = replace(answer, \"\\n\", \"\") |> trim;\nend\n```\nIn this implementation:\n\n* `parse(Markdown.render(md))` parses the given Markdown text into an AST using the `Markdown.render` function from the standard library.\n* `.|> filter()` filters the AST to only include sections with the labels `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n* `.|> replace()` replaces any leading newlines with an empty string, and trimms any trailing newlines from the extracted text.\n\nWith this implementation, we can now call `q_and_a_extractor` with a Markdown string as input, and it will return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.
