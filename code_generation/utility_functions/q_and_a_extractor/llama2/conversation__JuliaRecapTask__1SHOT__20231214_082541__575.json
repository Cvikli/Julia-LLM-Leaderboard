[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, let's get started! Based on the problem statement and guidelines provided, here are the steps I will follow to solve this task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* Standard libraries such as `Markdown` and `StringTransformations`\n\t* Control structures such as `if-elseif-else`, `for`, and `while`\n\t* Functions and anonymous functions\n\t* Array and slicing operations\n\t* Tuples and namedtuples\n\t* Dictionaries and key-value pairs\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Use the `Markdown` package to parse the markdown text `md` into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)\n\t* Traverse the AST using a combination of recursion and iteration to extract the Question and Answer sections\n\t* Use the `StringTransformations` package to strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n\t* Return the question and answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with various inputs to ensure it produces the correct output\n\t* Use print statements or other debugging tools to verify that the function is working as expected\n\nHere's an example implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n```julia\nusing Markdown, StringTransformations\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Parse markdown text into AST\n    ast = parse(Markdown, md)\n\n    # Extract Question and Answer sections\n    question = \"\"; answer = \"\"\n    for node in ast\n        if node.type == :section && node.name == \"Question\"\n            question = node.text\n        elseif node.type == :section && node.name == \"Answer\"\n            answer = node.text\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from extracted text\n    strip_spaces(question)\n    strip_spaces(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\nfunction strip_spaces(str::AbstractString)\n    # Remove leading spaces using StringTransformations\n    str = replace(str, r\"^ *\", \"\")\nend\n```\nI hope this helps!
