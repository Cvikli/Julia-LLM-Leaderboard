[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's break down the problem into steps and solve it using our systematic approach:\n\nStep 1: Recall Julia Snippets (5 minutes)\n\n* Review the Julia language syntax and key features to ensure we can write efficient code.\n* Check if there are any useful Julia snippets that can be reused for this task, such as `split`, `splitlines`, `readstring`, or `captures`.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task (30 minutes)\n\n1. Parse the markdown text to identify the markdown sections.\n2. Implement a function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the text from the markdown sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Use regular expressions or the `Regex` package in Julia to extract the text from the markdown sections.\n4. Store the extracted text in a tuple like `(question, answer)`.\n5. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nStep 3: Double-check the Solution (10 minutes)\n\n1. Test the function with different input markdown texts to ensure it works correctly.\n2. Check that the extracted question and answer are correct and well-formatted.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n```julia\nimport Regexp\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Use regular expressions to extract the text from markdown sections\n    question = Regexp.matchall(r\"# Question\", md)\n    answer = Regexp.matchall(r\"# Answer\", md)\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nNote: This implementation uses the `Regexp` package in Julia to perform regular expression matching. You can also use other packages such as `Markdown` or `Duktape` for this task.","status":200,"tokens":[399,450],"elapsed":19.998104958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
