Let's get started. Here's my approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n\t* Identify the markdown sections in the given text (`# Question` and `# Answer`).\n\t* Extract the text from each section separately.\n\t* Return the answer in a tuple like `(question, answer)`.\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\t* `q_and_a_extractor()` function to extract the text from the markdown sections.\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Implement the `q_and_a_extractor()` function using regular expressions or another suitable method.\n\t* Test the function with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the extracted text is correct and stripped of any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nHere's the implementation of `q_and_a_extractor()` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(text)\n    # Use regular expressions to extract the text from markdown sections\n    question = match(r\" `# Question([\\s\\S]*?)# Answer\", text).groups[1]\n    answer = match(r\" `# Answer([\\s\\S]*?)\", text).groups[1]\n\n    # Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!","status":200,"tokens":[1,356],"elapsed":12.075870166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
