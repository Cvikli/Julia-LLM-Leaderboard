[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's start by breaking down the problem into concrete steps:\n\n1. Define a function `q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)` that takes a single string argument. This argument represents the markdown-formatted text.\n2. Split the markdown text into sections where each section starts with either `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n3. Extract the content for the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n4. Clean the extracted text by stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n5. Return the clean question and answer content as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nNow let's convert these steps into Julia code:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    capturing = nothing  # can be :question or :answer to know which part we are capturing\n\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if we are starting to capture question or answer\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            capturing = :question\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            capturing = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # Capture the line if we are inside question or answer section\n        if capturing == :question\n            push!(question, line)\n        elseif capturing == :answer\n            push!(answer, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join lines and strip unnecessary whitespace from the question and answer\n    question_text = strip(join(question, \"\\n\"))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer, \"\\n\"))\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\nBefore we assure the solution is correct, let's check if there's any subtlety or edge case we're missing:\n\n- Multiline Q&A: The solution should handle multi-line questions and answers correctly.\n- Consecutive Q&A sections: If there are multiple question or answer sections, our current solution concatenates them. However, we are only given the context of extracting sections, not how to handle multiple sections. This might require further clarification.\n- Nested sections: Since we aren't provided with specifics, we assume there aren't nested sections to handle.\n\nWith that in mind, let's consider the solution as it handles the requirements we've been given. If the markdown contains a single set of Question and Answer sections, our solution will extract and clean them.\n\nWe could refine various parts, such as using regex to detect headers more accurately, but as per the task description, the current solution meets the requirements. Therefore, we conclude that the solution above should work correctly for the given task.","status":200,"tokens":[349,542],"elapsed":19.342632708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
