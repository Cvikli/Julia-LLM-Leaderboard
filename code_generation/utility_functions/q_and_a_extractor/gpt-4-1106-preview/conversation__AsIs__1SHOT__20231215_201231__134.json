Below is a Python function that takes a markdown-formatted string `md` and extracts the text from the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. It returns a tuple containing the question and answer with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Define regex patterns for question and answer sections\n    question_pattern = r'# Question\\s*(.+?)(?=\\n#|$)'\n    answer_pattern = r'# Answer\\s*(.+?)(?=\\n#|$)'\n\n    # Search for question and answer using the regex patterns\n    question_match = re.search(question_pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n    answer_match = re.search(answer_pattern, md, re.DOTALL)\n\n    # Extract the question and answer text if matches are found\n    question = question_match.group(1).strip() if question_match else None\n    answer = answer_match.group(1).strip() if answer_match else None\n\n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the question and answer\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprint(q_and_a)  # Output should be: ('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to find the sections of text that follow `# Question` and `# Answer` headings. It assumes that each section is followed by another heading or the end of the string. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used so that the `.` character in the regex patterns matches newline characters, allowing the function to capture multi-line questions and answers. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace and newlines from the captured text.","status":200,"tokens":[88,396],"elapsed":28.205755291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
