The function uses regular expressions to find the sections and assumes that the markdown uses `# Question` and `# Answer` as the exact headers for the sections:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Define regex patterns for Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r'^\\# Question\\n(.*?)\\n(?=^\\#|\\Z)'\n    answer_pattern = r'^\\# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n(?=^\\#|\\Z)'\n\n    # Search for question and answer using regex\n    question_search = re.search(question_pattern, md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n    answer_search = re.search(answer_pattern, md, re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL)\n\n    # Extract the question and answer if found\n    question = question_search.group(1).strip() if question_search else None\n    answer = answer_search.group(1).strip() if answer_search else None\n\n    # Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_example = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md_example))\n```\n\nThis function would output:\n\n```\n('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```\n\nThe regex patterns used in the function assume that there is a newline character after the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers and that the question and answer text sections are followed by either another header (like `# SomethingElse`) or the end of the string (`\\Z`). The `re.MULTILINE` flag allows `^` to match the start of each line, and the `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot `.` to match newline characters, which is necessary to capture multi-line questions or answers. The `.strip()` method removes any leading or trailing whitespaces and newlines from the extracted strings. If the pattern is not found, the function safely returns `None` for that section instead of causing an error.","status":200,"tokens":[88,483],"elapsed":19.224307291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
