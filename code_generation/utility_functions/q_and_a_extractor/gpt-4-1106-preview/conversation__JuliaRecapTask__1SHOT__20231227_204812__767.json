[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, first we'll need to write the function `q_and_a_extractor` that will parse the given markdown-formatted `md` text. The outline of the approach is:\n\n1. Split the `md` text into lines.\n2. Loop through the lines to find the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. \n3. Record the indices of these starting points.\n4. Extract the relevant text for the question and answer by capturing the content after these headings and before the next heading.\n5. Clean the captured text by removing any leading or trailing whitespace or newlines.\n6. Return the cleaned text as a tuple.\n\nNow, let's write the function.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question_start = answer_start = -1\n    question_end = answer_end = -1\n\n    # Detect the start and end of Question and Answer\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_start = i\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer_start = i\n        end\n\n        # Assuming that another heading marks the end of the current section\n        if question_start != -1 && answer_start == -1 && startswith(line, \"#\") && !startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_end = i - 1\n        elseif answer_start != -1 && startswith(line, \"#\") && !startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer_end = i - 1\n            break  # We can exit the loop once we have found the end of the Answer\n        end\n    end\n\n    if question_end == -1\n        question_end = answer_start != -1 ? answer_start - 1 : length(lines)\n    end\n    if answer_end == -1\n        answer_end = length(lines)\n    end\n\n    # Extract and clean the text\n    question_lines = lines[question_start+1:question_end]\n    answer_lines = lines[answer_start+1:answer_end]\n    question = strip(join(question_lines, '\\n'))\n    answer = strip(join(answer_lines, '\\n'))\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function is of course a bit simplified. Markdown does not have a standard way to mark the end of a section, but in this problem, I'm assuming that any new heading marks the end of the previous section unless it's the same as the current section's heading. This function also does not handle edge cases like headings not being at the start of the line (which could happen with indented blocks), or multiple Questions and Answers sections.\n\nNow let's test it with some sample markdown text:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Another section\n\"\"\"\n\n# Now let's test the function\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(result)  # Expected: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n``` \n\nThis code assumes that the markdown text contains one Question and one Answer section; additional sections are ignored. We can refine the approach further if the problem statement requires handling of multiple Q&A sections.","status":200,"tokens":[348,678],"elapsed":40.655246083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
