Below is a Python function called `q_and_a_extractor` that processes the markdown-formatted string `md`. It looks for the sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer` and then extracts the text for each section, stripping any leading or trailing spaces and newlines. Here is the code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Compile regex patterns for question and answer sections\n    question_pattern = re.compile(r'# Question\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)', re.DOTALL)\n    answer_pattern = re.compile(r'# Answer\\n(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)', re.DOTALL)\n    \n    # Search for question and answer text using regex patterns\n    question_match = question_pattern.search(md)\n    answer_match = answer_pattern.search(md)\n    \n    # Extract and strip whitespaces and newlines from question and answer text\n    question = question_match.group(1).strip() if question_match else ''\n    answer = answer_match.group(1).strip() if answer_match else ''\n    \n    # Return the question and answer\n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Example usage:\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Title\nThis is the title of the document.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the color of the sky?\n\n# Answer\nThe color of the sky is blue.\n\n# Another Section\nMore text that is not part of the answer.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprint(q_and_a)  # Output: ('What is the color of the sky?', 'The color of the sky is blue.')\n```\n\nThis function uses the `re` module to compile regular expression patterns for identifying the sections that follow `# Question` and `# Answer`. It assumes that each section starts with its title line followed by a newline character `\\n`, and it stops capturing text once it encounters either another markdown header (denoted by `#`) or the end of the string (denoted by `|$`). The `(?=...)` syntax is a positive lookahead assertion in the regex pattern that ensures we match up to, but not including, this delimiter. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot `.` to match newline characters as well, which enables the pattern to capture multi-line question and answer sections.\n\nAfter capturing the matched text for the question and answer, the function strips out any leading or trailing white spaces or line breaks and then returns the results as a tuple. If either a question or an answer is not found, it returns an empty string for that part.","status":200,"tokens":[88,523],"elapsed":17.7497445,"_type":"aimessage"}]
