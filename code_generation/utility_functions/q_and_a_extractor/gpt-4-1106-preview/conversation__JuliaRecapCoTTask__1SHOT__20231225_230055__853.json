[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Let's write a function in Julia that will read the provided markdown-formatted text and extract the text under the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings accordingly.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_start_idx = findnext(r\"# Question\\s*(.*)\", md, 1)\n    answer_start_idx = findnext(r\"# Answer\\s*(.*)\", md, 1)\n\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Check if both Question and Answer sections are found\n    if question_start_idx !== nothing && answer_start_idx !== nothing\n        \n        # Extract the text for the Question section\n        question_end_idx = answer_start_idx[1] - 1 # Assume that Answer follows Question\n        question = md[question_start_idx[1]:question_end_idx]\n        question = replace(question, r\"# Question\\s*\" => \"\")\n        \n        # Extract the text for the Answer section\n        answer_start_pos = answer_start_idx[1]\n        answer = md[answer_start_pos:end] # Assume Answer section goes until the end\n        answer = replace(answer, r\"# Answer\\s*\" => \"\")\n    end\n\n    # Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text for both question and answer\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` uses regular expressions to identify the sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer`, captures the text following them, and strips any leading whitespace or newlines. It returns the question and answer texts in a tuple. If either the question or answer section is missing, that part of the returned tuple will be an empty string.\n\nTime to perform a double-check:\n\n1. Test the function with markdown text containing properly formatted `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n2. Test with text where these sections are not clearly marked or not present at all.\n3. Test with multiple questions or answers in the text to see if the function correctly captures only the first occurrence after each section header.\n\nIf any tests fail, we'll refine the regular expressions or the logic in the function to handle missed edge cases.","status":200,"tokens":[349,450],"elapsed":27.310388292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
