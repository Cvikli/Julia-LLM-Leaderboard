[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a string `md` as its input.\n2. Use regular expressions to identify the sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Extract the question and answer sections and return them as a tuple, ensuring we strip any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nHere's how we can write the function step by step:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define the regular expression patterns for the question and answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*(.*?)\\n(?=#)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*(.*?)\\n(?=#|\\z)\"\n    \n    # Search the markdown text using regex to find the question and answer sections\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md; overlap=true)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md; overlap=true)\n    \n    # Extract the text of question and answer, stripping any undesired whitespace\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's detail each step:\n\n- We use the `r\"...\"` syntax to define raw string literals that are used as regex patterns to avoid escaping backslashes.\n- The regex for the question looks for a line starting with `# Question` and captures any text that follows until the next section (denoted by `#`) starts or a newline character is encountered.\n- For the answer, the pattern is similar, except it captures until either the next section starts or the end of the string is reached (`\\z`). This is because there may not be a subsequent section following the answer.\n- The `match` function searches for the first match of the pattern and the `captures` field of the match object contains the captured groups.\n- We use the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the captured text.\n- If no match is found for either section, we return an empty string for that part.\n- We use `overlap=true` to allow subsequent matches to start within previous matches, which is necessary since `# Answer` might immediately follow the `# Question` section.\n\nWeâ€™ll now write the function following these steps.","status":200,"tokens":[348,506],"elapsed":40.307183917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
