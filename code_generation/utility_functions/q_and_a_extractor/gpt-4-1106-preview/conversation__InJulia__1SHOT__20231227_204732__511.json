For simplicity, let's assume that each section contains only one question and one answer, and they appear in that order.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Regex patterns for matching question and answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"(?<=# Question\\n)(.*?)(?=\\n# Answer|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"(?<=# Answer\\n)(.*?)(?=(\\n# Question|$))\"\n    \n    # Try to find the question and answer sections using the patterns\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer if they are found\n    question = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.match) : \"\"\n    answer = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.match) : \"\"\n    \n    # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(q_and_a)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n- The function `q_and_a_extractor` is defined, which takes `md` (the markdown text) as its parameter.\n- We use regular expressions to identify the question and answer sections.\n  - `question_pattern` matches the text after `# Question` and before the next `# Answer` or end of the string, in a non-greedy manner (the smallest possible match).\n  - `answer_pattern` matches the text after `# Answer` and before the next `# Question` or end of the string, also non-greedy.\n- The `match` function is used to search the markdown text with the given patterns.\n- The question and answer are extracted using their respective patterns. If no match is found, empty strings are used as defaults.\n- Both the question and answer are passed through the `strip` function to remove any leading and trailing white space or newlines.\n- The function returns a tuple with the question and answer.\n- An example is provided to demonstrate how to call the `q_and_a_extractor` function.","status":200,"tokens":[91,500],"elapsed":42.185751625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
