Below is a Python function that will parse the given markdown-formatted text and extract the text from the sections marked as \"Question\" and \"Answer\". It assumes that the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings are at the root level (not indented) and that they start each respective section:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Use regular expressions to find Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r'^# Question\\s+(.+?)(?=\\n# |\\n\\Z)'\n    answer_pattern = r'^# Answer\\s+(.+?)(?=\\n# |\\n\\Z)'\n    \n    # Perform a non-greedy search across multiple lines\n    question_match = re.search(question_pattern, md, flags=re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    answer_match = re.search(answer_pattern, md, flags=re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # Extract the texts for the question and answer, stripping any leading spaces/newlines\n    question = question_match.group(1).strip() if question_match else None\n    answer = answer_match.group(1).strip() if answer_match else None\n    \n    # Return tuple of question and answer\n    return (question, answer)\n\n# Example usage:\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md_text))\n```\n\nMake sure to call `q_and_a_extractor` with the markdown text you want to parse.\n\nNote that this function uses regular expressions and looks for the `Question` and `Answer` labels at the start of the line followed by any text until another heading (marked by `# `) or the end of the string is found. The `re.DOTALL` flag allows the dot `.` to match newline characters, and the `re.MULTILINE` flag lets the caret `^` match the start of each line.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simple parser and may not handle more complex markdown scenarios or formatting within the Question/Answer sections. Additional logic would be needed to handle nested content or different heading levels.","status":200,"tokens":[88,443],"elapsed":46.303944791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
