[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Split the markdown text using the headers `# Question` and `# Answer` as delimiters.\n2. Extract the content just after these two headers.\n3. Clean up the extracted text by removing leading and trailing whitespace and newlines.\n\nLet's implement this solution in Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into segments using the 'Question' and 'Answer' headers\n    question_split = split(md, \"# Question\")\n    answer_split = split(md, \"# Answer\")\n\n    # Initialize empty strings for the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Extract the question and answer text if they are available\n    if length(question_split) > 1\n        question = split(question_split[2], \"\\n\", limit=2)[1]\n    end\n\n    if length(answer_split) > 1\n        answer = split(answer_split[2], \"\\n\", limit=2)[1]\n    end\n\n    # Clean up; trim leading and trailing whitespace and newlines\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    # Return the tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function with an example markdown text to ensure it works correctly.\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md_text))  # Expected Output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nPlease note that if there are multiple question and answer headers, this implementation extracts only the text immediately following the first occurrence of each header. If we need to handle multiple questions and answers or consider different formatting nuances, we would need to refine the function further.","status":200,"tokens":[348,394],"elapsed":30.823147917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
