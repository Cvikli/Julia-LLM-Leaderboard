[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown document `md` with many lines. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer as a NamedTuple with keys `question` and `answer`. For a section to be valid, it must start at the beginning of the line. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. Provide example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\n# Define the function 'q_and_a_extractor'\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Define regular expressions for identifying Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"^# Question\\n(.+?)(?=\\n# |\\z)\"sm\n    answer_regex = r\"^# Answer\\n(.+?)(?=\\n# |\\z)\"sm\n    \n    # Attempt to find matches for Questions and Answers\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extract the text, stripping leading spaces and newlines\n    question_text = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match[1]) : \"\"\n    answer_text = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    # Return a NamedTuple with the extracted text\n    return (question = question_text, answer = answer_text)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd_example = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Extra Section\nThis is an extra section that should not be extracted.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract Question and Answer from the markdown document\nextracted_q_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_example)\n\n# Display the extracted Question and Answer\nprintln(\"Question: \", extracted_q_and_a.question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", extracted_q_and_a.answer)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `q_and_a_extractor` function is being used to process a string called `md_example` which contains a markdown document. It extracts everything from the lines immediately following `# Question` and `# Answer` up until the next section header or end-of-file, returning the contents as a `NamedTuple` with keys `question` and `answer`.\n\n`Regex` is used to determine the boundaries of Question and Answer with lookahead to stop at the next heading or end-of-file. The `strip` function is then used to remove any leading and trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nThe output of this function, if run with the provided example markdown document, would be:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```\n\nPlease note that the regular expressions used in this function are simplistic and assume that the input markdown follows a strict pattern with `# Question` and `# Answer` at the beginning of a line. More complex markdown documents with variations of these patterns might not be correctly processed by this function.","status":200,"tokens":[116,506],"elapsed":35.556603083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
