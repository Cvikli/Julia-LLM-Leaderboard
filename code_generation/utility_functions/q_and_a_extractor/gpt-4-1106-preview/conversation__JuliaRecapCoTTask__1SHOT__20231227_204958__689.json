[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! To solve this problem, we will create a Julia function that will extract text from sections marked with `# Question` and `# Answer`. We will assume there's only one Question and one Answer section in the given markdown text. We will use string processing techniques to identify the sections and extract the relevant text.\n\nHere's how the `q_and_a_extractor` function will be implemented:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    mode = :none  # :none, :question, or :answer\n\n    for line in lines\n        if starts_with(line, \"# Question\")\n            mode = :question\n            continue\n        elseif starts_with(line, \"# Answer\")\n            mode = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if mode == :question\n            push!(question, strip(line))\n        elseif mode == :answer\n            push!(answer, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Joins the lines back together, separating them with a space and stripping additional spaces/newlines\n    question_text = strip(join(question, \" \"))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer, \" \"))\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nTo make sure our `q_and_a_extractor` function is working as intended, I'll create a helper function `starts_with` to check if a string starts with a specified prefix, as this function doesn't exist natively in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction starts_with(str::AbstractString, prefix::AbstractString)\n    return startswith(str, prefix)\nend\n```\n\nWe'll use this helper function to identify the lines that mark the beginning of the Question and Answer sections. I will now provide the complete solution including the `starts_with` function and the `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction starts_with(str::AbstractString, prefix::AbstractString)\n    return startswith(str, prefix)\nend\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    mode = :none  # :none, :question, or :answer\n\n    for line in lines\n        if starts_with(line, \"# Question\")\n            mode = :question\n            continue\n        elseif starts_with(line, \"# Answer\")\n            mode = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if mode == :question\n            push!(question, strip(line))\n        elseif mode == :answer\n            push!(answer, strip(line))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Joins the lines back together, separating them with a space and stripping additional spaces/newlines\n    question_text = strip(join(question, \" \"))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer, \" \"))\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nYou can now use this function with any markdown string, and it will return the question and answer text as required.","status":200,"tokens":[349,632],"elapsed":48.383348833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
