We have a large collection of markdown-formatted texts, each containing one question and one answer in separate sections.\n2. We don't know the format or structure of these texts but we assume that they adhere to a consistent pattern described by the `q_and_a_extractor` function given above.\n3. Each text is represented as an object with properties 'md' (the markdown-formatted text) and two methods: 'question()' which returns the question, and 'answer()' which returns the answer.\n4. Your task is to write a program that reads these texts, extracts all questions and answers using `q_and_a_extractor`, and then uses these extracted information to answer some queries.\n5. The queries are as follows:\n\n- Query 1: How many unique questions are there?\n- Query 2: What is the most common length (in number of words) among the answers?\n- Query 3: Which question has the longest answer?\n\nQuestion: Write a Python program that reads these texts, extracts all questions and answers using `q_and_a_extractor`, and then uses this extracted information to answer the above queries.\n\n\n\nDefine a class Text with properties 'md' and methods 'question()', 'answer()'.\nUse regular expressions (regex) in Python to find all the markdown-formatted texts, read them into an object of Text, extract the question and answer using `q_and_a_extractor`, and store these questions and answers into a list. \n\n\nImplement the logic for answering the given queries:\n- Query 1: Count the number of unique questions in the list of extracted questions.\n- Query 2: Find the most common length among all the answers.\n- Query 3: Find the question with the longest answer.\n\nAnswer the above queries based on the data obtained from the extraction process, and return the results as output.","status":200,"tokens":[133,588],"elapsed":15.839921958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
