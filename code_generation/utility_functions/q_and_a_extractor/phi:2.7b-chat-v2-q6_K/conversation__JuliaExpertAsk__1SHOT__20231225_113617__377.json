Your job is to write a function called `q_and_a_extractor()` that will extract and return all questions and answers from the text. \n\nHowever, there's a catch - you can only use the method explained in the conversation above where you iterate through each line of the markdown text and check for certain patterns (like '# Question' or '# Answer'). But unlike the previous conversation, this time you have to handle multiple sections of questions and answers.\n\nAdditionally, these sections are not always immediately after each other, so you will need to keep track of when a new section begins and ends in order to extract all the relevant content. \n\nFinally, there is one more complexity - the markdown text may contain nested sections (like '# Subquestion' or '# Subanswer'), and these should also be treated as separate sections. \n\nYour function must return the answers as a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains a question followed by its answer. If there are no questions in `md`, your function must return `None, None`. \n\nQuestion: Can you write this Python function?\n\n\nWe'll tackle this problem using recursion and tree-of-thought reasoning. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\nDefine a helper method called `get_question_answer()` that takes two parameters - current_section, which keeps track of the current section being processed, and remaining_text, which contains the rest of the text to be processed after removing the current section.\n\nInside this function, we'll first check if there are no more sections in `remaining_text`. If so, that means we've finished processing all questions and answers, so we return an empty tuple.\n\nNext, we'll look for a pattern of '# Question' or '# Answer' at the beginning of the remaining text. We can do this using string slicing and Python's built-in `startswith()` method.\n\nIf we find such a pattern, we add it to the current section (by appending a new empty tuple), and recursively call `get_question_answer(current_section + [], remaining_text[len(pattern)+1:])`. \n\nAfter this recursive call, we need to extract the answer. We'll do this by finding the next occurrence of '# Answer' (similarly using `startswith()` and string slicing) and return a tuple containing the question at the start of the current section and its corresponding answer starting from this index in the remaining text.\n\nWe'll repeat these steps for each new section, until we've gone through all sections in `remaining_text`.\n\nFinally, we handle the case where there are nested sections. We'll do this by checking if a '# Subquestion' or '# Subanswer' occurs at the start of our remaining text. If it does, we'll recursively call `get_question_answer()` on that sub-section and include its answers in the final tuple.\n\nWe should add a base case to handle this recursive step as well - if there are no more sections in `remaining_text`, return an empty tuple (similarly to how we handled the '# Question' or '# Answer' patterns).\n\nIf we've processed all questions and answers, return the final tuple. If not, return `None, None`.\n\n\nAnswer: Here is the Python function that should solve this problem.\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    def get_question_answer(current_section, remaining_text):\n        if not remaining_text:\n            return ()\n\n        pattern = (\"# Question\", \"# Answer\")\n        start = len(pattern[0]) + 1 if pattern[0].startswith(\"# \") else 0\n        end = len(pattern[1]) + 1 if pattern[1].startswith(\"# \") else 0\n\n        question_answer_index = remaining_text.find(pattern[0][start:end])\n        if question_answer_index == -1:\n            return ()\n\n        section = []\n        section += get_question_answer(current_section, remaining_text[:question_answer_index])\n        question = (remaining_text[:question_answer_index - start].strip(),)\n        answer = remaining_text[question_answer_index - end:].strip()\n\n        return section + ((question,), (answer,) if answer else None)\n\n    nested_sections = (\"# Subquestion\", \"# Subanswer\")\n    sections = []\n\n    for section in md.split(\"\\n\"):\n        if any(subsection in section for subsection in nested_sections):\n            question_answers = get_question_answer([], section)\n            sections.extend(question_answers)\n\n    return tuple((q, a) for q, a in zip(*sections)) if sections else (None, None)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[133,1463],"elapsed":42.210579875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
