The researchers are using Markdown for their documentation and have created some markdown sections to ask questions about various symptoms and treatments. They want the AI assistant to extract all possible Questions and Answers from these sections.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the markdown text:\n\n```markdown\n# Question 1\nWhat is the average temperature of a healthy human?\n# Answer 1\nThe normal body temperature for humans ranges between 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C).\n\n## Question 2\nWhich type of diet reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases the most?\n# Answer 2\nA balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n```\n\nThe research team has provided you with this simplified version of their markdown text. Your task is to write a Python function `md_question_answer(md:String) -> Tuple[str, str]` that returns all questions and answers in separate lists where each item is a tuple containing the question or answer as a string and its index in the original markdown file.\n\nQuestion: How would you design this function to handle such complexities?\n\n\n\nFirst step involves breaking down the problem into smaller manageable sub-problems. As we have to extract questions and answers separately, we can utilize Python's re library which provides functionality for regular expressions.\n\nCreate a helper function `strip_text(md: String) -> List[str]` that removes leading and trailing spaces, newline characters from each line of the markdown text. This will help clean up the extracted questions and answers before we process them further.\n\nNext, we'll extract all lines starting with \"#\" which is a common indicator for marking off sections in Markdown. We use `re.findall()` function to do this. The pattern should match any line that begins with '#' followed by one or more spaces and then the rest of the line (including newline if it exists).\n\nTo extract questions, we need a pattern that matches lines starting with '# Question'. We use `re.findall()` again to do this. The pattern should match any line that begins with '# Question' followed by one or more spaces and then the rest of the line (including newline if it exists).\n\nTo extract answers, we need a pattern that matches lines starting with '# Answer'. We use `re.findall()` again to do this. The pattern should match any line that begins with '# Answer' followed by one or more spaces and then the rest of the line (including newline if it exists).\n\nWe will also have to handle cases where a question or answer spans multiple lines in our markdown text. For such scenarios, we can make use of Python's `re.sub()` function to replace each section with its index. This way, we are left with only the questions and answers and not their respective indices which would have been contained within those sections.\n\nFinally, we will construct a list comprehension that uses our helper function `strip_text(md: String) -> List[str]` along with the extracted questions and answers to build our final list of tuples containing the question or answer as a string and its index in the original markdown file.\n\nAnswer:\n```python\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\n\ndef strip_text(md: str) -> List[str]:\nreturn [line.strip() for line in md.split(\"\\n\")]\n\n\ndef md_question_answer(md: str) -> List[Tuple[str, int]]:\nlines = re.findall('# Question\\s+.*?$', md, flags=re.DOTALL)\nquestions = strip_text(md).index(lines)\n\nlines = re.findall('# Answer\\s+.*?$', md, flags=re.DOTALL)\nanswers = strip_text(md).index(lines)\n\nreturn [(question, questions[i]) for i, question in enumerate(questions)] + \\\n[(answer, answers[i]) for i, answer in enumerate(answers)]\n\n\n# Test the function with provided markdown text.\nmd = \"# Question 1\\n What is the average temperature of a healthy human?\\n # Answer 1\\n The normal body temperature for humans ranges between 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C).\\n\\n# Question 2\\n Which type of diet reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases the most?\\n # Answer 2\\n A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\"\nprint(md_question_answer(md)) \n```","status":200,"tokens":[96,1165],"elapsed":32.553168958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
