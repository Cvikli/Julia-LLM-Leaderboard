The source code of this function is shared with you by your colleague, but unfortunately, some parts were intentionally obfuscated using a simple encryption method:\n\n- Each line in the markdown text is replaced with a number based on the length of the line (1 for one character, 2 for two characters etc.). \n- The question and answer are separated by an odd number.\n\nThe encoded version of `md` looks like this: `[7, 1, 11, 3, 9, 1]`.\n\nYour task is to decrypt the markdown text and extract the questions and answers.\n\nQuestion: What will be your method to decode this markdown and extract the correct information?\n\n\nFirst, we need to understand how encryption works in our problem. Each line's length is replaced by a number indicating that many characters are present in the line. Therefore, we can deduce that the first number '7' indicates seven lines of text.\n\nNext, we have to consider the fact that odd numbers separate questions and answers. This means there must be an even number following after '1', indicating that there is one answer. We then add 2 to this value since 1 is already considered as a line in our first step. Therefore, the second number should be 3 (odd + 2 = odd), which indicates two lines of text.\n\nLet's test if these deduced numbers and their corresponding logic hold for our original markdown by reversing the process: For 7 characters, we get 7 lines. Adding 2 gives 9, which is the third line in our original markdown. So far so good.\n\nFor 3 characters (which corresponds to '1'), we have 1 line. Adding 2 gives us 3, which matches our fourth line in the encoded text.\n\nFinally, for 11 characters, we get 11 lines of text. Adding 2 gives 13, but since our original markdown only has 10 lines, there must be an error somewhere. We've assumed that each line is replaced by its length (which can sometimes exceed the number of actual lines), hence the difference between our calculated and expected numbers.\n\nAnswer: The problem with this encryption method is in assuming that every line's length corresponds to a count of how many lines are present, not the characters in those lines. We need to find another way to decrypt these marksdown texts. The final solution could be finding a more accurate pattern for encoding or developing a new decryption function that takes into account this incorrect assumption about counting lines based on line lengths.","status":200,"tokens":[133,704],"elapsed":18.981232542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
