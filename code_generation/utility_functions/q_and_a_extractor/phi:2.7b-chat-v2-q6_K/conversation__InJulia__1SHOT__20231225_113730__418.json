You have developed the `q_and_a_extractor` function to accomplish this task efficiently. However, you notice some peculiarities in the extracted data:\n\n1) The \"Question\" often refers to a hypothesis or an experimental design question, but sometimes it also includes a patient's medical history information that should be excluded as irrelevant for most users. \n2) The \"Answer\" always starts with \"Research findings:\" even if the research did not yield any significant findings, the answer text remains the same.\n3) There are some cases where both questions and answers contain references to statistical analyses or data visualizations (`# Question: ... # Answer: ...`). \n4) The function currently doesn't handle errors gracefully; for example, it won't return anything if a question is not found in the document.\n\nGiven these observations, can you modify `q_and_a_extractor` to correctly extract only valid questions and answers from the given markdown-formatted text?\n\n\nStart by identifying the key information in the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections of a medical journal article that should be considered as part of the Q&A pair. In this case, we are interested in questions about research design (hypothesis generation, data collection methods) and answers related to the findings or conclusions of the study.\n\nRefine your regular expressions to specifically capture these elements: `regexp(md,'# Question', 'match')` should be modified to include any text that starts with \"Research design:\" and ends with a period (i.e., `\"Research design:\" followed by some text ending in a newline or full stop). The same goes for the regular expression to capture the answer, which could look like `# Answer: ...`.\n\nHandle errors gracefully. A simple way is to modify the function so that it returns an empty list if no valid Q&A pair was found in the document. \n\nTest your updated function on different markdown-formatted medical journal articles and check if all extracted pairs are valid questions and answers. You can use a proof by exhaustion approach where you test each possible scenario with the given modifications to ensure they handle edge cases correctly.\n\nAnswer: An example of how this could be implemented in Julia is shown below:\n```\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = regexp(md,'# Question', 'match')\n    answers = regexp(md, '# Answer', 'match')\n    valid_qas = []\n    for q in questions:\n        for a in answers:\n            if (regexp(a,'Research design:\\s(.*?\\.|$)', 'match') && regexp(q,'# Question: \\1 # Answer: \\2', 'match'))\n                valid_qas.append((q, a))\n    return valid_qas if !isempty(valid_qas) else []\nend\n```\nThis version of `q_and_a_extractor` should correctly extract only the questions and answers from medical journal articles that are relevant for your AI assistant. It handles edge cases gracefully, including situations where no valid Q&A pair was found in the document.","status":200,"tokens":[96,913],"elapsed":24.680245083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
