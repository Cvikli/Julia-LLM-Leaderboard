[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Let's get started on solving the task at hand using our systematic approach to problem-solving in Julia.\n\nRecall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\n* Functions and closures\n* Control structures (if-elseif-else, for, while)\n* Anonymous functions and lambda expressions\n* Array slicing and indexing\n* Dictionary operations ($)\n\nSolve the Task:\n\nWe can solve this task by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems. Here's one possible approach:\n\n1. Check if there are any `# Question` or `# Answer` directives in the input `md` text. If there are none, return an empty tuple.\n2. Otherwise, iterate through the markdown sections using a loop (e.g., `for line in md`).\n3. For each line in the markdown section, check if it starts with `# Question`. If it does, extract the question text by substring extraction (`sub`) and return it in a tuple with the answer text from the next line (`next`).\n4. Otherwise, check if the line starts with `# Answer`. If it does, extract the answer text using the same approach as step 3.\n5. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text before returning the answer in the tuple.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Julia:\n```julia\n# Check if there are any # Question or # Answer directives in the input markdown text\nhas_question = false\nhas_answer = false\nfor line in md\n    if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n        has_question = true\n    elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n        has_answer = true\n    end\nend\n\n# Extract question and answer text\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    if has_question && has_answer\n        question = sub(\"^('# Question|# Answer).*\", \"\", md)\n        answer = next(md)\n        return (question, answer)\n    else\n        return () # empty tuple\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nq_and_a_extractor(\"This is a markdown text with # Question and # Answer directives.\")\n```\nDouble-check that the solution is correct:\n\nWe can double-check our solution by testing it on a few sample inputs. For example, we can test the `q_and_a_extractor` function with the following inputs:\n\n* A markdown text with only `# Question` directives: The function should return an empty tuple.\n* A markdown text with only `# Answer` directives: The function should return a tuple with the answer text.\n* A markdown text with both `# Question` and `# Answer` directives: The function should return a tuple with both the question and answer texts.\n\nBy verifying our solution in this way, we can ensure that it works correctly for all possible inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[399,648],"elapsed":27.952271958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
