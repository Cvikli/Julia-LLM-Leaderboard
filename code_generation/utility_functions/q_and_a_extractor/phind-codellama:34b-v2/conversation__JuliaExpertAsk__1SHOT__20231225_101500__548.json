It splits this text into individual lines and then iterates over each line. \n\nIf a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets the flag `in_question` to true and skips to the next line. If a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and `in_question` to false, and again skips to the next line. \n\nIf `in_question` is true, we append the current line (after stripping leading spaces and newlines) to the variable `question`. If `in_answer` is true, we do the same for the variable `answer`.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the first \"# Question\" comes before the first \"# Answer\".","status":200,"tokens":[149,377],"elapsed":49.683721625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
