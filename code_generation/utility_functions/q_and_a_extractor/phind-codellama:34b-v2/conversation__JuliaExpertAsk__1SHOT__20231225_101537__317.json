It keeps track of whether it's currently inside a question or an answer section, and appends each line to either `question` or `answer`, depending on which section it's in. At the end, it returns a tuple of rstrip(question) and rstrip(answer), which removes trailing spaces from them.","status":200,"tokens":[149,269],"elapsed":36.189756625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
