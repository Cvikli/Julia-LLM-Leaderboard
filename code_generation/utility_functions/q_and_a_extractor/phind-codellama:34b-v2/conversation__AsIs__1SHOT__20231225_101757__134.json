Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python solution that uses regular expressions to extract the question and answer sections from the markdown text. It uses the `re` library for regex operations and `itertools.groupby` to group the lines in the markdown into groups starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom itertools import groupby\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    # Split md into lines\n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    \n    # Create a stream of (is_question, text) pairs\n    question_answer_pairs = []\n    for k, g in groupby(lines, lambda x: re.search(r'^#\\s*(Question|Answer)', x)):\n        if k is not None:\n            # Extract the actual question or answer text without leading '# ', spaces and newlines\n            text = ''.join(line[2:] for line in g).strip()\n            \n            # Check if it's a question or an answer\n            if re.search('Question', k):\n                current_question = text\n            else:\n                question_answer_pairs.append((current_question, text))\n    \n    return question_answer_pairs\n```\n\nThis function works by first splitting the markdown input into lines. It then creates a stream of `(is_question, text)` pairs using `groupby`. The key for each group is determined by whether there's a `# Question` or `# Answer` at the start of a line, and the group itself consists of all following lines that don't match this pattern (until the next question or answer).\n\nThe actual extraction of the text is done using list comprehension: it strips each line in the group of its leading '# ', any spaces and newlines. If the current line is a `# Question`, it is stored as `current_question`. Otherwise, it's considered as `# Answer` and appended to the output stream with the preceding question.","status":200,"tokens":[107,436],"elapsed":56.26041475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
