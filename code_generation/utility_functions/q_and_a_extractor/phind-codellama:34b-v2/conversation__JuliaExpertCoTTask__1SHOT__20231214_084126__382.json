When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's my solution to the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Parse markdown text\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Extract Question and Answer sections\n    question, answer = find_sections(doc, \"Question\", \"Answer\")\n\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from extracted text\n    strip_spaces(question), strip_spaces(answer)\nend\n\n# Helper function to find sections in markdown text\nfunction find_sections(text, start_string, end_string)\n    # Use regular expressions to find sections\n    section_pattern = Regex.compile(start_string + \"[^]*)(${end_string})\")\n    matches = section_pattern.match(text)\n\n    # Return tuple of question and answer text\n    (question, answer) = matches[1:2]\nend\n\n# Helper function to strip leading spaces and newlines from text\nfunction strip_spaces(text)\n    # Use String.replace to remove leading spaces and newlines\n    text = String.replace(text, \" \"^ 1)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function takes a markdown-formatted string as input and returns a tuple of the extracted question and answer text, stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\nThe function uses the `Markdown.parse()` function to parse the markdown text into a parse tree, and then iterates over the nodes in the tree to find the \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections using the `find_sections()` function. The `find_sections()` function uses regular expressions to find the sections based on the start and end strings specified.\n\nOnce the question and answer sections are found, the `strip_spaces()` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the text. Finally, the extracted question and answer text is returned in a tuple.\n\nNote: In the example input provided, the `# Question` and `# Answer` lines are included as comment lines, so they are not considered as part of the markdown text to be parsed. If you want to include them, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[229,492],"elapsed":18.899108208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
