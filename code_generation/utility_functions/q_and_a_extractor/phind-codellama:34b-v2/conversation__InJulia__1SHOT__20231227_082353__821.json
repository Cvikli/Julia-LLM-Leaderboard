[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution in Julia. It uses the `eachmatch` function to iterate over all matches of a pattern in a string, and the `strip` function to remove leading spaces and newlines.\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = eachmatch(r\"^# Question\\n*(.*?)(\\n*^#|\\z)\", md, \"s\")  # 's' means dot (.) also matches newline\n    answers = eachmatch(r\"^# Answer\\n*(.*?)(\\n*^#|\\z)\", md, \"s\")\n\n    q_and_a = Vector{Tuple{String, String}}()\n    \n    for (q, a) in zip(questions, answers)\n        push!(q_and_a, (strip(q.captures[1]), strip(a.captures[1])))\n    end\n    \n    return q_and_a\nend\n```\nThis function works by finding matches of the regular expressions `r\"^# Question\\n*(.*?)(\\n*^#|\\z)\"` and `r\"^# Answer\\n*(.*?)(\\n*^#|\\z)\"` in the input string `md`. These regular expressions match text starting with `# Question`, `# Answer` until the next `#` or end of the string. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the matched text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are always corresponding pairs of `# Question` and `# Answer` in your markdown text, and they come in correct order. If the input format can be arbitrary, then more sophisticated parsing strategy is needed.","status":200,"tokens":[110,379],"elapsed":49.696487041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
