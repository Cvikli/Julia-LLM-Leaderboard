The `|` operator is used to handle cases where the answer header is not preceded by a question header. The matched strings are stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` function.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that your input Markdown follows a specific structure: `# Question`, then the text of the question, followed by `# Answer` and the text of the answer. It may not work correctly if the input doesn't follow this exact structure.","status":200,"tokens":[110,372],"elapsed":48.22582725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
