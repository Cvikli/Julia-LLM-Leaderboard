[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing RegularExpressions\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = eachmatch(r\"(?<=# Question\\n).*?(?=\\n# Answer|$)\", md)\n    answers = eachmatch(r\"(?<=# Answer\\n).*?(?=\\n# Question|$)\", md)\n    \n    q_and_a = map(m -> strip(m.match), zip(questions, answers))\n    return Tuple(q_and_a)\nend\n```\n\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function uses regular expressions to match text between `# Question` and `# Answer` or end of the string. It uses lookbehind and lookahead assertions to capture only the relevant content in a non-greedy manner. The matched questions and answers are zipped together, `strip` is applied to remove leading spaces and newlines, and the result is converted into a tuple.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is Julia?\n\n# Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments like MATLAB and Python.
