[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use regular expressions to achieve this. Here is a Python function that does it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.search(r'# Question\\s*?(.*?)(\\n#|$)', md, flags=re.DOTALL)\n    answer = re.search(r'# Answer\\s*?(.*?)(\\n#|$)', md, flags=re.DOTALL)\n    \n    if question and answer:\n        return (question.group(1).strip(), answer.group(1).strip())\n    else:\n        return None\n```\nThis function uses the regular expression `# Question\\s*?(.*?)(\\n#|$)` to match the text following `# Question` up to either another `#` or the end of the string. It does this in non-greedy mode so it stops at the first occurrence, rather than going all the way to the last occurrence. The `strip()` function is then used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the matched text.\n\nThe same process is repeated for the answer, but with `# Answer` instead of `# Question`.\n\nIf both a question and an answer are found, they are returned as a tuple `(question,answer)`. If either a question or an answer is not found, `None` is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[107,297],"elapsed":38.852339125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
