[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for your task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    in_question, in_answer = false, false\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question && !isempty(line)\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer && !isempty(line)\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (rstrip(question), rstrip(answer)) # Remove trailing spaces and return the result.\nend\n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown text into lines, then iterates over each line. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it sets `in_question` to true and skips to the next line. Similarly, when it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it sets `in_answer` to true and skips to the next line.\n\nIf `in_question` is true and the current line is not empty, it appends the stripped line to `question`. If `in_answer` is true and the current line is not empty, it appends the stripped line to `answer`. Finally, it returns a tuple of the rstrip-ed question and answer.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhy is Julia fast?\n# Answer\nJulia is fast because it is a statically typed, compiled language that uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for efficient execution of code. It also provides a package manager for easily including third-party libraries and allows for easy interfacing with Python and C.\n\"\"\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # Output: (\"Why is Julia fast?\", \"Julia is fast because it is a statically typed, compiled language that uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for efficient execution of code.
