The function first splits the markdown text into lines using double newlines as a delimiter. It then filters out only the lines that start with \"Question:\". For each remaining line, it parses the question and answer using regular expressions and stores them in a tuple. Finally, the function applies string stripping to both elements of each tuple and returns an array of tuples.","status":200,"tokens":[139,280],"elapsed":9.273228,"_type":"aimessage"}]
