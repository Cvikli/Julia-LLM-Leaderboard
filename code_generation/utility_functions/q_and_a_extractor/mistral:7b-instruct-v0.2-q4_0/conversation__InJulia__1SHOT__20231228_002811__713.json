It stores their indices in arrays `questions` and `answers`, respectively. Then it extracts the question and answer texts by taking appropriate slices of the lines array. Finally, it returns a tuple containing two arrays: one for the questions and another for the answers, with any leading spaces and newlines stripped off.","status":200,"tokens":[98,400],"elapsed":12.853515166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
