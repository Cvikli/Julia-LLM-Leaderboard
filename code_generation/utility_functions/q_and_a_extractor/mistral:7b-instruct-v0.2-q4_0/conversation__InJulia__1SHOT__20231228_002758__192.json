Here's an implementation for this:\n\n```julia using Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regex patterns for Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s+(.+)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s+(.+)\"\n\n    # Split markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize empty list to store questions and answers\n    qa_pairs = []\n\n    # Iterate through each line in the markdown text\n    for line in lines\n        # Use regex pattern to extract Question sections\n        match = match(question_pattern, line)\n        if isnothing(match)\n            continue\n        end\n\n        question = String(match.captures[1])\n        question = strip(question)\n\n        # Store the extracted question in the list\n        push!(qa_pairs, (question, \"\"))\n\n        # Use regex pattern to extract Answer sections\n        for next_line in lines[(findfirst(x -> startswith(x, \"#\"), 1:length(lines))+1):end]\n            match = match(answer_pattern, next_line)\n            if isnothing(match) || !isempty(qa_pairs[length(qa_pairs)].answer)\n                continue\n            end\n\n            answer = String(match.captures[1])\n            answer = strip(answer)\n\n            # Store the extracted answer for the corresponding question in the list\n            last_q_a = qa_pairs[length(qa_pairs)-1]\n            last_q_a.answer = answer\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return a tuple containing all extracted questions and answers\n    return qa_pairs\nend\n```\n\nThis function accepts markdown text as its argument, extracts the Question and Answer sections using regex patterns, and returns a tuple of question-answer pairs. It strips leading spaces and newlines from both the questions and answers during extraction.","status":200,"tokens":[98,515],"elapsed":16.464154209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
