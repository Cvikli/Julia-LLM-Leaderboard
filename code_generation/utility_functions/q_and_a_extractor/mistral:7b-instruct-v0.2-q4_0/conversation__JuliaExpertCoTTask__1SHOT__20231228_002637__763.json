Then it iterates through these lines and identifies the indices of each question and answer line based on their unique prefixes (`# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively). For each identified question and answer, it extracts the text content and stores it in separate arrays. Finally, it checks if there is a one-to-one correspondence between questions and answers before returning a tuple of question texts and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[240,681],"elapsed":22.841509959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
