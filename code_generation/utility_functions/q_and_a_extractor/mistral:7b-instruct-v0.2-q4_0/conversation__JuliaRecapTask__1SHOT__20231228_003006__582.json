[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

We define the `q_and_a_extractor` function taking an `AbstractString` as its argument, which represents the markdown text.\n2. We split the input markdown text into lines using the `split` function with a newline character as the delimiter.\n3. We create an empty list called `questions_and_answers` to store our extracted question-answer pairs.\n4. We iterate through each line in the markdown text, checking if it starts with \"Question:\" or \"Q:\". If it does, we extract the question and answer using their respective indices (calculated using `findfirst`) and store them as a tuple inside the list. We also break out of the loop once we've found a question and its corresponding answer to avoid processing duplicates.\n5. Finally, we return the `questions_and_answers` list containing all extracted question-answer pairs.","status":200,"tokens":[404,554],"elapsed":19.794409291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
