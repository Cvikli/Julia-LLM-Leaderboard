X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - String manipulation functions like `rpad`, `ltrim`, and `chop` from Base.\n   - Regular expressions for pattern matching in strings.\n   - Functions for processing markdown files or strings, if necessary.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\nFirst, let's define our function `q_and_a_extractor`. The input will be a Markdown string `md`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    answers = []\n    questions = []\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = chop(ltrim(line[7:end]))\n            questions = pushfirst(questions, question)\n\n            nextline = lines[findnext(x -> isnothing(x), lines) + 1]\n            answer = ltrim(rpad(chop(nextline), length(question)))\n            answers = push!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n- We initialize two empty arrays, `questions` and `answers`.\n- We split the input markdown string into lines using the `split` function.\n- We iterate through each line in the resulting array, checking if it starts with \"# Question\". If so, we extract the question text (the next line is assumed to be the answer).\n- We add both questions and answers to their respective arrays.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nWe can test our function with some input markdown strings to ensure it works as expected. Here's a simple test script for it:\n\n```julia\nusing Test\n\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nQuestion text 1\n\nAnswer text 1\n\n# Question 2\nQuestion text 2\n\nAnswer text 2\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n@test length(questions_answers[1]) == 2\n@test length(questions_answers[2]) == 2\n\nfor i in 1:2\n    @test questions_answers[1][i] != \"\"\n    @test questions_answers[2][i] != \"\"\nend\n```\n\nThis test script initializes a markdown string containing two question-answer pairs, then calls our `q_and_a_extractor` function and checks that the output is what we expect.","status":200,"tokens":[404,634],"elapsed":22.480573875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
