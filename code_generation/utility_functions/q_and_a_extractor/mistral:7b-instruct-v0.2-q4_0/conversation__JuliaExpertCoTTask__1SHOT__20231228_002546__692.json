Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    current_section = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            push!(questions, popfirst(lines))\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") && !isempty(answers)\n            push!(answers, popfirst(lines))\n            current_section = \"\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    question, answer = map(strip, questions, answers)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\nfunction startswith(line::AbstractString, pattern::AbstractString)\n    line[1:length(pattern)] == pattern\nend\n\nfunction strip(str::AbstractString)\n    replace(replace(str, r\"^[\\s\\r\\n]*\", \"\"), r\"\\s+$\" => \"\")\nend\n\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer:  $answer\")\n```\n\nThis code first defines a helper function `q_and_a_extractor`, which takes markdown-formatted text as an argument. The function splits the given markdown text into lines and creates two empty arrays, `questions` and `answers`. It also sets the current section to be either \"question\" or nothing.\n\nThe for loop iterates through each line in the markdown text. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it saves the previous lines as a question and sets the current section to be \"question\". Similarly, when it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\" but has an answer already, it saves that line as an answer and clears the current section.\n\nAfter processing all lines in the markdown text, the function strips leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer strings using the helper `strip` function, then returns the extracted question-answer pair as a tuple.\n\nThe main code block defines some test data for the `q_and_a_extractor` function, which is run to print out the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[240,530],"elapsed":17.836229958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
