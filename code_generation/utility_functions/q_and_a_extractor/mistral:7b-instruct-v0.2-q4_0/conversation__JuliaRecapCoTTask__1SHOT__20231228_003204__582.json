[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the provided task and special instructions, here is how I would approach this problem using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- Regular expressions for pattern matching in strings\n- String manipulation functions like `strip` and `rstrip`\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define regular expressions for Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s+(.+)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s+(.+)\"\n\n    # Initialize empty list to store extracted questions and answers\n    qas = []\n\n    # Use regex to find all occurrences of Question and Answer sections in md\n    matches = eachmatch(r\"($question_pattern|$answer_pattern)\", md)\n\n    # Process each match and extract the question and answer text\n    for match in matches\n        if occursin(\"Question\", match.match)\n            question = match.captures[1] |> strip |> trim\n            push!(qas, (question, \"\"))\n        else\n            answer = match.captures[1] |> strip |> trim\n            last_qa = last(qas)\n            last_qa[2] = answer\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return a tuple of all extracted questions and answers\n    return qas\nend\n```\n\n2. Solve the Task:\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown-formatted text as an argument, uses regular expressions to identify Question and Answer sections, extracts their text while stripping leading spaces and newlines, and stores them in a list of tuples, each containing a question and its corresponding answer.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nThis function should correctly extract all text from the markdown sections labeled as \"Question\" and \"Answer\", respectively, without considering any additional formatting or metadata within those sections. Test cases for various edge cases should be written to ensure its robustness.","status":200,"tokens":[406,465],"elapsed":16.788996666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
