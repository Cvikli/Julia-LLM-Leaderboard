Think through my approach step by step:\n   - Parse the given markdown text `md` using a Markdown parser library to convert it into a tree-like structure.\n   - Traverse the parsed tree to extract the Question and Answer sections.\n   - Return a tuple containing the extracted question and answer, with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n  parsed = mdparse(md)\n  question :: AxisNode{1} = nothing\n  answer :: Union{AbstractString,Nothing} = nothing\n\n  for node in reverse(traverse(parsed))\n    if isa(node, Heading) && headinglevel(node) == 1 && occursin(\"Question\", node.content)\n      question = node\n      break\n    end\n  end\n\n  for node in traverse(parsed)\n    if isa(node, Paragraph) && startswith(node.content, \"# Answer\")\n      answer = node.content[length(\"## Answer\"):end]\n      break\n    end\n  end\n\n  (question.content[occursin(question.content, \"\\n\")+1:end], answer)\nend\n```\n\n3.
