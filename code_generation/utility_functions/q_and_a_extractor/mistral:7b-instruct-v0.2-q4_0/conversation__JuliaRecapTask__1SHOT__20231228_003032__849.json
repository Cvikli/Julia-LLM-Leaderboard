[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the special instructions provided, here's how I would approach this task using Julia:\n\nFirst, let's recall some useful Julia snippets for this task:\n1. Regular expressions for extracting substrings from strings\n2. Array manipulation functions for slicing and filtering\n3. Control structures like `if` and `else` for conditionally handling lines\n4. Functions to parse markdown headers\n\nNow, let's write the function `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions_and_answers = []\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question:\") || startswith(line, \"# Answer:\")\n            index = findfirst(x -> startswith(x, \"# Question:\"), lines) - 1\n            question = join(lines[index+1:findfirst(x -> !startswith(x, \"# \"), lines)-1), \"\\n\").strip()\n            answer = join(lines[findfirst(x -> startswith(x, \"# Answer:\"))+1:end], \"\\n\").strip()\n            push!(questions_and_answers, (question, answer))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return questions_and_answers\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the markdown text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`. Then, it iterates through each line to find lines that start with \"Question:\" or \"Answer:\". When it finds a Question line, it extracts all the subsequent lines until it encounters an Answer line by finding the index of the next line starting with \"# Answer:\". It then stores the question and answer as a tuple in an array called `questions_and_answers`. Finally, the function returns this array.\n\nLet's double-check the solution to make sure it works correctly:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\\\n# Question: What is Julia?\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\n\n# Answer:\nJulia is an open-source programming language that is designed to make complex computational science and engineering tasks easier and more efficient to perform.
