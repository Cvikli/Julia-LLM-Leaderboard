[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here is a systematic approach for this task:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - String manipulation with `rstrip()`, `lstrip()`, `match()`, and regular expressions\n   - Working with markdown content using the `Markdown` package, if necessary\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\nFirst, let's write a simple function without relying on any external packages, assuming that the given text is already parsed Markdown.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question:\")\n            push!(questions, popfirst(lines))\n            while !endswith(lines[1], \"## Answer:\\n\") && length(lines) > 1\n                popfirst!(lines)\n            end\n            if length(lines) < 2\n                error(\"Invalid markdown format.\")\n            end\n            push!(answers, popfirst(lines))\n        end\n    end\n\n    question, answer = map(x -> strip(x), questions)\n    question = match(r\"# Question:(.*)\", question)[1]\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` extracts all text in markdown sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\" by iterating through lines of given markdown text, keeping track of questions and answers in separate arrays, then returning a tuple containing question and answer strings after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nIf the given text is already parsed Markdown, this function should work correctly. If necessary, add error handling for missing components (\"Question\" or \"Answer\") or non-conformant markdown formats in the future.\n\nIn case the text is not yet parsed Markdown, consider using an external package like `Markdown` to handle parsing and make the function more generic.","status":200,"tokens":[406,512],"elapsed":18.397389791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
