[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the special instructions provided, here's the approach to implement the function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia:\n\n1. Use a regular expression to identify the Question and Answer sections in the given markdown text `md`.\n2. Extract the question and answer text from each identified section.\n3. Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using string manipulation functions.\n4. Return a tuple containing the question and answer text.\n\nFirst, recall some useful Julia snippets:\n- Regular expressions with the `r\"...\"` syntax for defining patterns.\n- String manipulation functions such as `strip` and `split`.\n\nNow, implement the function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    regex = r\"#\\s+(Question|Answer)\\n(?:.*?)(?=#\\s+(?:Question|Answer)|$)\"\n\n    matches = matchall(regex, md)\n    questions_answers = Dict()\n\n    for match in matches\n        question_or_answer, content = split(match.match, \"\\n\", keepempty=false)\n        (question, answer) = split(content, \": \", 2)\n        questions_answers[question] = strip(answer)\n    end\n\n    return tuple([keys(questions_answers)...], [values(questions_answers)...])\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a regular expression to find Question and Answer sections, then extracts and processes their text accordingly. It returns a tuple containing arrays of question and answer strings with leading spaces and newlines removed.","status":200,"tokens":[404,381],"elapsed":14.023184916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
