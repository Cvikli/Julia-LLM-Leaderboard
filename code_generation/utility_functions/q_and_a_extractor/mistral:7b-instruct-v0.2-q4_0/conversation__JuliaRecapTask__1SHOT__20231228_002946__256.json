X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions (for parsing markdown headers)\n   - String manipulation functions (for stripping leading spaces and newlines)\n   - Functions for processing markdown text\n   \n2. Solve the Task:\n\nFirst, let's define a helper function `parse_question_or_answer` that will extract the question or answer from a given line of markdown text based on whether it starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\":\n\n```julia\nfunction parse_question_or_answer(line)\n    m = match(r\"^#(?: Question| Answer)(.+)$\", line)\n    if isnothing(m)\n        return (nothing, nothing)\n    end\n    question_or_answer, text = split(m.match, \"\\n\")\n    trimmed_text = strip(text)\n    return (trimmed_text, nothing) if startswith(question_or_answer, \"Question\")\n    (nothing, trimmed_text)\nend\n```\n\nNow we can define the main `q_and_a_extractor` function that processes a given markdown text and returns a tuple of all questions and answers:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions_answers = Dict()\n    for line in lines\n        question, answer = parse_question_or_answer(line)\n        if !isnothing(question)\n            push!(questions_answers, (question, answer))\n        end\n    end\n    return values(questions_answers)\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nWe can test our `q_and_a_extractor` function by providing it with some markdown text and checking if the extracted questions and answers match the expected output. For example, given the following markdown text:\n\n```markdown\n# Question: What is Julia?\nJulia is a high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\n\n# Answer: How to install Julia?\nTo install Julia on your system, follow these steps:\n1.

Open Julia's interactive console by searching for \"Julia\" in your Start menu or Applications folder.\n```\n\nOur `q_and_a_extractor` function should correctly extract the following questions and answers:\n\n```julia\njulia> md = \"\"\"# Question: What is Julia?\n              Julia is a high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\n\n              # Answer: How to install Julia?\n              To install Julia on your system, follow these steps:\n                1.
