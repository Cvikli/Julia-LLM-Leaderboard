[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here's the systematic approach:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets:\n   - Reading lines from a string using `split`, `rstrip`, and `chomp`.\n   - Creating an empty dictionary `Dict()` for storing questions and answers.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions = Dict()\n    answers = Dict()\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_index = findnext(endswith, line, ':')[1] + 1\n            question = rstrip(line[question_index+1:findnext(r\"^\\$\", line)-1])\n            questions[question] = \"\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer_index = findnext(endswith, line, ':')[1] + 1\n            answer = rstrip(line[answer_index+1:end])\n            answers[question] = answer\n        end\n    end\n\n    tuples = []\n    for (q, a) in pairs(answers)\n        push!(tuples, (q, a))\n    end\n\n    return tuples\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - The function `q_and_a_extractor` takes an abstract string as input and returns a tuple of all extracted question-answer pairs from the markdown text.\n   - It initializes empty dictionaries for questions and answers.\n   - Then it iterates through each line in the markdown text and checks whether the line starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\".\n   - If it's a question, it extracts the question text using the `rstrip` function and stores it in the `questions` dictionary with an empty value.\n   - If it's an answer, it extracts the answer text using the `rstrip` function and stores it in the corresponding question from the `answers` dictionary.\n   - Finally, it creates a tuple of all extracted question-answer pairs and returns that tuple as output.","status":200,"tokens":[406,547],"elapsed":19.550470292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
