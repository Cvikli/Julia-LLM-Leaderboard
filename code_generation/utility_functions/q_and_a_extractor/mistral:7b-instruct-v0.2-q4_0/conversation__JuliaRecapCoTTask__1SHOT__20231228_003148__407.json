X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Regular expressions (for parsing markdown)\n   - String manipulation functions (for stripping leading spaces and newlines)\n   - Function definition and anonymous functions\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    r\"#\\s+Question(?:\\r|\\n)([^\\r\\n]+)\" = question_regex\n    r\"#\\s+Answer(?:\\r|\\n)([^\\r\\n]+)\" = answer_regex\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions_answers = Dict()\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if isnothing(match(question_regex, line)) && isnothing(match(answer_regex, line))\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        qa = match(line, question_regex) isa Match ? match(line, question_regex) : nothing\n        q = qa isa Nothing ? nothing : strip(qa.captures[1])\n        \n        a = line[(findnext(x -> x == '# Answer', lines) - 1):]\n        answer = strip(split(a, \"\\n\")[1])\n        \n        isnothing(q) && continue\n        push!(questions_answers, (strip(q), strip(answer)))\n    end\n    \n    return questions_answers\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown string as an argument and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer. The function uses regular expressions to find occurrences of \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections in the markdown text. It then strips leading spaces, newlines, and empty lines from the questions and answers before storing them as tuples in a dictionary.\n\nTo test this function, you can write some unit tests:\n\n```julia\n@testset \"q_and_a_extractor\" begin\n    md = \"\"\"\n    # Question 1\n    This is question one.\n    \n    # Answer 1\n    This is the answer to question one.\n    \n    # Question 2\n    What's the capital of France?\n    \n    # Answer 2\n    Paris\n\n    # Question 3\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    expected = [(\"This is question one.\", \"This is the answer to question one.\"), (\"What's the capital of France?\", \"Paris\")]\n    @test q_and_a_extractor(md) == expected\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[406,644],"elapsed":22.829578417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
