[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we will follow these steps:\n1. Read the markdown text `md`.\n2. Split the text into lines using the `split` function.\n3. Iterate through the lines and extract the Question and Answer sections by checking for lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n4. Extract the text between these headers and the next header or end of file using a loop.\n5. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n6. Return the question and answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.\n\nHere's the Julia code to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, r'\\n')\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    \n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if starts_with(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n        elseif starts_with(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n        elseif in_question && !starts_with(line, \"#\")\n            push!(questions, strip(line))\n            in_question = false\n        elseif in_answer && !starts_with(line, \"#\")\n            push!(answers, strip(line))\n            in_answer = false\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (questions[1], join(answers, \"\\n\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function should work for markdown texts with multiple questions and answers. If there is only one question or answer, the returned tuple will still have two elements, but the appropriate element will be an empty string.","status":200,"tokens":[413,390],"elapsed":17.711805708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
