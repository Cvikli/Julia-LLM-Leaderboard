X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here's a Julia function that accomplishes this:\n```julia\nusing Match\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    pattern = r\"# (Question|Answer)\\n(.*)\\n\"\n    matches = eachmatch(pattern, md)\n    \n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    \n    for match in matches\n        question_match = match[:question]\n        answer_match = match[:answer]\n        \n        if !isempty(question_match)\n            push!(questions, trim(question_match))\n        end\n        \n        if !isempty(answer_match)\n            push!(answers, trim(answer_match))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (questions, answers)\nend\n```\nThis function first defines a regular expression pattern that matches the question and answer headings. Then it iterates through all the matches in the input `md` string. If there's a match for a question or an answer, it appends the trimmed text to the corresponding array. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the questions and answers arrays.\n\nTo use this function, pass your markdown-formatted text as an argument:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\n\n(questions, answers) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", questions[1])\nprintln(\"Answer:   \", answers[1])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[413,382],"elapsed":17.464466916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
