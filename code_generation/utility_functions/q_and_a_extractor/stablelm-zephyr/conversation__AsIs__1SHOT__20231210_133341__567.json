Answer: My favorite food is pizza.\n```\nExplanation of the code:\n\n* The `q_and_a_extractor` function takes a Markdown document as input and loops through each line.\n* If the line starts with `# Question`, it extracts the question text by substring-ing the line starting from the fifth character (`#`) and stripping any leading spaces or newlines.\n* Similarly, if the line starts with `# Answer`, it extracts the answer text by substring-ing the line starting from the fifth character (`#`) and stripping any leading spaces or newlines.\n* Otherwise, the function ignores the line.\n* The `q_and_a` variable is initialized with the extracted question and answer text as a NamedTuple.\n* The `QuestionAndAnswer` class defines the structure of the Question and Answer pair, with the `question` and `answer` attributes.\n* In the example document, the function extracts the question \"What is your favorite food?\" and the answer \"My favorite food is pizza.\" and returns them as a NamedTuple.","status":200,"tokens":[110,606],"elapsed":21.659551958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
