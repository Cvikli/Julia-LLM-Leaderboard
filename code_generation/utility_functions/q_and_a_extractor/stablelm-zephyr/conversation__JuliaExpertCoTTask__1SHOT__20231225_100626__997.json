Task: Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n2. Data: `md` (a markdown-formatted text).\n3. Create a function named `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a single argument `md`, which should be a string containing the markdown text.\n4. Initialize an empty dictionary called `stack` to store the opening and closing markers for Question, Answer, and their respective IDs. For simplicity, we'll consider the first line as either a header or a task description (Question/Answer), so the \"header\" ID will be 0, \"question\" 1, and \"answer\" 2.\n5. Iterate through each line in `md`. If the current line is a newline (`\\n`) or starting with '#' (heading), check for Question and Answer markers, handle them if found, and update our stack accordingly. If it's not a heading, add the text to the result list.\n6. After iterating through all lines in `md`, create a final list of tuples from the result containing pairs of \"question\" and \"answer\" values separated by spaces. Return this list as the output of the function.\n7. Let's write the code now:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n# Initialize stack\nstack = [0, 1, 2]\n\n# Split md into lines\nlines = split(String(1, md), \"\\n\")\n\n# Process each line\nfor i, line in enumerate(lines)\nif (i == 0 || I == len(lines) - 1) && line[1:].startswith(\"# \")\nif stack[-1] == 0\nstack[-1] = Int(substr(line, 2))\nelseif stack[-2] == 1\npush!(stack, 2)\nelseif stack[-3] == 2\npush!(stack, 3)\nelseif line[1:].startswith(\"# Question\")\nresult.push((line(1:end), lines[stack[-1] - 1]))\nelseif line[1:].startswith(\"# Answer\")\nresult.push((lines[stack[-1] + 2], lines[stack[-2] + 4]))\nelse\n# If not a heading, add the text to result list\nif I == 0 || (I > 1 && start(lines, i - 2) != \"## \")\nresult.push(line)\nend\nend\n\n# Create final list of tuples from result containing pairs of Q&A values separated by spaces\nreturn iter(result, [(_, _)])\nend\n```\nThis function should correctly extract the Question and Answer sections in the given markdown data.","status":200,"tokens":[241,686],"elapsed":13.484963875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
