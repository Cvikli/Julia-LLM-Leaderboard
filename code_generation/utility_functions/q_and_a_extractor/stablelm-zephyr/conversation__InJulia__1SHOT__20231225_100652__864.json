The part inside `(?:...)` captures the content of the line between `# Question` and `# Answer`, if present.\n\nThe `PatternMatch.split()` function splits the first captured group (i.e., the content between `# Question` and `# Answer`) into a question and an answer, trimming leading spaces to match your requirements. If no matches are found, it throws an error.","status":200,"tokens":[108,281],"elapsed":5.05451175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
