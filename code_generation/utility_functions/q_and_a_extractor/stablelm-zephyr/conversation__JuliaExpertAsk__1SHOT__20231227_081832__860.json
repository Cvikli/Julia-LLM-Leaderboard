Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\nHere's a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function using the `rmarkdown` package to parse the markdown text and the `re` module in Python for regular expression matching:\n```python\nimport re\nimport rmarkdown\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n# Define a regex pattern to match question and answer sections\npattern = (r\"(?<=^|\\n)\\s*# Question\\s*(.*?)\" + \nr\"\\s*# Answer\\s*(.*?)\" + r\"\\s*\"\n)\n\nmatches = []\nfor chunk in md.readable():\nif chunk:\nchunk_text = re.sub(pattern, r'\\1 \\2', chunk)\nmatches.append((rtrim(chunk_text[0]), rtrim(chunk_text[1])))\n\nreturn matches\n```\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function takes a `RmarkdownDocument` object as input and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the stripped question and answer text for each matching section. The main idea behind this implementation is to use two regular expressions (`pattern`) to capture the text between the `# Question` and `# Answer` markers while ignoring any leading or trailing whitespace:\n\n1. The first regex pattern `(?<=^|\\n)\\s*# Question\\s*(.*?)` matches a line that starts with either a newline character (`\\n`) or a line containing only whitespace (leading spaces are captured inside the `?`, while the text between `# Question` and `# Answer` is captured in parentheses as well).\n2. The second regex pattern `\\s*# Answer\\s*(.*?)` matches another line that starts with either a newline character or some whitespace, then captures the text between `# Answer` and the end of the file (`^`, which means any remaining content will be discarded).\nThe function uses an iterative approach to extract question and answer sections by iterating over each chunk in the markdown document: If a chunk is not empty, it applies the regular expressions to remove leading/trailing whitespace and then appends the extracted question and answer text as a tuple. Finally, it returns the list of all matches found in the input markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[145,502],"elapsed":9.346757708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
