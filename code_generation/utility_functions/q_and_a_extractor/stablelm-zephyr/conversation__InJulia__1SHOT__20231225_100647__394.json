[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should do the trick:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n# Find all lines starting with #Question and #Answer\nquestions = grep(@startswith, md, r\"(?<=^\\\\s*#).*\"\nanswers = grep(@startswith, md, r\"^.*#\\\\1$\", first = true)\n\n# Convert the extracted text to tuples and return it as a list\nreturn (Tuple(questions, answers), [])\nend\n```\nThis function uses `grep` to find all lines in the markdown text that start with either `#Question` or `#Answer`. It's using regex patterns to match the desired lines (`(?<=^\\\\s*#).*}` for questions and `^.*#\\\\1$` for answers, where `\\\\1` refers to the first captured group in the pattern (in this case, just `#Question` or `#Answer`).\n\nThe function then converts each sublist of matching lines into a tuple containing the question and answer text, respectively. The final result is returned as a list containing these tuples.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n```julia\njulia> md = \"## Question\\nThis is a question.\\n# Answer\\nThis is an answer.\"\n\"## Question\\nThis is a question.\\n# Answer\\nThis is an answer.\"\n\n@q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThe output should be: `([(\"This is a question.\", \"This is an answer.\")])`","status":200,"tokens":[108,362],"elapsed":6.469861666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
