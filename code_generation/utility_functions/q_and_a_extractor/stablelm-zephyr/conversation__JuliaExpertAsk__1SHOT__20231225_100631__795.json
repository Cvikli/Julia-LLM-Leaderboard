It checks for lines starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". When it finds either of these, it reads all newlines until it reaches either a line starting with \"# Answer\", or an empty line (to avoid following the answer with more content). Then it adds any required leading spaces in the question or answer (`line[:len(line)-2]`), and appends the end of each line (`endl`) to the result string. Finally, it returns the split question-answer text as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[145,273],"elapsed":5.043344333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
