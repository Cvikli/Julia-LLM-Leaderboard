It checks if it's a match for the `# Question` pattern (`r\"(?<=^# Question).*\"`) at the beginning of the line. If so, it sets `in_question` to True.\n2. If the next character on the same line is not `\\n`, then it's likely the start of an answer and sets `in_answer` to True. This helps for answers that span multiple lines or are indented as separate paragraphs.\n3. It checks if this line matches the `# Answer` pattern (`r\"(?<=^# Answer).*\"`) after finding a matching `# Question`. If so, it sets `answer` to the rest of the line (stripping leading/trailing spaces), and `in_question` back to False.\n4. It repeats steps 1-3 for all lines in the text.\n5. The function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer as strings or None, if either one is missing.","status":200,"tokens":[145,502],"elapsed":9.258192292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
