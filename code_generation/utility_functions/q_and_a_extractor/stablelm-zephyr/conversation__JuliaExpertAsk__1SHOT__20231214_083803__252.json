Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If your markdown text uses different hashtags or formatting, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[128,253],"elapsed":9.008633125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
