Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It may not work correctly if your markdown-formatted text has a different structure.","status":200,"tokens":[108,387],"elapsed":6.984245584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
