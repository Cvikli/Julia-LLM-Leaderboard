[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using the `each_line` function to iterate over lines in the markdown text and checking for `# Question` and `# Answer` tags.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in eachline(IOBuffer(md))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = replace(line[14:end], r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\", \"\")\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = replace(line[10:end], r\"^[ \\t]*\\n\", \"\")\n        end \n    end\n    \n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by looping through each line in the markdown string. If a line starts with `\"# Question\"` then it assigns that part of the line to `question` after removing the leading spaces and newline characters. Similarly, if a line starts with `\"# Answer\"`, it assigns that part of the line to `answer`.\n\nThe function finally returns the tuple of stripped `question` and `answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[99,265],"elapsed":8.274452083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
