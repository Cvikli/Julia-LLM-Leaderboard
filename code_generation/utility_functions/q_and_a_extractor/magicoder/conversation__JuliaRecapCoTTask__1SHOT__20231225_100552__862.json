[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a basic example of how you can extract the question and answer from the given markdown formatted text in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # splitting into lines \n\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    inQuestion = false\n    inAnswer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") || startswith(line, \"#question\")\n            inQuestion = true\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") || startswith(line, \"#answer\")\n            inAnswer = true\n        elseif inQuestion && !isempty(line)  # if it's a line in question and not empty\n            question *= lstrip(line) # appending to the question\n        elseif inAnswer && !isempty(line)  # if it's a line in answer and not empty\n            answer *= lstrip(line)   # appending to the answer\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` goes through each line of the markdown-formatted text. If a line starts with `# Question` or `#question`, it sets `inQuestion` to true and continues reading until an empty line is encountered. Similarly, if a line starts with `# Answer` or `#answer`, it sets `inAnswer` to true and continues reading until an empty line is encountered. During this time, any non-empty lines that come after are appended to the question and answer strings respectively.\n  \nThe function returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple. Note that this only works for very basic markdown formats and might not work correctly with more complex ones.","status":200,"tokens":[402,398],"elapsed":14.184411458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
