Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here is a simple function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Convert the markdown into an array of lines\n    question = \"\"           # Initialize the question and answer to empty strings\n    answer   = \"\"\n    \n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= ltrim(rtrim(line[13:end]))  # Extract the text of the question\n                                                      # and strip leading spaces and newline characters.\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= ltrim(rtrim(line[12:end]))    # Extract the text of the answer\n                                                      # and strip leading spaces and newline characters.\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)  # Return a tuple containing question and answer.\nend\n```\nYou can call this function with markdown text like so:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is your name?\n\n# Answer\nMy name is John Doe.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)  # Prints: \"Question: What is your name?\"\nprintln(\"Answer:   \", answer)    # Prints: \"Answer: My name is John Doe.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[99,343],"elapsed":10.663655917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
