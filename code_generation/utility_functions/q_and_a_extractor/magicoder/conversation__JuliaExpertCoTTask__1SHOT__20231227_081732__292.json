If so, it sets the corresponding boolean to `True` and initializes an empty string to which we will add the subsequent lines (excluding '#'). When encountering another section header or end of the markdown, it sets the corresponding boolean to False and appends the text to the question or answer string respectively. The extracted text is stripped of leading spaces and newlines using regex before being returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[239,400],"elapsed":18.984984916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
