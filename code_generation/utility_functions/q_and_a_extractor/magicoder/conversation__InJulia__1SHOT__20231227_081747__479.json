[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple function that uses the `split` and `strip` functions in Julia to extract both the question and answer from the markdown-formatted text.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    sections = split(md, \"# \")\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(section[12:end])\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(section[9:end])\n        end\n    end\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input `md` string into sections based on the \"# \" prefix. Then it iterates over each section, checking if the first 10 characters of the section are either \"Question\" or \"Answer\". If so, it assigns the rest of the section (after skipping the first 9 spaces and the first word) to the corresponding variable. Finally, it returns a tuple with both questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[99,240],"elapsed":7.572624709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
