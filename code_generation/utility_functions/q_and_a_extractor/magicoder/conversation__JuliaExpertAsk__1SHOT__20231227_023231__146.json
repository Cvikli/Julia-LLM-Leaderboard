If a line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `q_flag` to true, and if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `a_flag` to true. Any subsequent non-empty lines that start with space(s) are added to the question or answer (removing the leading spaces). The function finally returns the stripped version of both the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[138,312],"elapsed":9.882321291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
