[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this task, we will follow a systematic approach to create the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia. This function will process the markdown-formatted text, search for lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, extract the relevant text for both sections, and return them in a tuple.\n\nThe steps involved in solving this task are as follows:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task**:\n   - Reading and processing string lines: using string manipulation functions such as `startswith`, `strip`.\n   - Using regular expressions: to identify the relevant sections accurately.\n   - Working with tuples to organize the output.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\nLet's implement the function following these insights.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String, String}\n    lines = split(md, '\\n') # Split the markdown text into lines\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    capture = false\n    mode = :none # To track whether we are capturing question or answer\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            mode = :question # Start capturing Question\n            capture = true\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            mode = :answer # Start capturing Answer\n            capture = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if capture\n            if mode == :question\n                if isempty(question) # Ignore the initial empty captures\n                    question = strip(line)\n                else\n                    question *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n                end\n            elseif mode == :answer\n                if isempty(answer) # Ignore the initial empty captures\n                    answer = strip(line)\n                else\n                    answer *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**:\n- The function correctly splits the markdown text into lines.\n- It identifies when a question or answer section begins and switches modes accordingly.\n- It captures text for each section appropriately, with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n- Handles multiline questions and answers, maintaining their structure.\n- Returns the extracted text in a tuple as specified.\n\nThis implementation follows the instructions and should meet the requirements of extracting and returning the question and answer text from a markdown document.","status":200,"tokens":[349,486],"elapsed":32.8432115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
