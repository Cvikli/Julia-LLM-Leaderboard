Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this in Julia by creating a function `q_and_a_extractor` that iterates through each line of the markdown-formatted text `md`. The function should track when it enters a Question or Answer section and extract the text accordingly. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n') # Split the markdown content into lines\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue # Skip the current iteration and proceed to the next line\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if in_question\n            # Append the line to question, add a newline if question is not empty\n            question = question * (isempty(question) ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            # Append the line to answer, add a newline if answer is not empty\n            answer = answer * (isempty(answer) ? \"\" : \"\\n\") * strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer)) # Return the extracted question and answer, stripping any leading/trailing spaces or newlines\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n1. It splits the markdown text into lines.\n2. It then iterates over each line, checking if it signifies the start of a Question or Answer section.\n3. Depending on which section it's currently processing, it appends the line to either the `question` or `answer` string.\n4. It adds line breaks between lines of content in the same section but avoids adding unnecessary line breaks at the start or end of the content.\n5. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer, with any extra white space stripped from the beginning and end.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $(q_and_a[1])\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $(q_and_a[2])\")\n```\n\nThis script should output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[91,519],"elapsed":38.315511917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
