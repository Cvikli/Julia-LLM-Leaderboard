[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Our approach will involve the following steps:\n\n1. Split the markdown text into lines to process it line by line.\n2. Use a boolean flag to track whether we are currently within a Question or Answer section.\n3. Accumulate the lines belonging to the Question and Answer sections in two separate variables.\n4. Return the accumulated Question and Answer, ensuring we strip any leading or trailing whitespaces and newlines.\n\nHere is how we can implement this solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')  # Split the markdown into lines\n    question_lines = []      # To accumulate lines of the Question section\n    answer_lines = []        # To accumulate lines of the Answer section\n    in_question = false      # Flag to track if we are in the Question section\n    in_answer = false        # Flag to track if we are in the Answer section\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true    # We've entered the Question section\n            in_answer = false     # Ensure we are not in the Answer section\n            continue              # Skip the line that is a header\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false   # Ensure we are not in the Question section\n            in_answer = true      # We've entered the Answer section\n            continue              # Skip the line that is a header\n        end\n\n        # Accumulate lines for each section\n        if in_question\n            push!(question_lines, line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            push!(answer_lines, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Join lines and strip spaces and newlines\n    question = strip(join(question_lines, '\\n'))\n    answer = strip(join(answer_lines, '\\n'))\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function should meet the requirements for extracting and returning the text in the Question and Answer sections from a Markdown document. It processes each line to identify and then selectively accumulate text based on the current section, handling the transition between different sections properly.","status":200,"tokens":[348,476],"elapsed":26.649690875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
