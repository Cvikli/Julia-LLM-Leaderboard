[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I will define a function called `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input and extracts the Question and Answer parts from it. The function will return a tuple consisting of the Question text and the Answer text, after stripping any leading spaces and newlines. \n\nHere are the steps to achieve that:\n\n1. Split the markdown-formatted text into lines for easy processing.\n2. Initialize variables to keep track of whether the current line is part of the Question or Answer sections, and store the text of these sections.\n3. Iterate over each line of the markdown text. Based on the header of the sections (`# Question` or `# Answer`), update the flags that indicate we are inside the Question or Answer section and append the line of text to the respective variable if we are inside the correct section.\n4. Strip leading and trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted Question and Answer texts.\n5. Return the Question and Answer texts as a tuple.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the sections and store their text\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question_section = false\n    in_answer_section = false\n\n    # Iterate over each line, and append text to the appropriate variable based on the current section\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question_section = true\n            in_answer_section = false\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer_section = true\n            in_question_section = false\n        elseif in_question_section\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer_section\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's now test this function to ensure it works correctly:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: $q\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $a\")\n```\n\nThis should print out the correctly extracted Question and Answer.","status":200,"tokens":[349,509],"elapsed":52.712435042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
