Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, let's follow the approach step by step.\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step**:\n    - First, split the markdown text on the basis of sections identified by `\"# Question\"` and `\"# Answer\"`.\n    - Strip any leading and trailing spaces or newline characters from the extracted sections to clean the text.\n    - Return the cleaned question and answer text in a tuple.\n   \n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**:\n    \n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    sections = split(md, r\"# Question|# Answer\")\n    question = strip(sections[2])  # Extract and strip the question part\n    answer = strip(sections[3])  # Extract and strip the answer part\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n\n```julia\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")\n```\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**:\n    - For the provided markdown, the function should return the tuple with the question \"What is the capital of France?\" and the answer \"The capital of France is Paris.\". Let's verify this with the code.\n\nNow, I'll execute the function based on the defined approach.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    sections = split(md, r\"# Question|# Answer\")\n    question = strip(sections[2])  # Extract and strip the question part\n    answer = strip(sections[3])  # Extract and strip the answer part\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n\n# Executing the function with the provided data\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis solution logically addresses the task by accurately extracting and cleaning the relevant markdown sections.","status":200,"tokens":[208,439],"elapsed":34.511426083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
