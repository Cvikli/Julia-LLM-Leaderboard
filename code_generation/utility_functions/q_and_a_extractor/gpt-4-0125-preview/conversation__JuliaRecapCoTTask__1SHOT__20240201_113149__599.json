[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Then, I'll extract the text between these markers. Finally, stripping any leading/trailing spaces or newline characters from the extracted text to ensure the output is clean.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Regular expressions to find the sections for questions and answers\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\n\"\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\n\"\n\n    # Find starting positions\n    question_start = findnext(question_regex, md, 1)\n    answer_start = findnext(answer_regex, md, 1)\n    \n    # If either section is not found, return empty strings\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n\n    # Extract positions to slice from and to\n    question_start_pos = first(question_start) + length(match(question_regex, md).match) - 1\n    answer_start_pos = first(answer_start) + length(match(answer_regex, md).match) - 1\n    next_section_pos = findnext(r\"# \", md, answer_start_pos) # Assume a new section to end the answer, if exists\n\n    # Extract and clean text\n    question_text = strip(next_section_pos !== nothing ? md[question_start_pos+1:first(next_section_pos)-1] : md[question_start_pos+1:end])\n    answer_text = strip(next_section_pos !== nothing ? md[answer_start_pos+1:first(next_section_pos)-1] : md[answer_start_pos+1:end])\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**\n\nI'll walk through the algorithm to ensure it matches the requirements:\n\n- Uses regular expressions to correctly identify the start of the question and answer sections.\n- Handles the case where either of the sections might be missing by returning empty strings.\n- Correctly extracts and cleans the text between the identified indices.\n\nThis solution should correctly extract the question and answer sections from a markdown-formatted text, returning them as a tuple of strings, fulfilling the task's requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[349,561],"elapsed":34.301367875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
