[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Locate the headings for Question and Answer using regex.\n2. Extract the content between those headings.\n3. Clean the extracted content by stripping unnecessary whitespace and newlines.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String,String}\n    # Define regex patterns for Question and Answer headings\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n\"\n    \n    # Find positions of Question and Answer headings\n    question_start = findfirst(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(answer_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Edge case handling: If not found, return empty strings\n    if question_start === nothing || answer_start === nothing\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n    \n    # Adjust the positions to get content right after the headings\n    adjusted_question_start = question_start[2] + 1\n    adjusted_answer_start = answer_start[2] + 1\n    \n    # Find the content between Question and Answer, and after Answer\n    question_end = answer_start[1] - 1\n    answer_end = length(md)\n    \n    # Extract question and answer\n    question = strip(md[adjusted_question_start:question_end])\n    answer = strip(md[adjusted_answer_start:answer_end])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check that the solution is correct\n- I will pass a markdown string with clearly defined Question and Answer sections to the function and verify if it accurately extracts the desired contents. \n- I also need to ensure it handles cases where the `# Question` or `# Answer` markers might not be present, returning empty strings as a fail-safe.","status":200,"tokens":[348,504],"elapsed":41.24061875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
