[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Extract the text of these sections, ensuring to remove any leading and trailing spaces or newline characters.\n3. Return the extracted text in a tuple format `(question, answer)`.\n\nLet's implement the function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia.\n\n```julia\n\"\"\"\nExtracts Question and Answer text from markdown format.\n\n# Arguments\n- `md::AbstractString`: Markdown-formatted text.\n\n# Returns\n- `(String, String)`: Tuple containing extracted Question and Answer.\n\"\"\"\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Locate the start indices of Question and Answer sections\n    question_start = findfirst(\"## Question\", md)\n    answer_start = findfirst(\"## Answer\", md)\n    \n    # If either section is missing, return empty strings for both question and answer\n    if isnothing(question_start) || isnothing(answer_start)\n        return (\"\", \"\")\n    end\n    \n    # Extract sections.

Then, it extracts the text for each section, ensuring to not include the headings themselves. Finally, it trims any leading and trailing white spaces and newline characters from the extracted text and returns the `(question, answer)` tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[348,416],"elapsed":34.651137583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
