[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Define the `q_and_a_extractor` function that takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input.\n2. Use string manipulation techniques to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Extract the text for both sections, ensuring to strip any leading spaces and newlines.\n4. Return the extracted texts in a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nNow, let's start writing the code following these steps.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown into lines for processing\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question_section = false\n    answer_section = false\n    \n    # Initialize variables to hold the extracted question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each line to extract question and answer based on the section flags\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_section = true\n            answer_section = false  # Make sure to not collect answers in the question section\n            continue  # Skip the line that marks the beginning of a section\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            question_section = false\n            answer_section = true\n            continue  # Skip the line that marks the beginning of a section\n        end\n        \n        if question_section\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"  # Concatenate the line to the question string\n        elseif answer_section\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"  # Concatenate the line to the answer string\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from both question and answer\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet me now double-check this solution to ensure it correctly extracts the Question and Answer sections as required, stripping any leading spaces and newlines. \n\n- The function correctly initializes section flags (`question_section` and `answer_section`) to detect when it's inside a Question or Answer section.\n- It concatenates lines to `question` or `answer` variables upon detecting the active section.\n- It strips extra spaces and newlines from both the question and answer before returning them.\n\nThus, this solution meets the specified criteria.","status":200,"tokens":[348,475],"elapsed":36.753439,"_type":"aimessage"}]
