It returns a tuple `(question, answer)` with the extracted texts. The function assumes each markdown contains only one pair of question and answer sections and that these sections are well-formed.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Regular expressions to find the question and answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"(?<=# Question\\n).*?(?=\\n#|$)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"(?<=# Answer\\n).*?(?=\\n#|$)\"s\n    \n    # Extracting question and answer using regex\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extracted question and answer text\n    question_text = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.match) : \"\"\n    answer_text = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.match) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Introduction\nThis is a sample markdown document.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the purpose of this function?\n\n# Answer\nThe function extracts questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text.\n\n# Conclusion\nThis concludes the example.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract question and answer\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(\"Question: \", q)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", a)\n```\n\nThis function uses regular expressions to locate the question and answer sections. It assumes that each section is immediately followed by either another markdown header (denoted by `#`) or the end of the string. It uses lookahead and lookbehind assertions in the regular expressions for this purpose.\n\nNote: This implementation searches for the first occurrence of `# Question` and `# Answer` sections. It works under the assumption that the markdown text is well-formed and contains only one set of such sections. The functionality can be extended or modified based on more specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[91,425],"elapsed":27.53638225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
