Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is a Julia function named `q_and_a_extractor` which takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input and extracts the text in the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`. It returns a tuple containing the question and answer with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    \n    # Flag to know whether we're currently reading a Question or an Answer\n    collect_status = :none # could be :none, :question, or :answer\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a Question or Answer header\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            collect_status = :question\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            collect_status = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Based on the status, append the line to the respective list\n        if collect_status == :question\n            push!(question, line)\n        elseif collect_status == :answer\n            push!(answer, line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Join the collected lines into strings and strip leading/trailing whitespace\n    question_text = strip(join(question, \"\\n\"))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer, \"\\n\"))\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through each line in the input markdown string. It uses a flag (`collect_status`) to keep track of whether it's currently reading a question, an answer, or neither. Based on this flag, it appends lines to either the question list or the answer list until it encounters a change in the section. Finally, it joins the lines for both question and answer, strips any leading or trailing whitespace and newlines, and returns them as a tuple.\n\nPlease adjust the syntax for the markdown headers (`# Question` and `# Answer`) as per your actual markdown format if they happen to be different or include additional characters (e.g., trailing spaces).","status":200,"tokens":[91,434],"elapsed":30.157473334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
