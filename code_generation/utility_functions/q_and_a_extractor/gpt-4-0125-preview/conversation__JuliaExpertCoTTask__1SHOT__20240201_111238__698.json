Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Think through your approach step by step\n\nTo solve this task, follow these steps:\n\n1. Split the input markdown-formatted text into sections by looking for the markers `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the text following these markers.\n3. Clean up the extracted text by removing any leading or trailing white space and newline characters.\n4. Return the cleaned text as a tuple in the form `(question, answer)`.\n\n## Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n\nLet's implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function following the plan outlined above.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown text by lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize variables to store question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Variable to track whether we're reading a question or an answer\n    reading = nothing  # Can be \"question\", \"answer\", or nothing\n    \n    # Loop through each line\n    for line in lines\n        if starts_with(line, \"# Question\")\n            reading = \"question\"\n            continue\n        elseif starts_with(line, \"# Answer\")\n            reading = \"answer\"\n            continue\n        else\n            if reading == \"question\"\n                # Append line to question\n                question = string(question, line, \"\\n\")\n            elseif reading == \"answer\"\n                # Append line to answer\n                answer = string(answer, line, \"\\n\")\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Clean up question and answer strings\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Solve the task\n\nWe'll now use the function and apply it to the provided data to solve the task.\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n## Step 4: Check that your solution is correct\n\nAfter running the provided data through our implemented function, the expected output is the tuple:\n\n```julia\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis output is based on the assumption that our extraction and cleanup process works correctly as planned.","status":200,"tokens":[208,488],"elapsed":45.135224958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
