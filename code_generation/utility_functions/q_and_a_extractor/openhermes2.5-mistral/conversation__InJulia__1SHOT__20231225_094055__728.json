Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the following Julia function to extract questions and answers from a markdown-formatted text:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    sections = split(md, \"# Question\\n\")\n    question_index = findfirst(x -> occursin(\"# Answer\\n\", x), sections) - 1\n    if isempty(sections) || question_index < 0\n        return nothing\n    end\n    question = replace(strip(split(sections[1], \"\\n\")[2]), '\\r' => \"\")\n    answer = replace(strip(split(sections[question_index + 1], \"\\n\")[2]), '\\r' => \"\")\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a markdown-formatted text as input and splits the text at the point where the \"# Question\" section ends. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of \"# Answer\\n\", subtracts 1 to get the question section index, and checks if there are any sections or if the question section exists. If either of these conditions is not met, the function returns `nothing`. Otherwise, it strips any leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer sections and returns them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[105,282],"elapsed":8.922607625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
