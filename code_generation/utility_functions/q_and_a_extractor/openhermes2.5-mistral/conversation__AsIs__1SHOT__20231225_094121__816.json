The function uses regular expressions to search for sections starting with \"Question\" or \"Answer\", extracts the corresponding text, and removes any leading spaces and newlines before returning the results. If there are no \"Question\" or \"Answer\" sections found, the function returns `None`.","status":200,"tokens":[102,293],"elapsed":9.228510875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
