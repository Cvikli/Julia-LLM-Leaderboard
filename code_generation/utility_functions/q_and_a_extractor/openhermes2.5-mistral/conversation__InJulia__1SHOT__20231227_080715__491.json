Here's an implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the input string into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize empty arrays for questions and answers\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    \n    # Iterate over each line in the input string\n    for i in 1:length(lines)\n        # Check if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\"\n        if lines[i] == \"# Question\" || lines[i] == \"# Answer\"\n            # If it's a question, add it to the questions array\n            if starts_with(lines[i], \"# Question\")\n                question = \"\"\n                j = i+1\n                while !ends_with(lines[j], \"```\") && j < length(lines)\n                    question *= lines[j] * \"\\n\"\n                    j += 1\n                end\n                push!(questions, strip(question))\n            elseif starts_with(lines[i], \"# Answer\")\n                # If it's an answer, add it to the answers array\n                answer = \"\"\n                k = i+1\n                while lines[k] != \"\" && k < length(lines)\n                    answer *= lines[k] * \"\\n\"\n                    k += 1\n                end\n                push!(answers, strip(answer))\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Check if any questions or answers were found\n    if isempty(questions) || isempty(answers)\n        return nothing\n    else\n        # Return the corresponding question and answer as a tuple\n        return (questions[1], answers[1])\n    end\nend\n```\nYou can use this function by passing a markdown-formatted text to it, like so:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n# Answer\nParis\n\"\"\"\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis will output `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[105,543],"elapsed":17.130325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
