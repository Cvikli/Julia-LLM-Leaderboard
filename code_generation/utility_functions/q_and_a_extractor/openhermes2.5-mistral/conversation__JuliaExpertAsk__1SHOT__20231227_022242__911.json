It first initializes the `question` and `answer` variables to `nothing`. Then, it iterates over each line in the text after splitting by newlines. If the line starts with `# Question:`, it assigns the stripped text to `question`. If the line starts with `# Answer:`, it assigns the stripped text to `answer`. Finally, it returns a tuple of `(question, answer)` with any leading spaces and newlines stripped from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[146,261],"elapsed":8.538430541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
