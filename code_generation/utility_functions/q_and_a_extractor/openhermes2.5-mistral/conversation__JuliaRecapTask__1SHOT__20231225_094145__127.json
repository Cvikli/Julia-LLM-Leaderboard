[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nTo solve this task, we will first split the Markdown text by its sections. Then, we will find the indices of `# Question` and `# Answer` in the section names. Finally, we will extract the corresponding questions and answers from the sections' contents, removing any leading spaces and newlines. Here's the Julia code for this solution:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split by section names\n    sections = split(split(md, \"\\n\\n\"), \"# \\w+\")\n    \n    # Find indices of Question and Answer in the section names\n    question_idx = findfirst(isequal(\"# Question\"), sections)\n    answer_idx = findfirst(isequal(\"# Answer\"), sections)\n    \n    if question_idx == nothing || answer_idx == nothing\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    # Extract and clean questions and answers\n    question = trim(replace(sections[question_idx + 1], \"\\n\" => \"\"))\n    answer = trim(replace(sections[answer_idx + 1], \"\\n\" => \"\"))\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` takes an `AbstractString` representing the Markdown text and returns a tuple `(question, answer)`. If there are no sections with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it returns nothing. The extracted question and answer will have their leading spaces and newlines removed.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to proceed with this solution.","status":200,"tokens":[411,355],"elapsed":12.867051333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
