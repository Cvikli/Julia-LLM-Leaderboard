[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nHere's a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that extracts the text in markdown sections Question and Answer, as per the provided task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = String[]\n    answer = String[]\n    \n    for line in split(replace(md, \"\\n\" => \"\"), '\\t') # Strip tabs and newlines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            push!(question, lstrip(line[13:end])) # Trim leading spaces of 'Question' and the rest of the line\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            push!(answer, lstrip(line[9:end]))  # Trim leading spaces of 'Answer' and the rest of the line\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return question, answer\nend\n```\n\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function takes in a markdown-formatted text (`md`) as input. It initializes two empty arrays, `question` and `answer`, to store the extracted Question and Answer texts. \n\nThe function then iterates over each line of the provided `md` string after stripping tabs and newlines. If a line starts with \"# Question\", it trims the leading spaces and appends the trimmed text to the `question` array. Similarly, if a line starts with \"# Answer\", it trims the leading spaces and appends the trimmed text to the `answer` array.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted `question` and `answer` arrays.","status":200,"tokens":[413,375],"elapsed":13.518115792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
