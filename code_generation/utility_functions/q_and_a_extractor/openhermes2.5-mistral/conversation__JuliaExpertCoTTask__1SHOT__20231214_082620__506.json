Let's break down the task into smaller steps and solve it systematically:\n\n1. Think through our approach step by step:\n\t* Identify the markdown sections in the input text (# Question and # Answer)\n\t* Extract the text from each section separately\n\t* Return the answer in a tuple like (question, answer)\n2. Write any functions and other code we need:\n\t* `q_and_a_extractor` function to extract the text from the markdown sections\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Use the `q_and_a_extractor` function to extract the text from the # Question and # Answer sections in the input text\n\t* Return the extracted text in a tuple like (question, answer)\n4. Check that our solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the extracted text matches the original input text\n\nHere's the implemented `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(input :: String)\n    # Extract the # Question and # Answer sections\n    question_start = findstart(input, \"# Question\")\n    answer_start = findstart(input, \"# Answer\")\n\n    # Extract the text from each section\n    question = takewhile(input, section => section != answer_start)\n    answer = take(input, answer_start)\n\n    # Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    # Return the extracted text in a tuple\n    (question, answer)\nend\n```\nLet's test the function with some examples:\n```julia\nq_and_a_extractor(\"q_and_a_extractor# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\") # Should return (question, answer) = (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris\")\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"q_and_a_extractorThis is a test question.\") # Should return (question, answer) = (\"This is a test question.\", \"\")\n```\nI hope this helps!
