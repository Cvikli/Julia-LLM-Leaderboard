X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Let's get started on solving the task at hand using our systematic approach to problem-solving in Julia.\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n\n* Functions: `function` (creates a named function), `anonymoustuple` (creates an anonymous tuple), `$` (for string interpolation)\n* Control structures: `if-elseif-else`, `for`, `while`\n* Data types: arrays, slicing, tuples, namedtuples, dictionaries\n* Key syntax: variables, control structures\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe need to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. First, we will use the `Markdown` package to parse the input Markdown text and extract the relevant sections. We can use the `markdown‚Äù function from the `Markdown` package to parse the input text and get an object of type `MarkdownNode`.\n2. Next, we will use a combination of `find` and `match` functions to locate the `# Question` and `# Answer` markers in the Markdown text. We can use the `startswith` function to check if the current node starts with the `#` symbol, which indicates the beginning of a section.\n3. Once we have located the `# Question` and `# Answer` markers, we can extract the text between them using the `subs` function. We will use the `subs` function to replace the `#` symbols with empty strings, so that the extracted text is without leading `#` symbols.\n4. After extracting the text, we will strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using the `strip` function.\n\nHere's the code for step 2:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\n# Parse the input Markdown text\nmd = markdown\"input_text\"\n\n# Locate the # Question and # Answer markers\nquestion_marker = find(md, startswith(\"## Question\"))\nanswer_marker = find(md, startswith(\"## Answer\"))\n\n# Extract the text between the markers\nquestion_text = sub(md, question_marker[1], \"\").strip\nanswer_text = sub(md, answer_marker[1], \"\").strip\n\n# Return the extracted text\n(question_text, answer_text)\n```\nStep 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, we can test it on a few sample inputs. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Create some sample Markdown text with `# Question` and `# Answer` markers in different locations.\n2. Use the code from step 2 to extract the text between the markers for each of the sample inputs.\n3. Check that the extracted text matches the expected output for each input.\n\nBy following these steps, we can ensure that our solution is correct and will work for any input Markdown text.","status":200,"tokens":[399,668],"elapsed":28.780652792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
