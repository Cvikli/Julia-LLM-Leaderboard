It initializes two empty strings, one for the question and one for the answer. \n\nThen, it iterates over each line in the input string by splitting the string into lines and removing any carriage returns. For each line, it checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it finds a line starting with \"# Question\", it assigns the rest of the line to the `question` variable after stripping any leading spaces and newlines. If it finds a line starting with \"# Answer\", it assigns the rest of the line to the `answer` variable, also stripping any leading spaces and newlines. It then breaks out of the loop since we've found both the question and answer.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[146,327],"elapsed":10.450934875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
