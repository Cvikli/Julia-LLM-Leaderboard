[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Let's solve this task using the systematic approach. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `String.interpolate()` for string interpolation\n\t* `SubString()` for slicing strings\n\t* `split()` for splitting a string into an array\n\t* `splitfirst()` for splitting a string into an array without removing the delimiter\n\t* `collect()` for collecting all elements of an array or dictionary into a single string\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Read the input markdown text using the `Markdown` package\n\t* Parse the markdown text to extract the Question and Answer sections using regular expressions\n\t* Extract the text in each section using `String.sub()` or `SubString()`\n\t* Return the extracted text in a tuple like `(question, answer)`\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Use `println()` to verify that the extracted text matches the expected output\n\t* Test the function with different inputs to ensure it works correctly\n\nHere's the implemented code:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nusing StringTemplate\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Parse the markdown text using the Markdown package\n    doc = parse(Markdown, md)\n    \n    # Extract the Question and Answer sections\n    question = String.interpolate(\"## Question: \", doc[\"questions\"][])\n    answer = String.interpolate(\"## Answer: \", doc[\"answers\"][])\n    \n    # Extract the text in each section\n    extracted_question = SubString(question, 1, length(question) - 1)\n    extracted_answer = SubString(answer, 1, length(answer) - 1)\n    \n    # Return the extracted text in a tuple like (question, answer)\n    return (extracted_question, extracted_answer)\nend\n\n# Test the function with different inputs\nprintln(\"Input: $md\")\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nIn this code, we first parse the input markdown text using the `Markdown` package. We then extract the Question and Answer sections using regular expressions, and extract the text in each section using `SubString()`. Finally, we return the extracted text in a tuple like `(question, answer)`.\n\nNote that we use `StringTemplate` to interpolate the `# Question` and `# Answer` prefixes. This allows us to easily modify the template for different inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[11,562],"elapsed":20.976321292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
