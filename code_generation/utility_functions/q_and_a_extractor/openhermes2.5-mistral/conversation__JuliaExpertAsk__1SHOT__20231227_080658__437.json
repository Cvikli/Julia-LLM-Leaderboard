When it encounters a \"# Question\" line, it starts building the question by concatenating all non-empty lines until it encounters a \"# Answer\" line. Similarly, when it encounters a \"# Answer\" line, it starts building the answer by concatenating all non-empty lines until it encounters a \"# Question\" or an empty line. If it doesn't find both a question and an answer, it returns `nothing`. Otherwise, it returns the question and answer as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[146,454],"elapsed":14.542931375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
