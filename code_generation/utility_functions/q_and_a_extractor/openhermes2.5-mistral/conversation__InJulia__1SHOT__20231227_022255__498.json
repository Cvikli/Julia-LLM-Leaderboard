[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To extract the text from the markdown sections Question and Answer, we can use regular expressions to find and extract the desired content. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    r_q = r\"^# *(Question):.*$\"\n    r_a = r\"^# *(Answer):.*$\"\n    \n    m_q = match(r_q, md)\n    m_a = match(r_a, md)\n    \n    if isnothing(m_q) || isnothing(m_a)\n        return nothing\n    else\n        question = chop(replace(m_q[2], \"\\n\" => \"\"))\n        answer = chop(replace(m_a[2], \"\\n\" => \"\"))\n        \n        return (question, answer)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines two regular expressions `r_q` and `r_a` to match the Question and Answer sections, respectively. The regular expressions look for lines starting with \"# Question:\" or \"# Answer:\", followed by any optional whitespace and then any text until the end of the line. \n\nThe function then uses the `match()` function twice to find the positions of these patterns in the input string `md`. If either match fails (i.e., returns `nothing`), the function returns `nothing`, indicating that no Question and Answer sections were found.\n\nIf both matches succeed, the function extracts the question and answer from the matching lines by indexing the `Match` objects returned by `match()`. It then applies the `chop()` function to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[105,395],"elapsed":12.437525042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
