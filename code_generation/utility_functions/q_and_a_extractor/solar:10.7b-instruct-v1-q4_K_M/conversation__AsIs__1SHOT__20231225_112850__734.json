It then splits the stripped content into sections and iterates through them, extracting each question-answer pair based on their position in the markdown. The markdown library is used for converting potential HTML elements back to plain text. Remember to replace \"your_markdown_file.md\" with the path to your actual .md file containing the questions and answers formatted as `# Question` and `# Answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[104,426],"elapsed":25.352220375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
