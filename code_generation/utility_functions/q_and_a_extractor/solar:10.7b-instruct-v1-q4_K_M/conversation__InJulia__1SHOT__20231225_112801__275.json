Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia that can handle this task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    \n    # Split markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, r\"\\n\")\n    \n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the current line starts with '# Question'\n        if line[1:10] == \"# Question\"\n            # Add empty question and answer to lists\n            push!(questions, \"\")\n            push!(answers, \"\")\n            \n            # Move to next element in list since we just found a question marker\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Check if the current line starts with '# Answer'\n        if line[1:8] == \"# Answer\"\n            # Move to next element in list since we just found an answer marker\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Append non-empty strings after stripping leading spaces and newlines\n        trimmed = strip(chop(line))\n        if !isempty(trimmed)\n            # Check whether we are currently processing a question or answer\n            if length(questions) > 0\n                push!(questions, trimmed)\n            elseif length(answers) > 0\n                push!(answers, trimmed)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return zip(questions, answers) # Return a tuple of question-answer pairs\nend\n```\n\nYou can now call this function using the `md` text as input to extract all questions and their corresponding answers. This example uses the built-in functions `split`, `strip`, and `chop`. The `zip` function is used to combine corresponding elements from multiple lists into a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[107,413],"elapsed":24.614814959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
