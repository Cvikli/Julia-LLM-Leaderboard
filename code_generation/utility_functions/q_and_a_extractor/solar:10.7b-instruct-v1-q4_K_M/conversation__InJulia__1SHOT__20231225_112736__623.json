It uses string manipulation, filtering, and slicing to find sections that start with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" and then cleans up the extracted text by removing leading spaces and newlines. Finally, it returns a tuple of `(question, answer)` arrays.","status":200,"tokens":[107,361],"elapsed":21.573633584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
