[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Regular expressions to match markdown headers\n2. String manipulation functions like `strip` and `rstrip`\n3. Array manipulation functions like `split`, `push!`, and `deleteat!`\n4. A data structure to store questions and answers, such as a tuple or a dictionary\n\nNow let's write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions_answers = Dict()\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines) do\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question: \")\n            question = split(line, \": \")[2]\n            question = strip(question)\n\n            next_line_index = findnext(x -> startswith(x, \"# Answer: \"), lines, i + 1)\n            answer = \"\"\n\n            if !isnothing(next_line_index)\n                answer = split(lines[next_line_index], \"\\n\")[1]\n                answer = strip(answer)\n                deleteat!(lines, next_line_index:end) # remove Answer line and following lines\n            end\n\n            pushfirst!(values(questions_answers), (question, answer))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return values(questions_answers)\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question: What is Julia?\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\n\n# Answer: Julia is an open-source programming language that was designed specifically for data science and numerical analysis.
