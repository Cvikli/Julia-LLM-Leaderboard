It first splits the text into lines and maintains two arrays to store questions and answers, respectively. As it goes through each line, if it encounters a question line, it appends it to the questions array. If it encounters an answer line, it appends both the question and the answer lines to their respective arrays. Once all the lines have been processed, it checks for any errors (missing question or mismatched number of questions and answers) and returns the first question-answer pair as a tuple. The function also removes leading/trailing whitespaces from the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[139,439],"elapsed":24.32538575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
