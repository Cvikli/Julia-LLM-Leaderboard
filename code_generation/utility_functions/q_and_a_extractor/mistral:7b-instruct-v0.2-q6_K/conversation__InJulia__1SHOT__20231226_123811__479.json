For example:\n\n```julia\nfunction add(x, y)\n    return x + y\nend\n```\n\nSome text after first question.\n\n## Question 2\nWhat is a tuple in Julia?\n\n## Answer 2\nIn Julia, a tuple is a collection of heterogeneous or homogeneous elements enclosed by parentheses `()`. Tuples are immutable and can be indexed using the square bracket notation `[]` to access their elements. For example:\n\n```julia\nmy_tuple = (1, \"two\", 3.0)\nprintln(my_tuple[1]) # Output: 1\n```\n\"\"\"\nquestions_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Questions:\")\nfor question in questions_answers[1]\n    println(\"- $question\")\nend\nprintln(\"\\nAnswers:\")\nfor answer in questions_answers[2]\n    println(\"- $answer\")\nend\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```julia\nQuestions:\n- How to write a function in Julia?\n- What is a tuple in Julia?\n\nAnswers:\n- A function in Julia is defined using the keyword `function` followed by its name, input arguments (in parentheses), and the function body enclosed by curly braces `{}`.
