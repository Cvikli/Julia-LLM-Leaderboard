[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and special instructions, here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for i in 1:length(lines)\n        if startswith(lines[i], \"# Question:\")\n            question = StringTrim(strip(lines[i+1]))\n            push!(questions, question)\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if startswith(lines[i], \"# Answer:\")\n            answer = StringTrim(join(lines[i+1:i+end], \" \"))\n            push!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions, answers)\nend\n\nfunction startswith(str::AbstractString, prefix::AbstractString)\n    length(prefix) > 0 && strstartswith(str, prefix)\nend\n\nfunction StringTrim{T<:AbstractString}(str::T) where T <: AbstractString\n    trim(chomp(str))\nend\n```\n\nThis `q_and_a_extractor` function uses a loop to iterate through each line of the input markdown string. When it encounters a question line, it extracts and stores the question text in an array. Similarly, when it encounters an answer line, it extracts and stores the answer text in another array. The final result is a tuple containing the question and answer arrays.\n\nThe `startswith` helper function checks if a string starts with a given prefix. The `StringTrim` helper function trims leading whitespaces from a given string. These helper functions are defined inside the main function to keep things organized and readable.\n\nThis solution should cover the base case of extracting questions and answers in simple markdown texts. However, it might not be robust enough for more complex markdown files with nested sections or other non-standard formats. In such cases, additional parsing logic may be required using external markdown parsing libraries like `Markdown.jl`.","status":200,"tokens":[406,469],"elapsed":28.359496208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
