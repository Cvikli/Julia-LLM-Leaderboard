It uses a vector to store each question and answer, and checks for the presence of `# Question:` and `# Answer:` in each line. Once it detects a question or an answer, it stores it accordingly and moves on to the next line until it reaches the end of the document. The function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer once both have been identified. It also checks for any invalid markdown format at the end of processing.","status":200,"tokens":[139,293],"elapsed":16.458905125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
