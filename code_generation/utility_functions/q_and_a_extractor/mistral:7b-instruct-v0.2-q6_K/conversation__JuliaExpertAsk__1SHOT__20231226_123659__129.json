It first splits the text into lines, then checks for lines starting with \"# Question:\" or \"# Answer:\". When it finds a question line, it adds it to the questions array; when it finds an answer line, it adds it to the answers array and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it joins the arrays into strings, strips any leading spaces, and returns the tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[139,295],"elapsed":16.624307209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
