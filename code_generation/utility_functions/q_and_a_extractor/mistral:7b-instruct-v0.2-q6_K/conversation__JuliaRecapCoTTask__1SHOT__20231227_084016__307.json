[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on your special instruction, I will write a function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia to extract all text in markdown sections with the labels \"Question\" and \"Answer\", and return them as a tuple. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # Split the markdown string into individual lines\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    current_section = nothing\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question:\")\n            current_section = :question\n            question = split(line, \":\")[2] # Extract the question text\n            question = strip(question) # Remove leading and trailing spaces\n            push!(questions, question)\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer:\") && !isempty(questions)\n            current_section = :answer\n            answer = join(lines[findfirst(x->startswith(x, \"## \"), lines) - 1:end], \"\\n\") # Extract the answer text\n            answer = replace(answer, r\"^[\\s\\t]*|[\\s\\t]+$\", \"\") # Remove leading and trailing spaces\n            push!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    length(questions) == length(answers || throw(ErrorException(\"Mismatched question and answer\"))) && return (questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` uses a state machine approach to keep track of the current section (question or answer). It splits the given markdown string by newline characters and iterates through each line. When it encounters a \"Question\" label, it extracts the question text and pushes it into an array called `questions`. The function keeps track of the current_section as :question. If the function then encounters an \"Answer\" label and there's a valid question in the queue, it extracts the answer text and pushes it into an array called `answers`. The function checks that both arrays have the same length and returns them as a tuple if they do.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a markdown-formatted string like:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"# Question: What is Julia?\n## Answer: Julia is a high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other popular scientific languages.\n\n# Question: How can I install Julia?\n## Answer: You can download and install Julia from the official website (https://julialang.org/downloads/) or use package managers like Homebrew on MacOS or apt-get on Linux systems. \"\"\"\n\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md) # Extract questions and answers using the function\nprintln(\"Questions: \", questions)\nprintln(\"Answers: \", answers)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[406,673],"elapsed":39.443322708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
