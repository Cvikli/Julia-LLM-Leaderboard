Here's an example of how you could implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts all text in markdown sections labeled `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n    Returns a tuple containing the question and answer, with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use regular expressions to match the markdown sections\n    question_match = re.findall(r=\"# Question\\s+(\\S+)\", md)\n    answer_match = re.findall(r=\"# Answer\\s+(\\S+)\", md)\n\n    # Extract the text from each match\n    question = \"\".join(question_match).strip()\n    answer = \"\".join(answer_match).strip()\n\n    return question, answer\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* `re.findall()` is used to find all occurrences of the `# Question` and `# Answer` labels in the markdown text. The `r\"`\" syntax is used to specify the regular expression pattern to match.\n* The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the extracted text.\n* The function returns a tuple containing the question and answer, with any leading or trailing spaces removed.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```\n# Example markdown text\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n\n# Another question: How old is the Earth?\nAnswer: 4.5 billion years old\n\"\"\"\n\n# Call the function and extract the question and answer\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprint(f\"Question: {question}\")\nprint(f\"Answer: {answer}\")\n```\nThis should output:\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[82,449],"elapsed":15.354926083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
