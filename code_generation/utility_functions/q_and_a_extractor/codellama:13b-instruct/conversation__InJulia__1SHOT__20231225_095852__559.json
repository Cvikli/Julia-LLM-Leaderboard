Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Extract the question and answer sections from the markdown text\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(line[12:end])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(line[9:end])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the extracted text in a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `split` function to split the markdown text into individual lines. It then iterates over each line and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If so, it extracts the text from that line and stores it in the appropriate variable. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer text.\n\nYou can use this function to extract the question and answer sections of a markdown file like this:\n```julia\n# Read the markdown file into a string\nmd = read(\"example.md\", String)\n\n# Extract the question and answer sections\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n\n# Print the extracted text\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[107,341],"elapsed":18.937487041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
