[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution to the task:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    for section in md.split(\"\\n\"):\n        if section.startswith(\"# Question\"):\n            question = section[len(\"# Question\"):].strip()\n            questions.append(question)\n        elif section.startswith(\"# Answer\"):\n            answer = section[len(\"# Answer\"):].strip()\n            answers.append(answer)\n    return tuple(questions), tuple(answers)\nend\n```\nThis solution uses the `split` method to split the input markdown string into individual sections, and then iterates over each section to extract questions and answers using the `startswith` method. The extracted text is then stripped of any leading spaces and newlines using the `strip` method. Finally, the extracted questions and answers are returned as a tuple.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input markdown string is in the format of \"# Question\\nQuestion Text\\n# Answer\\nAnswer Text\". If the input string is in a different format, the solution may need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[407,257],"elapsed":17.443188708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
