Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Find all sections in the markdown text that start with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    questions = filter(x -> startswith(x, \"# Question\"), split(md, \"\\n\"))\n    answers = filter(x -> startswith(x, \"# Answer\"), split(md, \"\\n\"))\n\n    # Extract the question and answer text from each section\n    question_texts = [strip(x[11:end]) for x in questions]\n    answer_texts = [strip(x[9:end]) for x in answers]\n\n    # Create a tuple of (question, answer) pairs\n    q_and_a_pairs = [(q, a) for (q, a) in zip(question_texts, answer_texts)]\n\n    return q_and_a_pairs\nend\n```\nThis function first finds all sections in the markdown text that start with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". It then extracts the question and answer text from each section using the `strip` function to remove leading spaces and newlines. Finally, it creates a tuple of (question, answer) pairs using the `zip` function.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is only one question and answer per section in the markdown text. If there are multiple questions or answers per section, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[247,334],"elapsed":29.937149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
