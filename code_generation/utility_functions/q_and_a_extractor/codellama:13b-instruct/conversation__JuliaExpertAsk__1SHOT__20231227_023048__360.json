It sets two boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to keep track of which section is currently being processed. If a line matches the start of a question, it sets `in_question` to true and continues to the next iteration. If a line matches the start of an answer, it sets `in_answer` to true and continues to the next iteration.\n\nIf `in_question` is true, it appends the current line to the `question` string after stripping leading spaces and newlines. If `in_answer` is true, it appends the current line to the `answer` string after stripping leading spaces and newlines.\n\nFinally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[145,400],"elapsed":22.596363917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
