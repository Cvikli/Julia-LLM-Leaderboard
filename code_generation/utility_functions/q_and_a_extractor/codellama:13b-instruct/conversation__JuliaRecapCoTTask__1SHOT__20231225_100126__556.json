[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

In this task, we will focus on using the standard library to solve the problem at hand.\n\nFirst, let's start by defining the `q_and_a_extractor` function. We can use the `strip` function to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = strip(\"Question: $(md[r\"# Question\"]))\")\n    answer = strip(\"Answer: $(md[r\"# Answer\"])\")\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first extract the text between the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" sections using regular expressions. We then use `strip` to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. Finally, we return a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nNext, let's test our function on some sample markdown text.\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\nThe meaning of life is to find your purpose and fulfill it.\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis should return a tuple containing the question and answer as strings.\n\nWe can also use this function with multiple questions and answers in the same markdown text by using a regular expression that matches all instances of \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\".\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\nThe meaning of life is to find your purpose and fulfill it.\n\n# Question\nWhat is the purpose of life?\n\n# Answer\nThe purpose of life is to be happy and fulfilled.\n\"\"\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis should return a tuple containing all questions and answers as strings.\n\nIn summary, we have defined a `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia that extracts all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and returns the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. We use regular expressions to match the \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" sections and strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","status":200,"tokens":[410,514],"elapsed":32.624054375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
