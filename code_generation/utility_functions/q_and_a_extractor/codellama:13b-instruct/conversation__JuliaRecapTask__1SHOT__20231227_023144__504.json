[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

First, we define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes in a markdown-formatted string and returns a tuple of strings representing the question and answer. We use the keyword `function` to indicate the start of the function definition. The input argument is defined as `md::String`, which specifies that it should be a String object. The return type is also defined using `Tuple{String, String}`.\n\nNext, we define two empty strings called `question` and `answer`. We use these variables to store the extracted text for question and answer, respectively.\n\nThe core logic of the function starts with a loop that iterates over each line in the input string using `split(md, \"\\n\")`. This produces an array of strings, where each element represents a single line in the input text. We use a `for` loop to iterate over this array and perform actions on each line.\n\nInside the loop, we check if the current line contains the string \"# Question\" using the `occursin()` function. If it does, we concatenate the current line to the `question` string without any leading spaces or newlines. This is done using the `strip(line[1:end-1])` expression, which removes any leading spaces and newlines from the current line before appending it to the question text.\n\nIf the current line does not contain \"# Question\", we check if it contains \"# Answer\" using the same technique as above. If it does, we concatenate the current line to the `answer` string in a similar way to how we handled the question.\n\nOnce we have extracted both the question and answer text from the input markdown string, we return the tuple `(question, answer)` from the function using the `return` statement.\n\nThat's it! Our `q_and_a_extractor()` function takes in a markdown-formatted string as input and returns a tuple of question and answer text strings.","status":200,"tokens":[407,595],"elapsed":37.001260084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
