It returns a tuple containing the question and answer. The function uses the `startswith()` function to check if a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and then extracts the corresponding text using `strip()`.","status":200,"tokens":[107,327],"elapsed":18.306718417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
