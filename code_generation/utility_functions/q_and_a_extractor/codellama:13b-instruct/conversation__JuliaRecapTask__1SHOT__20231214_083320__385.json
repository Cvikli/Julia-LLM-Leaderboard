[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Let's break down the problem into smaller steps to solve it systematically.\n\nStep 1: Recall Julia Snippets (5 minutes)\n\n* Review the Julia language syntax and features that will be useful for this task, such as variables, control structures, functions, arrays, slicing, tuples, namedtuples, dictionaries, and string interpolation.\n* Identify any specific snippets or patterns that we can reuse from previous projects or common Julia functions to help solve the problem more efficiently.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task (30 minutes)\n\n* Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted string as input and returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer text, stripped of any leading spaces and newlines.\n* Use regular expressions or other parsing techniques to identify the markdown sections (e.g., `# Question` and `# Answer`) in the input string.\n* Implement a recursive descent parser or other parsing technique to extract the question and answer text from the marked up section.\n* Handle any special characters or formatting in the input text as needed.\n\nStep 3: Double-check Solution (10 minutes)\n\n* Test the function with various inputs to ensure it works correctly and returns the expected output.\n* Use print statements or the debugger to verify that the function is working as intended.\n* Check for any edge cases or corner cases that may require special handling.\n\nStep 4: Refactor and Optimize (10 minutes)\n\n* Review the code for readability, performance, and maintainability.\n* Use Julia's type system and other language features to improve the code's expressiveness and efficiency.\n* Consider using higher-level abstractions or specialized libraries to simplify the code and improve performance.\n\nTotal time: 1 hour\n\nNote: The above timings are approximate and may vary depending on your familiarity with Julia and the complexity of the input data.","status":200,"tokens":[399,428],"elapsed":19.227971125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
