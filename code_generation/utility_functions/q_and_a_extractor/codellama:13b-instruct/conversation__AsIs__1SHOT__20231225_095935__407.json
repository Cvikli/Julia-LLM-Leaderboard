[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `.*?` quantifier is used to match any character (except for line terminators) between the `Question` and `Answer` headings, but it does not match the heading itself. The `(?=\\n#|\\Z)` lookahead assertion is used to ensure that the match only occurs if there is a newline followed by the `# Answer` heading or if it is at the end of the string.\n\nThe function then uses the `strip()` method to remove any leading spaces and newlines from each extracted question and answer, and returns them in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[104,297],"elapsed":16.595677625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
