[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown document `md` with many lines. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer as a NamedTuple with keys `question` and `answer`. For a section to be valid, it must start at the beginning of the line. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.

The function assumes that each section starts at the beginning of a new line, so it will only work if the markdown document is properly formatted.","status":200,"tokens":[127,399],"elapsed":22.928453291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
