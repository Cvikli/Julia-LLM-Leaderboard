It then loops through each section and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it extracts the question or answer text using a regular expression. Finally, it returns the extracted text in a tuple.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and contains only one Question and one Answer section. If there are multiple sections with the same header level, the function may not behave as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[145,294],"elapsed":16.803185291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
