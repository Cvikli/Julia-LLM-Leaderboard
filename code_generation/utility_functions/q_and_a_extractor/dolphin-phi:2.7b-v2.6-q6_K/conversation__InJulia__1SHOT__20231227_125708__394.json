[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of the function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nusing BaseExtractors\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\nmd.parse(BaseExtractors.HTML())\nfor block in md.blocks()\nif block[\"class\"] == \"Question\" && !isempty(block[\"children\"][1])\nquestion = BlockStrings.first(block[\"children\"])\nbreak\nend\nif block[\"class\"] == \"# Answer\" && !isempty(block[\"children\"][0])\nanswer = BlockStrings.first(block[\"children\"])\nbreak\nend\nend\n\nreturn (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the given `md` string using Julia's Markdown parser, which returns an array of blocks. Then it iterates over each block to find the one with class \"Question\" and another with \"# Answer\". The strings within these blocks are then extracted and returned as a tuple. Note that `BlockStrings` is used for accessing the text content within a block.\n\nPlease, modify this function according to your requirements if there are any changes in markdown formatting or if you want to use different methods to parse the markdown string. The main idea of the implementation remains the same. \n\nAlso, please note that this solution will return only the first instance of a `# Answer` block. If there could be multiple blocks with '# Answer' within the markdown, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[102,345],"elapsed":9.269250917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
