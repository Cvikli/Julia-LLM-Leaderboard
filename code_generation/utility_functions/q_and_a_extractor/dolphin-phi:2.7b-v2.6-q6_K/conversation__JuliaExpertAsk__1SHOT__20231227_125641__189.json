It then iterates through each section, checking if it starts with '# Question' or '# Answer'. If so, it extracts the question and answer parts from each section using the `unpack` function and returns them in a tuple after stripping leading spaces and newlines. If no such sections are found, an empty tuple is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[139,232],"elapsed":6.558088875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
