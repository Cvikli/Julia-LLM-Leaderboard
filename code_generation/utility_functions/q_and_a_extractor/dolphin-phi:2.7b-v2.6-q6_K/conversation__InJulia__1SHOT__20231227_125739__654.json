Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can extract the question and answer from a Markdown formatted text using the `md` module in Julia. Here is a simple function that will do this:\n\n```julia\nusing md\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n# Extract all markdown sections\nsections = parseMarkdown(md)\n\nfor section in sections\nif section['type'] == 'Question'\nquestion = stringfirst(section, \"^#\")[1:end]\nbreak\nelse if section['type'] == 'Answer'\nanswer = stringfirst(section, \"#\", end)\nbreak\nelse:\nerror(\"Could not find a question or answer in the markdown.\")\n\n# Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\nquestion = stripNewlineAndSpaces(question)\nanswer = stripNewlineAndSpaces(answer)\n\nreturn (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `parseMarkdown(md)` is a helper function that parses the markdown text into sections. It returns an array of dictionaries for each section in the markdown text where each dictionary contains the type and content of the section. \n- The `stringfirst` function is used to find the first occurrence of a specified pattern in the string. In this case, it finds the first occurrence of '#' followed by any characters until the end of the line for a question or \"#\" followed by any character up to the end of the line for an answer.\n- The `stripNewlineAndSpaces` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text. It removes all leading and trailing white spaces as well as any newlines at the beginning of the string. \n- If no question or answer is found in the markdown, an error message is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[102,404],"elapsed":10.657617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
