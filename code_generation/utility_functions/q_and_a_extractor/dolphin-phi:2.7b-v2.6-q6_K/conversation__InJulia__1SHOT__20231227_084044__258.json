[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\nanswer = \"\"\nfor line in splitlines(md)\nif line == \"# Question\" || line == \"# Answer\"\nend_question = md.indexOf(\"#\", line+1)\nstart_answer = md.indexOf(\"Answer: \", end_question+1)\nanswer += trim(md[start_answer...end_question])\nelseif line != \"\" && !isempty(line)\ntrim(line)\nbreak\nend\nreturn (splitfirst(linesep, answer), answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works as follows:\n\n1. It first splits the input string into an array of lines using `splitlines`.\n2. It then iterates over each line in this array. For every line:\n- If it's a question or answer tag (`# Question` or `# Answer`), it extracts the text that follows the starting tag and before the ending tag using `indexOf`. \n- The tags are included in the answer as well, so we need to find their index from the next line after they appear. We use slicing with `line+1` for this.\n- It then concatenates the extracted text with the current answer.\n3. If the current line is not a question or answer tag and is not empty, it breaks out of the loop, as we have found all the questions and answers in the input string.\n4. The function returns the list of questions and answers as a tuple: the first element is an array of questions and the second element is their corresponding answers.","status":200,"tokens":[102,386],"elapsed":10.172458875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
