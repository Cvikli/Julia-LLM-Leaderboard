[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the provided instructions and my understanding of Julia, here's a solution for your task:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(strip(md), \"\\n\")\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if line == \"\" || line[1] == '#' && startswith(line, \"Question: \")\n            push!(questions, String[line[8:end]])\n        elseif line == \"\" || line[1] == '#' && startswith(line, \"Answer: \")\n            push!(answers, String[line[7:end]])\n        end\n    end\n\n    length(questions) > 0 || throw(ArgumentError(\"No valid question found in the markdown text\"))\n\n    return (map(strip, questions), map(strip, answers))\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the given markdown text into lines and then iterates through them. It stores all the `Question:` and `Answer:` lines in separate arrays. After that, it checks if there are any valid question and answer sections in the provided text before returning the extracted questions and answers as a tuple.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that each Question section is immediately followed by its respective Answer section without any content in between them. If this assumption does not hold, then the function needs to be modified accordingly to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[406,336],"elapsed":15.609449,"_type":"aimessage"}]
