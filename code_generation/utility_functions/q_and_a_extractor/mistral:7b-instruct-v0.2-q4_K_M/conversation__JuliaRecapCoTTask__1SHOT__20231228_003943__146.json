X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - String manipulation using `rstrip()`, `lstrip()`, `chomp()`\n   - Regular expressions with `match()` and `sub()` functions\n   - Functions and anonymous functions\n   - Control structures like `if-elseif-else`\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\nFirst, let's define a helper function `extract_section(line::String)` to identify whether a line is a question or an answer. Then we will use this helper function inside our main function `q_and_a_extractor`.\n\n```julia\nfunction extract_section(line::String)\n    if startswith(line, \"# Question\") || startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n        return line[12:end] # Remove the '#' and 'Question' or 'Answer' part\n    else\n        return \"\"\n    end\nend\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions_answers = []\n\n    current_question = \"\"\n    for line in lines\n        if current_question != \"\"\n            answer = extract_section(line)\n            push!(questions_answers, (current_question, answer))\n            current_question = \"\"\n        else\n            question = extract_section(line)\n            if !isempty(question)\n                current_question = question\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Handle the last question and answer if any\n    if !isempty(current_question) && !isempty(lines[end])\n        answer = extract_section(lines[end])\n        push!(questions_answers, (current_question, answer))\n    end\n\n    return questions_answers\nend\n```\n\nThis `q_and_a_extractor` function will extract all the question-answer pairs from a given markdown text and store them as tuples in an array.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nTo test the function, let's provide it with some markdown input. We can define the following `md_test` variable containing the markdown text. Then we will call our `q_and_a_extractor` function and check its output against expected results.\n\n```julia\nmd_test = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is a question text.\n\n# Answer 1\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n# Question 2\nWhat's the next number in this sequence? 1, 1, 2, ?\n\n# Answer 2\nThe next number in this sequence is 3.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md_test)\nexpected = [(\"Question 1\", \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\"), (\"Question 2\", \"The next number in this sequence is 3.\")]\n\nprintln(\"Function output:\")\nprintln(questions_answers)\nprintln(\"Expected output:\")\nprintln(expected)\n```\n\nBy comparing the function output and expected output, we can ensure that our `q_and_a_extractor` function is working correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[406,792],"elapsed":34.788322667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
