[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and special instructions provided, here is the approach to solve this task using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions for extracting lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\".\n   - String manipulation functions like `strip` for removing leading spaces and newlines.\n   - Array manipulation functions like `split` for splitting lines by newline character.\n   - Dictionaries for storing extracted questions and answers as key-value pairs.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\nFirst, let's define a regular expression pattern to extract the lines starting with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". We can then use this pattern to find all occurrences in the given markdown text `md` using the `match` function. For each match, we will extract the question and answer text by splitting the lines based on newline characters (`\\n`) using the `split` function.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    regex = r\"^#\\s*(Question|Answer)\\s*\"\n    matches = matchall(Regex(regex), md)\n    questions_answers = Dict()\n\n    for match in matches\n        question_line = String(match.pre)\n        question = strip(split(question_line, \"\\n\")[1])\n\n        answer_lines = split(String(match.post), \"\\n\")\n        answer = strip(answer_lines[1])\n\n        questions_answers[question] = answer\n    end\n\n    return questions_answers\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nYou can test the `q_and_a_extractor` function with some sample markdown text to ensure it correctly extracts and returns questions and answers as a dictionary.\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is the question for Q1.\n\n# Answer 1\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed commodo, magna quis bibendum auctor, nisi erat tincidunt lectus, a scelerisque turpis mauris vel lacinia. Nunc eget risus et ante venenatis laoreet.\n\n# Question 2\nWhat is the answer for Q2?\n\n# Answer 2\nDonec viverra sapien vel dui vulputate, non bibendum lectus pellentesque. Sed quis ipsum quis mauris hendrerit efficitur. Aliquam erat volutpat. Morbi commodo ante a turpis feugiat et lacinia odio congue.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(questions_answers)\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```julia\nDict(\"Question 1\" => \"This is the question for Q1.\",\n     \"Question 2\" => \"What is the answer for Q2?\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[404,711],"elapsed":31.29240125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
