[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and special instructions, here's how you can solve it using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question: \")\n            push!(questions, String[line[length([\"Question: \",])+1:end]])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer: \")\n            push!(answers, String[line[length([\"Answer: \",])+1:end)])\n        end\n    end\n\n    length(questions) == length(answers || throw(\"Mismatched number of questions and answers\"))\n\n    return (map(strip, questions), map(strip, answers))\nend\n\nfunction strip(str::AbstractString)\n    str = replace(str, r\"^[\\s\\r\\n]+|[\\s\\r\\n]+$\" , \"\")\n    return str\nend\n```\n\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown text as a string and returns a tuple of extracted question-answer pairs. The function first splits the input markdown string into lines, then iterates through each line to identify questions and answers. Questions are assumed to start with \"# Question:\" while answers begin with \"# Answer: \". Once both a question and answer have been found in sequence, they're added to separate arrays `questions` and `answers`. A check is performed to ensure that there is an equal number of questions and answers before returning the tuple.\n\nThe `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces and newlines from extracted strings to maintain proper formatting in the output.","status":200,"tokens":[404,410],"elapsed":18.667515667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
