Think through my approach step by step:\n   a. Parse the markdown text to find sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\".\n   b. Extract the question and answer text from each section.\n   c. Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted texts.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\n```julia\nfunction parse_md(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    parsed = Dict()\n    question_index = -1\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_index = indexof(lines, line) + 1\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if question_index != -1 && startswith(lines[question_index], \"# Answer\")\n            answer_start_index = question_index + 1\n            parsed[\"question\"] = join(lines[question_index+1:answer_start_index-1], \"\\n\") * \" \"\n            parsed[\"answer\"] = join(lines[answer_start_index+1:end]) * \" \"\n            break\n        end\n    end\n\n    parsed\nend\n\nfunction startswith(str, sub::AbstractString)\n    length(sub) <= length(str) && str[1:length(sub)] == sub\nend\n```\n\n3.
