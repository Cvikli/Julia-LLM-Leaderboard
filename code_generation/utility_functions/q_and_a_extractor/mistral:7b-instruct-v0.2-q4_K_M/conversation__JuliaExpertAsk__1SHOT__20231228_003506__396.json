It processes each line of the input text, looking for lines that start with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". When a question is found, it is added to an array of questions. If an answer follows a question (i.e., a line starting with \"# Answer\"), the previous answers are concatenated and added to an array of answers along with the new answer. Finally, the function handles the last question-answer pair by extracting them from the arrays and returning them in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[139,501],"elapsed":20.4587855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
