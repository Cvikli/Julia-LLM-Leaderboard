It extracts the questions and answers as separate strings, strips any leading spaces and newlines, and stores them as tuples in a list called `qas`. Finally, it returns this list of question-answer tuples when the function is called.","status":200,"tokens":[98,469],"elapsed":18.935967625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
