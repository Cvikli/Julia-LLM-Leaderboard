[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Regular expressions (to extract lines starting with \"Question\" or \"Answer\")\n   - String manipulation (to strip leading spaces and newlines)\n   - Tuple data structure (to store question and answer)\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # Split input markdown string into individual lines\n    questions = [line for line in lines if startswith(line, r\"^# Question\\s*\")] # Extract lines starting with 'Question'\n    answers = [line for line in lines if startswith(line, r\"^# Answer\\s*\")]  # Extract lines starting with 'Answer'\n\n    isempty(questions) || deleteat!(lines, findfirst(x -> x == questions[1], lines)) # Remove first question line\n    isempty(answers) || deleteat!(lines, findfirst(x -> x == answers[1], lines)+1)   # Remove next line after answer line\n\n    question = join(questions, \"\\n\").trim()\n    answer = join(answers, \"\\n\").trim()\n\n    (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function extracts all lines in a markdown string starting with \"Question\" and \"Answer\" respectively, then trims any leading spaces and newlines from these strings before returning them as a tuple. This should correctly extract the question and answer sections from the provided markdown-formatted text.","status":200,"tokens":[406,410],"elapsed":18.667104417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
