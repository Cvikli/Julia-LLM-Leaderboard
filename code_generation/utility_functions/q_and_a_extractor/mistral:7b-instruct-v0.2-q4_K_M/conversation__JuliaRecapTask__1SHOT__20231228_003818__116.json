[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and special instructions, here's a Julia solution for the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nusing String: rfind, match\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\") # Split markdown text into lines\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    \n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question:\") # Check if line starts with \"Question:\"\n            question = String(line[14:end]) # Extract question text without leading text\n            questions += [question]\n            \n            # Find the answer index based on the question index\n            answer_start = findnext(x -> startswith(x, \"# Answer:\"), lines[i+1:]), 1)[1] + i\n            answers += lines[(i+1):(answer_start-1)] # Extract all lines between Question and Answer\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    length(questions) == length(answers || throw(\"Invalid markdown format\")) && return(questions, answers)\n    throw(\"Could not find a question and answer pair in the provided markdown text\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function, `q_and_a_extractor`, accepts an abstract string containing markdown-formatted text. It first splits the text into lines using newlines as delimiters. Then, it iterates through each line looking for a question line that starts with \"# Question:\". Once a question line is found, its corresponding answer lines are extracted based on the position of the following answer line starting with \"# Answer:\". The function returns both the question and answer text as a tuple while stripping any leading spaces and newlines.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that there's only one question-answer pair in each markdown text, but it can be easily extended to handle multiple pairs by maintaining an array of extracted questions and answers and adjusting the loop exit condition accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[404,457],"elapsed":20.586727083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
