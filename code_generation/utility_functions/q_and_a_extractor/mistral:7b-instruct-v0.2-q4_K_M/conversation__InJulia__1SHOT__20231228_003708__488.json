Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use regular expressions to extract the question and answer sections from a given markdown-formatted text `md`. Here's how you can write the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question: \")\n            push!(questions, String(line[13:end]))\n        elseif isnothing(findfirst(x -> startswith(x, \"# Answer: \"), lines[i+1:end])) && !isempty(questions)\n            answer_index = i\n            push!(answers, String[lines[answer_index+1:end]...])\n            clear!(questions)\n        end\n    end\n\n    length(questions) == 0 || throw(ArgumentError(\"Not enough questions and answers found in the given markdown text.\"))\n\n    return (questions[end], join(answers, \"\\n\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis function `q_and_a_extractor` accepts a single argument of type `AbstractString` representing the markdown-formatted text. It processes each line in the text to find the question and answer sections. Once a question is found, it saves its index along with the subsequent lines until the next question or the end of the text is reached. The extracted questions and answers are then returned as a tuple containing two strings: `(question,answer)`.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there's only one answer section for each question. If there's more than one answer, you would need to modify the function accordingly to handle multiple answer sections.","status":200,"tokens":[98,411],"elapsed":16.616548167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
