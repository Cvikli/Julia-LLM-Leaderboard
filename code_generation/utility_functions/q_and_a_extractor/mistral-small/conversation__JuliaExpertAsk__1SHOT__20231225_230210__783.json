It then checks each section to see if it starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, and if so, strips any leading spaces and newlines from the text that follows and stores it as the `question` or `answer`, respectively. Finally, it returns the extracted `question` and `answer` as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[141,233],"elapsed":3.3236255,"_type":"aimessage"}]
