If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets the `question` variable to an empty string. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets the `answer` variable to an empty string. If a line doesn't start with either of those strings, but `question` is not `nothing`, it appends the line (after stripping leading spaces) to the `question` string. Similarly, if `answer` is not `nothing`, it appends the line to the `answer` string. When both `question` and `answer` are non-`nothing`, it appends them to the `questions` and `answers` arrays, respectively, and resets both variables to `nothing`.\n\nAt the end, the function checks that both `questions` and `answers` are non-empty, and returns the first question and answer as a tuple. If either `questions` or `answers` is empty, the function throws an `ErrorException`.","status":200,"tokens":[141,487],"elapsed":6.589565375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
