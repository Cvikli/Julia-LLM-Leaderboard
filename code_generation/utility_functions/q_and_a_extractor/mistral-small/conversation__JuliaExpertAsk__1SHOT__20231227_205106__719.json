[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise. You're precise and answer only when you're confident in the high quality of your answer.","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Question\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should do what you're asking for:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(split(line, \": \")[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(line, \": \")[2])\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\nThe function works by splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating through each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets the `question` variable to the text following the `:`. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets the `answer` variable to the text following the `:`, breaks out of the loop, and returns the `question` and `answer`. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the function:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question: What is the capital of France?\n\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Answer: Paris\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\nOutput:\n```yaml\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[141,349],"elapsed":5.15780225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
