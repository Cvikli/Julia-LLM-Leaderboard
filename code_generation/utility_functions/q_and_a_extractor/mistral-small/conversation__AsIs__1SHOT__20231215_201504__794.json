Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It then finds all sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`, and extracts the text following those headers. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a question and its corresponding answer.\n\nNote that this function assumes that there is always a corresponding answer for each question, and vice versa. If this is not the case, the function will return `None`.","status":200,"tokens":[97,285],"elapsed":3.799748375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
