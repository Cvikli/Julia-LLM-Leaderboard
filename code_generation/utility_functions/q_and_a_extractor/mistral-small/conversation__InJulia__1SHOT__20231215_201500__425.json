[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a possible implementation of the function `q_and_a_extractor` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question: \")\n            push!(questions, strip(line[13:end]))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer: \")\n            push!(answers, strip(line[10:end]))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return Tuple(questions), Tuple(answers)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown text `md` into lines and then checking if each line starts with the string `# Question:` or `# Answer:`. If it does, the function strips the leading spaces and the prefix `# Question:` or `# Answer:` and adds the resulting string to the corresponding array `questions` or `answers`. Finally, the function returns the arrays `questions` and `answers` as tuples.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question: What is the capital of France?\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Question: Who is the president of the United States?\nThe president of the United States is Joe Biden.\n\n# Answer: The capital of France is Paris.\n\n# Question: What is the largest planet in the solar system?\nThe largest planet in the solar system is Jupiter.\n\n# Answer: The president of the United States is Joe Biden.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n\nprintln(\"Questions:\")\nfor question in questions\n    println(\"- \", question)\nend\n\nprintln(\"\\nAnswers:\")\nfor answer in answers\n    println(\"- \", answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```less\nQuestions:\n- What is the capital of France?\n- Who is the president of the United States?\n- What is the largest planet in the solar system?\n\nAnswers:\n- The capital of France is Paris.\n- The president of the United States is Joe Biden.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[100,525],"elapsed":8.6842155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
