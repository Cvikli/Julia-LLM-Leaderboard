Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that should accomplish what you're asking for:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = nothing\n    answer = nothing\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(split(line, \": \")[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(line, \": \")[2])\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    return question, answer\nend\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown text into lines and then iterating over each line. If a line starts with `# Question`, it sets the `question` variable to the text following the `: `. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it sets the `answer` variable to the text following the `: ` and then breaks out of the loop. Finally, it returns the `question` and `answer` variables as a tuple.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that each question and answer is separated by a line that starts with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively. If the markdown text is not well-formed, this function may not work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[141,284],"elapsed":3.795553292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
