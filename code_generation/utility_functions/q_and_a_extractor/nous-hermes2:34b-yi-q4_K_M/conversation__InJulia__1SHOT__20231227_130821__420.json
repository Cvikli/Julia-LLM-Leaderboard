Here's an example implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = filter(Markdown.parse(md)) do md_node\n        isa(md_node, Markdown.HeaderNode) &&\n        md_node.level == 2 &&\n        occursin(\"Question\", md_node.raw)\n    end\n\n    answers = filter(Markdown.parse(md)) do md_node\n        isa(md_node, Markdown.HeaderNode) &&\n        md_node.level == 2 &&\n        occursin(\"Answer\", md_node.raw)\n    end\n\n    if length(questions) < length(answers)\n        error(\"Number of questions and answers do not match!\")\n    elseif length(questions) > length(answers)\n        warn(\"Number of questions exceeds number of answers!\")\n        return (nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    question_texts = map(Markdown.parse, questions[1:length(questions)]) do md_node\n        md_node.content |> strip\n    end\n\n    answer_texts = map(Markdown.parse, answers[1:length(answers)]) do md_node\n        md_node.content |> strip\n    end\n\n    return (question_texts[1], answer_texts[1])\nend\n```\n\nThis function first filters the markdown-formatted text to extract all `Question` and `Answer` sections using regular expressions. It then checks if there are equal numbers of questions and answers. If not, it either throws an error or returns a tuple with `nothing` values for both question and answer (depending on whether there are more questions than answers).\n\nIf the number of questions and answers is equal, the function extracts the text content from each section using `Markdown.parse()` and strips any leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` function. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the first question and answer.","status":200,"tokens":[104,496],"elapsed":84.455399792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
