Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n1. Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Split the markdown text into lines using `split(md, \"\\n\")`\n   - Iterate over each line to find sections starting with 'Question' and 'Answer'\n   - Store the extracted question and answer in a tuple\n2. Write any functions and other code needed:\n   - Define the function `q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}`\n3. Solve the task by implementing the steps above:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n\n    # Initialize variables to store question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each line to find sections starting with 'Question' and 'Answer'\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\\n\")\n            # Store the question from the next lines until a blank or '# Answer' is found\n            question = strip(join([lines[j] for j in i+1:findnext(r\"\\A# [A-Za-z]+\"i, lines)[1]], \"\\n\"))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\\n\")\n            # Store the answer from the next lines until a blank or '# Question' is found\n            answer = strip(join([lines[j] for j in i+1:findprev(r\"\\A# [A-Za-z]+\"i, lines)[2]], \"\\n\"))\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct by calling the function with the given data:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nNote: This solution assumes that there will only be one question and answer pair per markdown text. If multiple pairs are expected, modifications may need to be made to handle them accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[244,540],"elapsed":107.177372791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
