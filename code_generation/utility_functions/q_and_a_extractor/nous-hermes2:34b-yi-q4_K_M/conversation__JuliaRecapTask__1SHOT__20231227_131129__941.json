[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It extracts the question and answer texts from these sections, stripping any leading spaces or newlines before them. If a question is found without an accompanying answer, the loop breaks to prevent empty tuples being returned. Finally, it returns a tuple containing all valid question-answer pairs found in the markdown text.\n\nTo use this function with your input:\n```julia\nmd_text = \"# Question 1\\n How does Julia handle multiple dispatch?\\n# Answer 1\\nJulia has special syntax for defining methods that can be called on any number of types. For example, the `map` function takes a function and an array as arguments, but it is overloaded to work with different types of arrays such as integers or strings. This allows you to write code in Julia without worrying about whether your functions are compatible with all possible input types.\"\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)  # Call the function with the markdown text\nprintln(q_and_a)  # Print out the result\n```","status":200,"tokens":[415,639],"elapsed":119.688925917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
