Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the following code to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`).\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line) && !occursin(\"##\", line) # Skip nested questions\n            line = replace(strip(line), \"\\n\" => \"\")\n            question = split(line, ':', keepempty=false)[end]\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line) && !occursin(\"##\", line) # Skip nested answers\n            line = replace(strip(line), \"\\n\" => \"\")\n            answer = split(line, ':', keepempty=false)[end]\n        elseif occursin(\"#\", line) && !occursin(\"##\", line) # Skip all other headings\n            continue\n        else\n            question *= \"\\n$(strip(line))\"\n            answer *= \"\\n$(strip(line))\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a tuple with the question and answer extracted from the `md` text. It first initializes two empty strings for storing the question and answer respectively. Then it iterates through each line in the markdown text. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\" (ignoring nested headings), it extracts that particular section and stores it in the respective variable. If a line doesn't start with either of these headings, it appends the cleaned line to both the question and answer strings. The final result is then returned as a tuple containing the question and answer text.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the markdown text contains only one question and one answer. If you have multiple questions and answers in your markdown, please modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[104,460],"elapsed":78.481245459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
