Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Split the markdown-formatted text into lines using `split(md, '\\n')`.\n2. Iterate through each line to find a question and answer section.\n3. If a line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, create an empty string (`\"\"`) to store the text of that section.\n4. Continue reading lines until you encounter the next question or answer heading.\n5. Strip leading spaces from each line using `strip(line)` and append it to the current section's text.\n6. Once all lines for a question/answer section have been processed, store the final text as either `question` or `answer` in a tuple.\n7. Continue until all lines are processed.\n8.
