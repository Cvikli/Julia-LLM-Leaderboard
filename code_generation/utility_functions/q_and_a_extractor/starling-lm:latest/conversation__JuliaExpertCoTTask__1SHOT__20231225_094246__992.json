First, we need to identify the sections of the text that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. We can use regular expressions to find these sections in the given markdown-formatted text. \n2. Once we have identified the sections, we need to extract the text from each section, removing any leading spaces and newlines. We can use string manipulation methods like `strip()` for this purpose. \n3. After extracting the question and answer texts, we can return them as a tuple. \n\nHere's the code that implements these steps:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"(\\# Question.*?)(?=(\\n\\n))\" # Pattern to find question section\n    question = match(pattern, md).match[1].strip().split(\"\\n\")[2:end] |> String\n    \n    pattern = r\"(\\# Answer.*?)(?=(\\n\\n))\" # Pattern to find answer section\n    answer = match(pattern, md).match[1].strip().split(\"\\n\")[2:end] |> String\n    (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nNow we can test our function with the given data:\n\n```julia\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")\n```\n\nThis code will return a tuple `(question, answer)` where `question` and `answer` are the stripped texts from the markdown sections `Question` and `Answer`, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[249,382],"elapsed":12.778599125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
