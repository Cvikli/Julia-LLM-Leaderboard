Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a possible implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = parse(String, replace(substrings(md, \"# Question\"), \" \\\\* \" => \"\"))\n    answer = parse(String, replace(substrings(md, \"# Answer\"), \" \\\\* \" => \"\"))\n    (question, answer)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `parse(String, str)` converts the input string to a Julia string.\n* `replace(str, pat => repl)` replaces all occurrences of the pattern `pat` in the input string with the replacement `repl`. In this case, we're replacing the `# Question` and `# Answer` tags with an empty string, so that they're not included in the extracted text.\n* `substrings(str, pat => repl)` returns a list of all occurrences of the pattern `pat` in the input string, along with their positions. We're using this function to extract the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections separately.\n* The `(question, answer)` tuple returns the extracted text in the format requested.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown text is already properly formatted (i.e., there are no extra spaces or newlines within the `# Question` and `# Answer` tags). If your input text has these issues, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[128,320],"elapsed":11.282849,"_type":"aimessage"}]
