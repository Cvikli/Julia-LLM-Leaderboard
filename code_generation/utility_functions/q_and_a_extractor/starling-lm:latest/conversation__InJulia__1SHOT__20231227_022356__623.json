It first splits the input text into lines, then iterates over each line to identify whether it is part of the question or answer section based on the markdown headings \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". The function appends the trimmed lines to the `question` and `answer` variables as they are encountered. Finally, it returns a tuple of the stripped question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[107,313],"elapsed":9.9457,"_type":"aimessage"}]
