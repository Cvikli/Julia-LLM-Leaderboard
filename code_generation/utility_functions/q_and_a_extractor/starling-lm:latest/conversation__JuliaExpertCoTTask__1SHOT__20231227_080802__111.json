Define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes the markdown-formatted text `md` as an argument.\n2. Split the `md` into lines using the `split` method and store them in a variable called `lines`.\n3. Initialize two empty lists: `questions` to store all questions, and `answers` to store all answers.\n4. Iterate over each line in the `lines` variable. If a line starts with `\"# Question\"` (ignoring leading spaces), append the line without leading spaces or newline characters to the `questions` list. Similarly, if a line starts with `\"# Answer\"`, append it to the `answers` list without leading spaces or newline characters.\n5. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple using the `return` statement.\n6. Test the function with the given example data in the main block of code. Print the result of calling the function with the provided `md` string to verify if the solution is correct.\n\nHere's how the Python code would look like:\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    lines = md.split(\"\\n\")\n    questions, answers = [], []\n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith(\"# Question\"):\n            questions.append(line[8:].strip())\n        elif line.startswith(\"# Answer\"):\n            answers.append(line[7:].strip())\n    return tuple(questions), tuple(answers)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    md = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\n    print(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Expected output: ('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```\n\nThis code will correctly extract questions and answers from the markdown-formatted text, returning them as a tuple of strings.","status":200,"tokens":[249,468],"elapsed":20.758469042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
