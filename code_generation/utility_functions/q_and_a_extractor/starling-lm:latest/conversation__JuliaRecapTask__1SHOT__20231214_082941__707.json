[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Let's start solving the task using the systematic approach.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* `split()` function to split a string into an array based on a delimiter\n\t* `strip()` function to remove leading and trailing spaces from a string\n\t* `parse()` function to parse a Markdown string into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)\n\t* `get markdown_tokens()` function from the `Markdown` package to extract the markdown sections\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Write a function `q_and_a_extractor(md::String)` that takes a Markdown string as input and returns a tuple like `(question, answer)`, where `question` is the extracted text from the `# Question` section, and `answer` is the extracted text from the `# Answer` section.\n\t* Use the `split()` function to split the input Markdown string into an array based on the `#` character, which separates the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n\t* Use the `strip()` function to remove leading and trailing spaces from each element in the array.\n\t* Use the `parse()` function to parse each element in the array into an AST.\n\t* Use the `get markdown_tokens()` function from the `Markdown` package to extract the markdown sections from the ASTs.\n\t* Extract the text from the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections by filtering the markdown tokens with a function that checks if the token is either a `# Question` or a `# Answer`.\n\t* Return the extracted text in a tuple like `(question, answer)`, where `question` is the text from the `# Question` section, and `answer` is the text from the `# Answer` section.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with different Markdown inputs to ensure that it correctly extracts the text from the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections.\n\t* Use a debugging tool such as `println()` or `show()` to inspect the internal state of the function and ensure that it behaves as expected.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the input Markdown string into an array based on the `#` character\n    tokens = split(md, \"#\")\n    \n    # Remove leading and trailing spaces from each token\n    tokens = map(token -> strip(token), tokens)\n    \n    # Parse each token into an AST\n    asts = parse(tokens)\n    \n    # Extract the markdown sections from the ASTs\n    markdown_tokens = getmarkdowntokens(ast)\n    \n    # Filter the markdown tokens to extract the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for token in markdown_tokens\n        if token.type == \"Question\"\n            question = token.text\n        elseif token.type == \"Answer\"\n            answer = token.text\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the extracted text in a tuple like `(question, answer)`\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections are the only markdown sections present in the input Markdown string. If your task requires extraction of other markdown sections, please modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[399,784],"elapsed":33.693320708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
