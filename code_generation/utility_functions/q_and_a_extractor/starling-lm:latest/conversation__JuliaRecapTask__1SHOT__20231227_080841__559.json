[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

It concatenates all lines within a section while discarding leading spaces and newlines.\n\nHere are some examples of usage with different inputs:\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question: Here's some text in the question.\\n\\n# Answer: And here's some text in the answer.\"\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: $q\") # Question: Here's some text in the question.\nprintln(\"Answer: $a\")   # Answer: And here's some text in the answer.\n```\nThis function should work correctly with any markdown-formatted string, as long as the questions and answers follow the specified format (i.e., starting with `# Question:` and `# Answer:`).","status":200,"tokens":[413,370],"elapsed":13.514580042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
