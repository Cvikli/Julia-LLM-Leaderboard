The function first splits the input string into an array of lines, then iterates through the lines to find the question and answer sections. It uses the functions `strip` and `split` to remove any leading spaces or newlines from the text.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes there is only one set of question-answer pairs in the given markdown text, and does not handle cases where there are multiple sets or no question/answer pairs at all.","status":200,"tokens":[148,378],"elapsed":12.012868416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
