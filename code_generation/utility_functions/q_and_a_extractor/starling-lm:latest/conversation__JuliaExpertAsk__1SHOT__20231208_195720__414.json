The function loops through each line of the input markdown, extracting the question and answer sections based on their distinct markers (`# Question` and `# Answer`), and then joining all the lines within each section with commas using `strip` to remove any leading spaces or newlines","status":200,"tokens":[159,457],"elapsed":15.441755375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
