It also strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    pattern = r\"^# Question(?:\\s+.*?)*?(?=\\n)^# Answer(?:\\s+.*?)*$\"\n    matches = findall(pattern, md, overlap=true, occursin=true)\n    \n    if length(matches) == 0\n        error(\"No valid Q&A section found in the markdown\")\n    end\n    \n    questions_answers = Dict{String, Tuple{String, String}}()\n    for match in matches\n        question_match = findall(r\"^# Question(?:\\s+.*?)*?(?=\\n)\", md[match:end], overlap=true, occursin=true)\n        answer_match = findall(r\"^# Answer(?:\\s+.*?)*$\", md[match:end], overlap=true, occursin=true)\n        \n        if length(question_match) != 1 || length(answer_match) != 1\n            error(\"Invalid Q&A section format\")\n        end\n        \n        question = strip(md[begin(question_match[1]):end(question_match[1])])\n        answer = strip(md[begin(answer_match[1]):end(answer_match[1])])\n        questions_answers[lowercase(question)] = (strip(question), strip(answer))\n    end\n    \n    return NamedTuple{(\"question\", \"answer\")}(questions_answers)\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is a sample question with some leading spaces and a trailing newline. It should be removed during processing. What is the purpose of this exercise?\n\n# Answer\nTo demonstrate extraction of Q&A sections from markdown text, while ensuring that invalid sections are detected and errors are raised appropriately.\n\"\"\"\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # ((\"what is the purpose of this exercise?\", \"To demonstrate extraction of Q&A sections from markdown text, while ensuring that invalid sections are detected and errors are raised appropriately.\"))\n```\n\nThis function will process a markdown document with valid Q&A sections and return the extracted questions and answers as a named tuple. It also handles scenarios where there are no valid Q&A sections or if the format of the sections is incorrect, raising appropriate errors in these cases.\n\nPlease note that this function does not handle any edge cases, such as nested Q&A sections, invalid markdown syntax, etc., and it may need to be extended based on specific requirements.\n\nAdditionally, please ensure you have a version of Julia that supports NamedTuples before running the provided code. Here's an example of how to use the function with a Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):\n```julia\njulia> using Printf\n\njulia> function q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n           pattern = r\"^# Question(?:\\s+.*?)*?(?=\\n)^# Answer(?:\\s+.*?)*$\"\n           matches = findall(pattern, md, overlap=true, occursin=true)\n           \n           if length(matches) == 0\n               error(\"No valid Q&A section found in the markdown\")\n           end\n           \n           questions_answers = Dict{String, Tuple{String, String}}()\n           for match in matches\n               question_match = findall(r\"^# Question(?:\\s+.*?)*?(?=\\n)\", md[match:end], overlap=true, occursin=true)\n               answer_match = findall(r\"^# Answer(?:\\s+.*?)*$\", md[match:end], overlap=true, occursin=true)\n              \n               if length(question_match) != 1 || length(answer_match) != 1\n                   error(\"Invalid Q&A section format\")\n               end\n              \n               question = strip(md[begin(question_match[1]):end(question_match[1])])\n               answer = strip(md[begin(answer_match[1]):end(answer_match[1])])\n               questions_answers[lowercase(question)] = (strip(question), strip(answer))\n           end\n           \n           return NamedTuple{(\"question\", \"answer\")}(questions_answers)\n       end\n```\nThis code snippet shows how to define and use the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia's REPL.\n\nTo run the provided example with a REPL, you can paste the function definition and example usage into a Julia session and execute them using the \"eval\" command, like this:\n```julia\njulia> eval(parse(\"function q_and_a_extractor(md::String) ... end\"))\n\njulia> md = \"\"\"...\"\"\"  # paste the markdown content here\n\njulia> result = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThis will define the function and execute the example usage with the provided markdown content.\n\nRemember to replace the ellipsis (...) with the actual function definition and markdown content, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[146,1277],"elapsed":44.7013475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
