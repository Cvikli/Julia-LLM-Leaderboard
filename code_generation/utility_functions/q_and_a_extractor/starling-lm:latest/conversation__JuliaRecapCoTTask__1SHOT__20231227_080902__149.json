[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

If it is, the function extracts the text in that section until it's no longer in that section (i.e., when the next line doesn't start with '# Q' or '# A'). It then returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nTo test this function, you can provide a sample markdown-formatted text:\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question How do you define Julia language programmer?\\n# Answer A world-class Julia language programmer is one who has a very systematic approach to problem solving and follows the guidelines provided by the Julia Language community.\\nThis is an example of a question and answer.\"\n```\nAnd then call the `q_and_a_extractor` function with this `md` string:\n```julia\n(question, answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\nThe output will be the extracted question and answer as a tuple `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[415,589],"elapsed":20.72690275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
