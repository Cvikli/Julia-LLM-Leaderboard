It then strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text before returning the answer in a tuple. \n\nTo use this function, you can define a markdown-formatted string like:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\n What is the capital of France?\n# Answer\n Paris.\n\"\"\"\n```\nThen, call the `q_and_a_extractor` function with this string to get the answer in a tuple:\n```julia\n(question,answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(question) # prints \"What is the capital of France?\"\nprintln(answer)   # prints \"Paris.\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[107,360],"elapsed":11.328728208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
