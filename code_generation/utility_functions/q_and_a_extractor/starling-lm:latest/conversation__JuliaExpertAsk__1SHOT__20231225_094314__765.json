Here's some more context to make it longer.\n\n# Answer\nThis is the corresponding answer, also a bit long to fill up the space and make it look authentic. It's important to have a sufficiently long text for testing purposes.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(result)  # Output: (\"This is a sample question. Here's some more context to make it longer.\" => \"This is the corresponding answer, also a bit long to fill up the space and make it look authentic. It's important to have a sufficiently long text for testing purposes.\")\n```\n\nThe function splits the input string `md` into lines using the newline character as the delimiter. It then iterates over the lines until it finds a line starting with `# Question`. After that, it joins all subsequent non-empty lines to form the question text and strips any leading spaces or newlines from it. The same process is applied for finding the answer section.\n\nFinally, the function returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[148,488],"elapsed":15.459019917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
