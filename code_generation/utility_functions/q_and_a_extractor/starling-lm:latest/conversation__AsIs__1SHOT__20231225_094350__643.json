If it does, it extracts the subsequent lines until it finds the next section header, stripping any leading spaces and newlines. The extracted question and answer are stored in variables, which are then returned as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[104,440],"elapsed":13.747653625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
