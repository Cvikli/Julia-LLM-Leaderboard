The function iterates over each line in the input string, strips any leading spaces and newlines, and checks if the line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, the function appends the stripped content to the respective `question` or `answer` variable until it encounters another markdown section.","status":200,"tokens":[107,413],"elapsed":13.054013292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
