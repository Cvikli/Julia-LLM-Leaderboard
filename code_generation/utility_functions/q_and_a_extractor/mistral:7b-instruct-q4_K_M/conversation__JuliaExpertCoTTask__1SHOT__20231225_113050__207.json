First, we need to identify the markdown sections Question and Answer in the input text `md`. We can do this by searching for lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively.\n2. Next, we extract the text following these lines using regular expressions. We use the `r\"^(?!\\w).*\"` pattern to match any non-word character (including spaces and newlines) until the end of the line. This ensures that we capture all text within each markdown section.\n3. Finally, we remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using the `strip()` function.\n4. We return a tuple containing the question and answer texts as extracted from the input markdown.\n\nHere's the code implementing this solution:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    match = re.search(r\"# Question(.*?)\\n# Answer(.*?)\", md, re.DOTALL)\n    if match:\n        question, answer = match.groups()\n        return (question.strip(), answer.strip())\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Markdown does not contain a Question and Answer section\")\n```\n\n### Example usage:\n```python\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # Output: ('What is the capital of France?', 'The capital of France is Paris.')\n```","status":200,"tokens":[241,348],"elapsed":14.881311917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
