The `split()` function splits the input string into lines using the newline character as a delimiter. Then, it iterates over the lines to find the Question and Answer sections. If it finds a line starting with \"# Question\", it stores the next line (which contains the text in the Question section) in the `question` variable. If it finds a line starting with \"# Answer\" after that, it stores the next line in the `answer` variable and breaks out of the loop. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the trimmed question and answer texts.","status":200,"tokens":[99,277],"elapsed":11.298552875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
