Here's an example of how I might write the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Use the Markdown.jl library to parse the markdown text\n    doc = Markdown.parse(md)\n\n    # Extract the Question and Answer sections\n    question = getmarkdowntext(doc, \"# Question\")\n    answer = getmarkdowntext(doc, \"# Answer\")\n\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nNote that I'm using the `getmarkdowntext` function from the Markdown.jl library to extract the text of the Question and Answer sections. This function takes a Markdown document as input and returns the text of the given section.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[128,222],"elapsed":7.991295625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
