Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task.\n2. Solve the task.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct.\n\nFirst, let's recall some useful Julia snippets:\n\n- For reading a file and splitting by lines: `read(`filename.md`, Data::Vector{String})`\n- For iterating over a vector of strings: `for line in data`\n- For checking if a line starts with a specific prefix: `if line[1] == \"#\"`\n- For extracting the text between the specified sections: `question = \"\", answer = \"\"`\n\nNow, let's write the function `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(filename::String)\n    # Read the file and split by lines\n    data = read(filename, Data::Vector{String})\n    \n    # Iterate over the lines and check if they start with \"#\"\n    for line in data\n        if line[1] == \"#\"\n            # Check if the line is a question or an answer\n            if line == \"# Question\"\n                # Extract the text after the prefix\n                question = strip(line[7:end])\n            elseif line == \"# Answer\"\n                # Extract the text after the prefix\n                answer = strip(line[8:end])\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the answer in a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nFinally, let's double-check that the solution is correct by testing it with a sample markdown file:\n\n```julia\n# Testing the function\nfilename = \"q_and_a.md\" # A sample file with two sections\nanswer = q_and_a_extractor(filename)\n\n# Printing the result\nprintln(answer)\n```\n\nThis should print:\n\n```\n(\"What is the main syntax of Julia programming language?\", \"Key Syntax: variables x = 10, control structures if-elseif-else, isX ?
