I can help you write a function to extract question and answer from markdown text in Julia. Here is an example of how to do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::Markdown.Document)\n  # Initialize an empty list to store the questions and answers\n  qas = []\n\n  # Loop through each section in the markdown document\n  for sect in md.sections\n    # Check if the section is a question or an answer\n    if startswith(string(sect), \"# Question\")\n      # Get the text of the question by removing the leading spaces and newlines\n      q = string(sect)[1:end-1]\n      # Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the question text\n      q = strip(q)\n      # Append the question to the list of questions and answers\n      push!(qas, (q, nothing))\n    elseif startswith(string(sect), \"# Answer\")\n      # Get the text of the answer by removing the leading spaces and newlines\n      a = string(sect)[1:end-1]\n      # Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the answer text\n      a = strip(a)\n      # Append the answer to the list of questions and answers\n      push!(qas, (nothing, a))\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Return the list of questions and answers as a tuple\n  return qas\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a markdown document as an argument and returns a tuple of tuples containing the questions and answers. Each tuple contains the text of the question or answer and an empty value for the other part. For example, if the markdown document is:\n\n```markdown\n# Question: What is the name of the AI assistant?\n## Answer: The name of the AI assistant is Julia.\n```\n\nThen the function will return:\n\n```julia\n((\"What is the name of the AI assistant?\", nothing), (\"The name of the AI assistant is Julia.\", \"\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[102,469],"elapsed":26.685778667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
