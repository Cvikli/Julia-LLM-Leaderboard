X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Based on the problem statement and special instructions provided, here are the steps I will follow to solve the task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* `markdown` package for parsing markdown text\n\t* `String` and `Regex` modules for manipulating strings and matching patterns\n\t* `Iterators` module for working with iterable data structures\n\t* `Map` and `Reduce` functions for applying a function to each element in an iterable\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Use the `markdown` package to parse the input markdown text into a `Markdown` object\n\t* Use regular expressions to extract the Question and Answer sections of the Markdown text\n\t* Use the `Iterators` module to iterate over the extracted Question and Answer sections\n\t* Use the `Map` and `Reduce` functions to strip leading spaces and newlines from each section\n\t* Return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Use the `println` function to print out the extracted Question and Answer sections to verify that they are correct\n\nHere's the complete code for the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\nusing String\nusing Regex\nusing Iterators\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Parse the input markdown text into a Markdown object\n    m = Markdown(md)\n    \n    # Extract the Question and Answer sections using regular expressions\n    q_re = Regex(\"## Question\")\n    answer_re = Regex(\"## Answer\")\n    q = String[q_re.match(m).captures[\"Question\"]];\n    a = String[answer_re.match(m).captures[\"Answer\"]];\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text\n    q = strip(q)\n    a = strip(a)\n    \n    # Return the answer in a tuple like (question, answer)\n    return (q, a)\nend\n\n# Test the function with some sample input\nprintln(\"Input:\")\nprintln(md_text)\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\nIn this code, we first import the `Markdown`, `String`, `Regex`, `Iterators` modules that we will use for parsing markdown text and extracting Question and Answer sections. We then define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a string input `md` as input, parses it using the `Markdown` package, extracts the Question and Answer sections using regular expressions, strips leading spaces and newlines from each section, and returns the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.\n\nFinally, we provide some sample input `md_text` and call the function to demonstrate its usage.\n\nI hope this helps!
