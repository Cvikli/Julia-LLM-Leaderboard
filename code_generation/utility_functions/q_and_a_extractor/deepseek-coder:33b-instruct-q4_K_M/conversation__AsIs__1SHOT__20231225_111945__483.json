[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can do this by first splitting the markdown string on each `# Question` and `# Answer`, then iterating over those chunks to extract the questions and answers.\n\n```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    chunks = md.split('# Question')[1:] # split on '# Question'\n    \n    result = []\n    for chunk in chunks:\n        question, answer = chunk.split('# Answer', 1) # split on the first '# Answer'\n        \n        # strip leading and trailing spaces/newlines\n        question = question.strip()\n        answer = answer.strip()\n        \n        result.append((question,answer))\n    \n    return result\n```\nYou can call the function with a markdown string as follows:\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"# Question 1\nThis is question 1\n# Answer 1\nThis is the answer for question 1\n# Question 2\nThis is question 2\n# Answer 2\nThis is the answer for question 2\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\nThe output will be:\n`[('This is question 1', 'This is the answer for question 1'), ('This is question 2', 'This is the answer for question 2')]`\n\nNote that this function assumes that each Question-Answer pair appears in the markdown text exactly once, and there are no other `# Question` or `# Answer` substrings appearing elsewhere. If these assumptions aren't true, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[104,360],"elapsed":61.55054725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
