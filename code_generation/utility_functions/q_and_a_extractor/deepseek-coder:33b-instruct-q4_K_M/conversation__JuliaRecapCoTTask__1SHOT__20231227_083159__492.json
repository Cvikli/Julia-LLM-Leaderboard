[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    q = \"\"\n    a = \"\"\n    inQ, inA = false, false\n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQ = true\n            inA = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inQ = false\n            inA = true\n            continue\n        end\n\n        if inQ\n            q *= line * \" \"\n        elseif inA\n            a *= line * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    return strip(q), strip(a)\nend\n```\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes as input a string `md` and initializes two strings, `q` for the question section and `a` for the answer section. It also maintains two boolean flags `inQ` and `inA` to track which section we are currently in.\n\nThe function then splits the markdown text into lines using the newline character as a delimiter. For each line, if the line starts with \"# Question\", it sets `inQ` to true, resets `a` string and continues to next line. If the line starts with \"# Answer\", it sets `inA` to true, resets `q` string and continues to next line.\n\nIf neither of these cases is encountered, it checks if we are in question section (i.e., `inQ` is true), appends that line to `q` along with a space, or else appends the line to `a` along with a space. At the end, it returns the stripped version of `q` and `a` as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[436,398],"elapsed":76.514649084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
