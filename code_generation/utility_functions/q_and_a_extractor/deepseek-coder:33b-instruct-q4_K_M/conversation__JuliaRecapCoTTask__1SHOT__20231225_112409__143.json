[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Python, you can use the `re` module to handle regular expressions and extract the sections from markdown text. Here's a function that does this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = None\n    answer = None\n    \n    lines = md.split('\\n')\n    \n    for line in lines:\n        if line.startswith('# Question'):\n            question = ''\n        elif line.startswith('# Answer'):\n            answer = ''\n        else:\n            if question is not None:\n                question += ' ' + line.strip()\n            elif answer is not None:\n                answer += ' ' + line.strip()\n    \n    return (question.strip(), answer.strip())\n```\n\nThis function first splits the markdown text into lines, then iterates over each line. When it encounters a line starting with '# Question', it starts collecting text in `question` until it encounters another line starting with '# Answer' or '# Question'. Similarly, when it encounters a line starting with '# Answer', it collects text in `answer`.\n\nThe strip() method is used to remove leading and trailing spaces from the extracted question and answer strings. The resulting tuple is then returned by the function. \n\nNote that this assumes that each Question block and Answer block are separated by a blank line or by other lines of text not starting with '#'. If your markdown text may have different formatting, you might need to modify this code to correctly handle it. For example, if questions and answers could span multiple lines without being separated by a blank line, the code would need to be adjusted accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[436,375],"elapsed":72.65607675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
