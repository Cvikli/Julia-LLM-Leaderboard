Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```python\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    md_lines = md.split(\"\\n\")\n    question, answer = [], []\n    capture_question, capture_answer = False, False\n    \n    for line in md_lines:\n        if \"# Question\" in line:\n            capture_question = True\n            continue\n        \n        elif \"# Answer\" in line:\n            capture_answer = True\n            capture_question = False\n            continue\n            \n        if capture_question:\n            question.append(line)\n        elif capture_answer:\n            answer.append(line)\n    \n    return (\" \".join(question).strip(), \" \".join(answer).strip())\n```\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` first splits the markdown text into lines and initializes two empty lists, `question` and `answer`, to store the text in the Question and Answer sections respectively. \n\nIt then iterates through each line in the split markdown text. If a line contains \"# Question\", it sets a flag `capture_question` to True and skips to the next iteration. If a line contains \"# Answer\", it sets both `capture_answer` and `capture_question` to True, unsetting `capture_question`.\n\nIf `capture_question` is True, the function appends the current line (excluding newline characters) to the `question` list. If `capture_answer` is True, it appends the current line to the `answer` list. \n\nFinally, it returns a tuple of joined lists and removes any leading or trailing white spaces using the strip() function.","status":200,"tokens":[250,377],"elapsed":91.892766333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
