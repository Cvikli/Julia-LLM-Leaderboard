Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Then it iterates over each line, checking whether the line starts with `'# Question'` or `'# Answer'`. If it does, then it saves that text following the hashtag and colon as either the question or answer, respectively. Finally, it returns a tuple containing both the extracted question and answer. The strip method is not used here because there's no need to remove any specific characters; instead, we just want to make sure that any leading spaces and newlines are removed from the start of each string.","status":200,"tokens":[148,227],"elapsed":39.7092535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
