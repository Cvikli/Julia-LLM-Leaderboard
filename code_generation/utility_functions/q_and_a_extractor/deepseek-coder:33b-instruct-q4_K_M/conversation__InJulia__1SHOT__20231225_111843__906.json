Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `re.DOTALL` flag allows `.` to match newlines. The extracted texts are stripped from leading spaces and newlines, and returned as a list of tuples.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"# Question\n    What is the capital of France?\n    # Answer\n    Paris\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md))  # [('What is the capital of France?', 'Paris')]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[107,283],"elapsed":48.713735042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
