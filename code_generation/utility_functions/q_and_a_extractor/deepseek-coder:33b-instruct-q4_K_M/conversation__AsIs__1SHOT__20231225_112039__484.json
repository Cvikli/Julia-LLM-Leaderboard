It then returns them as a tuple. Any leading spaces or newlines are stripped from both the question and answer before returning them. \n\nPlease note, this function assumes that every `# Question` will have an immediate following line containing the actual question (same for `# Answer`), which is not necessarily the case in the general markdown syntax. It also treats all other lines as either a continuation of a question or answer until it encounters another `# Question` or `# Answer`, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[104,311],"elapsed":54.596840791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
