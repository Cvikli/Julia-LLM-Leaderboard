[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    questions = split(md, \"# Question\")[2:end]\n    answers = split(md, \"# Answer\")[2:end]\n    return map((q, a)->(strip(q), strip(a)), questions, answers)\nend\n```\nThis function uses `split` to divide the markdown text into parts. The first part (before \"# Question\"), is discarded. Then for each subsequent part of the split operation (after \"# Answer\" or \"# Question\") it strips leading and trailing spaces using `strip`, and then pairs them up with `map` function.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no other sections in your markdown text besides \"Question\" and \"Answer\". If you have multiple questions and answers, they will be grouped into one tuple each. Also, it doesn't handle cases where the answer comes before the question. You may want to modify or improve upon this function based on your specific needs.","status":200,"tokens":[434,235],"elapsed":50.566496209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
