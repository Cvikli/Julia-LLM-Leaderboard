[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python function that uses regular expressions to extract the text in Question and Answer sections from a given markdown-formatted string.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Search for Question section\n    match_q = re.search(r'#\\sQuestion\\n(.*?)(?=#\\sAnswer)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    if match_q:\n        question = match_q.group(1).strip()\n    \n    # Search for Answer section\n    match_a = re.search(r'#\\sAnswer\\n(.*)', md, re.DOTALL)\n    if match_a:\n        answer = match_a.group(1).strip()\n        \n    return (question,answer)\n```\nThis function uses the regular expression `re` module in Python to find patterns in the input string. The `search` method is used to search for a pattern in the entire string. The pattern `r'#\\sQuestion\\n(.*?)(?=#\\sAnswer)'` matches any text that starts with \"# Question\", followed by any characters until it reaches \"# Answer\". The \"(?=...)\" construct is a positive lookahead assertion, meaning the match will only occur if there is something after \"# Question\" that matches \"# Answer\".\n\nSimilarly, the pattern `r'#\\sAnswer\\n(.*)'` matches any text that starts with \"# Answer\", followed by any characters until the end of the string. The \"(.*)\" captures all remaining characters into a group which is then returned in the answer tuple. \n\nFinally, the captured text from each section is stripped of leading and trailing spaces using `strip()` before being added to the output tuple. If no match is found for either the Question or Answer sections, an empty string will be returned as part of the tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[434,442],"elapsed":85.516063375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
