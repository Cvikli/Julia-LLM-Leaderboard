[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The code below defines a function `q_and_a_extractor` which accepts the markdown text as input and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains question and its corresponding answer separated by \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\".\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split the md into sections starting with # Question and # Answer\n    sections = split(md, r\"(?=#\\sQuestion|#\\sAnswer)\")\n    \n    # Initialize empty list to hold extracted tuples\n    q_and_a = []\n    \n    for i in 1:2:length(sections)-1\n        # Extract question and answer from the current section and next one\n        question = strip(match(r\"#\\sQuestion:(.*)#\\sAnswer\", sections[i]).captures[1])\n        answer = strip(match(r\"#\\sQuestion:.*\\n?(.*)\", sections[i+1]).captures[1])\n        \n        # Add the extracted tuple to q_and_a list\n        push_to_list = (question, answer)\n        push_to_list != (\"\", \"\") && push_to_list != (nothing, nothing)  ? push_to_list : continue\n    end\n    \n    return q_and_a\nend\n```\nPlease note: this function will work correctly if there is always a \"# Question\" before each \"# Answer\". It also assumes that the answer part of section ends with the next \"# Question\", which may not be true in some markdown files. You may need to modify or improve it based on your specific needs and input formats.","status":200,"tokens":[107,380],"elapsed":63.563968875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
