Think through the approach: We need to extract the Question and Answer sections from the given markdown text, and return them as a tuple.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need: We write the `q_and_a_extractor` function.\n3. Solve the task: We parse the markdown text and extract the Question and Answer sections.\n4. Check that your solution is correct: We ensure that the number of questions and answers match and that they are properly stripped of leading spaces and newlines.\n\nWith the given data, the code will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the capital of France?\nAnswer: The capital of France is Paris\n```","status":200,"tokens":[242,495],"elapsed":9.088881125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
