[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the special instructions provided, here's a solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for i in 1:length(lines)\n        if startswith(lines[i], \"# Question:\")\n            question = lines[i+1:i+findnext(x->!startswith(x, \"#\"), lines[i+1:])-1)\n            push!(questions, strip(question))\n        elseif startswith(lines[i], \"# Answer:\")\n            answer = lines[i+1:end]\n            push!(answers, strip(answer))\n        end\n    end\n\n    length(questions) >= length(answers || throw(ArgumentError(\"Mismatched questions and answers\"))) && return (questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\nThe `q_and_a_extractor` function takes in a string `md` containing markdown text. It splits the string into lines and then iterates through each line. If it encounters a question line (starting with \"# Question:\"), it extracts the question text up to the next answer line. If it encounters an answer line (starting with \"# Answer:\"), it assigns the rest of the lines following it as the answer text. The function keeps track of both the questions and answers in separate arrays and returns them as a tuple when the function completes. If there is a mismatch between the number of questions and answers, it throws an error. The function uses the `startswith` function to check the beginning of lines, `findnext` to find the next non-question line, and `strip` to remove leading and trailing whitespace.\n\nThis solution should work for the given problem statement and special instructions. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[405,436],"elapsed":4.065937667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
