[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It then extracts and stores the corresponding questions and answers in separate lists. Finally, it returns a tuple containing those lists.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a markdown string as its argument, like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is a question.\n\n# Answer 1\nThis is the answer to question 1.\n\n# Question 2\nAnother question.\n\n# Answer 2\nThis is the answer to question 2.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Questions:\")\nprintln(questions)\nprintln(\"Answers:\")\nprintln(answers)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestions:\n[\"Question 1\" \"Question 2\"]\nAnswers:\n[\"This is the answer to question 1.\" \"This is the answer to question 2.\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[407,558],"elapsed":5.191983958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
