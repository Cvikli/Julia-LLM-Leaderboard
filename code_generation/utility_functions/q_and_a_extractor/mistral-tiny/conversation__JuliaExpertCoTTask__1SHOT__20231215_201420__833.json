It first splits the given markdown string into lines, then iterates through the lines to find the questions and answers. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", it extracts the question text. When it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", it extracts the answer text. The function checks that the number of questions and answers match before returning the tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[242,426],"elapsed":5.544896959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
