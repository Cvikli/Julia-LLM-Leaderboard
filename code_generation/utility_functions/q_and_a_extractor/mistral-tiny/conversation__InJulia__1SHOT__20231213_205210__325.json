It returns a tuple of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding question and answer.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how it works:\n\n1. It splits the given markdown text into lines.\n2. It initializes two empty vectors, `questions` and `answers`, to store the extracted questions and answers, respectively.\n3. It iterates through each line of the markdown text. If a line starts with \"# Question:\", it sets the current section to the `questions` vector and pushes the line (without leading spaces and newlines) to the vector. If a line starts with \"# Answer:\", it sets the current section to the `answers` vector and pushes the line (without leading spaces and newlines) to the vector.\n4. After processing all lines, it maps a helper function, `strip`, over every question to remove any leading spaces and newlines, and returns a tuple containing the cleaned question and the original answer.\n\nThe helper functions used in this solution include `startswith`, `strip`, and `split`. These functions are used to check if a string starts with a given prefix, remove leading spaces and newlines, and split a string based on a pattern or regular expression, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[100,637],"elapsed":10.946949875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
