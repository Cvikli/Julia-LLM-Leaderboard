Once it encounters a question line, it keeps collecting lines until it finds the corresponding answer line. Then, it returns a tuple containing all extracted questions and answers.\n\nYou can test the function with the following code:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question: What is the capital city of France?\n# Answer: Paris\n# Question: What is the square root of 144?\n# Answer: 12\n\"\"\"\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Questions: \", questions_and_answers.questions)\nprintln(\"Answers: \", questions_and_answers.answers)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\nQuestions: [\"What is the capital city of France?\" \"What is the square root of 144?\"]\nAnswers: [\"Paris\" \"12\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[100,528],"elapsed":4.7156055,"_type":"aimessage"}]
