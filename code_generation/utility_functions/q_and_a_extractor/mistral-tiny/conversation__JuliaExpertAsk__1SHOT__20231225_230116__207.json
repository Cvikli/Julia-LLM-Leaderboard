The function splits the input markdown text into lines, and uses a stack to keep track of the current question or answer section. When it encounters a new question or answer section, it pushes the current section into the appropriate stack (questions or answers), and then initializes a new empty list for the new section. This way, it maintains the correct pairing of questions and answers. Once all lines have been processed, the function checks if there's an equal number of questions and answers. If not, it throws an error. Finally, it creates a dictionary using `Map` to pair the indexed question vectors with their corresponding answer vectors, and returns the resulting vector of tuples. The `strip` function is used to remove leading spaces and newlines from the question and answer strings.","status":200,"tokens":[141,470],"elapsed":4.195875875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
