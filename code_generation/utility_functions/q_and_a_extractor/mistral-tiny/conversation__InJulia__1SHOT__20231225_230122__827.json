When it encounters a \"Question\" line, it stores the question label and pushes it to the `questions` array. Once it encounters an \"Answer\" line, it extracts the text between the two labels using the `extract_text_between` helper function and pushes it to the `answers` array. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the extracted questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[100,602],"elapsed":5.276224834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
