X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Regular expressions for pattern matching\n   - String manipulation functions for stripping leading spaces and newlines\n   - Array manipulation functions for extracting subarrays\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n\n    for i in 1:length(lines)\n        line = lines[i]\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_index = i\n            while !startswith(lines[i+1], \"# Answer\") && i < length(lines)\n                i += 1\n            end\n            question = String(lines[question_index+1:i-1])\n            question = strip(question)\n            push!(questions, question)\n\n            answer_index = i+1\n            answer = String(lines[answer_index+1:end])\n            answer = strip(answer)\n            push!(answers, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (questions, answers)\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe function `q_and_a_extractor` takes a markdown-formatted text as an argument and returns a tuple containing all the question-answer pairs in the text. It uses regular expressions or string matching to identify the question and answer sections and extracts the text between them while stripping leading spaces and newlines. The function assumes that each question is followed by an answer, and both are marked with the respective headers `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n\nTo test the function, you can call it with a sample markdown text:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is a question.\n\n# Answer 1\nThis is the answer to question 1.\n\n# Question 2\nWhat is the capital city of France?\n\n# Answer 2\nParis is the capital city of France.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(questions_answers)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```julia\n([\"This is a question.\", \"What is the capital city of France?\"], [\"This is the answer to question 1.\", \"Paris is the capital city of France.\"])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[407,592],"elapsed":5.1594385,"_type":"aimessage"}]
