It then iterates through each line and checks if it starts with \"# Question:\" or \"# Answer:\". If it finds a question line, it creates a `Question` object and pushes the question text to the `questions` vector. If it finds an answer line, it creates an `Answer` object and pushes the answer text to the `answers` vector.\n\nThe `Question` and `Answer` types are defined as simple structs with a `question` or `answer` field, respectively.\n\nThe `strip` function is a helper function that takes a string, strips leading spaces and newlines, and returns the stripped string.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that each question has exactly one answer, and that questions and answers follow each other directly (i.e., there are no empty lines between them). If these assumptions do not hold, the function would need to be modified accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[100,525],"elapsed":4.7183395,"_type":"aimessage"}]
