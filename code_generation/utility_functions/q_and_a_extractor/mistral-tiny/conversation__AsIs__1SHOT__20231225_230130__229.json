It then extracts the corresponding question and answer text, and returns a list of tuples containing the questions and answers.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes the markdown text is provided as a string. If the markdown is stored in a file, use the `read_text()` method from the `iopandas` library to read the file as a string before passing it to the function. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom IPython.io import read_text\n\nmarkdown_file = \"markdown_file.md\"\nmd = read_text(markdown_file)\nquestions_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[97,390],"elapsed":3.394538375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
