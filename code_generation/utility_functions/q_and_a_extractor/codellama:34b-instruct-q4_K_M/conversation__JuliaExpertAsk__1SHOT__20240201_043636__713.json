Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

This creates an array of strings, where each string represents a section in the markdown document.\n\nNext, we extract the question and answer sections by indexing into the `sections` array. We use the indices 2 and 4 to access the question and answer sections, respectively, because they are located at those positions in the `sections` array.\n\nFinally, we strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using the `strip()` function, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace characters from a string. This ensures that the output is clean and free of unnecessary characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,265],"elapsed":7.390773825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
