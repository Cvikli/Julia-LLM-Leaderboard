The `q_and_a_extractor` function takes a single argument `md`, which is the markdown text to be processed.\n2. The first line splits the markdown text into sections based on the heading levels (i.e., lines that start with `#`). This creates a list of strings, where each string represents a section in the markdown document.\n3. The `filter` function is used to extract only the Question and Answer sections from the list of sections. The `startswith` function is used to check if a given section starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\". The resulting lists are `questions` and `answers`.\n4. The `map` function is used to apply the `strip` function to each element in the `questions` and `answers` lists, respectively. This removes any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n5. Finally, the `return` statement returns a tuple containing the extracted questions and answers, in that order. The tuple is created using the `(questions, answers)` syntax.\n\nYou can use this function to extract the Questions and Answers from a markdown document like this:\n```\njulia> md = \"\"\"# Question 1\n       What is your name?\n       # Answer\n       My name is John.\n       # Question 2\n       What is your favorite color?\n       # Answer\n       My favorite color is blue.\"\"\"\njulia> q_and_a_extractor(md)\n((\"What is your name?\", \"My name is John.\"), (\"What is your favorite color?\", \"My favorite color is blue.\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,536],"elapsed":14.974197704,"_type":"aimessage"}]
