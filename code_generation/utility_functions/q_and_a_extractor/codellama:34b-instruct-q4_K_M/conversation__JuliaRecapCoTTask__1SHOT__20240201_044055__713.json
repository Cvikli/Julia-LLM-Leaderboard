[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

It is designed to be as fast as C++ and as easy to use as Python, with a syntax similar to MATLAB. Julia has a growing ecosystem of packages for numerical and scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and more.\n\n# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n# Example\n\nHere is an example of how you can use `q_and_a_extractor` to extract questions and answers from a markdown document:\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\n\nThis is the first question.\n\n# Answer 1\n\nThis is the answer to the first question.\n\n# Question 2\n\nThis is the second question.\n\n# Answer 2\n\nThis is the answer to the second question.\n\"\"\"\nquestions, answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprint(questions)  # Output: [\"Question 1\", \"Question 2\"]\nprint(answers)    # Output: [\"Answer 1\", \"Answer 2\"]\n```\n# Implementation\n\nHere is one possible implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = []\n    answers = []\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            push!(questions, strip(line[10:end]))\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            push!(answers, strip(line[8:end]))\n        end\n    end\n    return questions, answers\nend\n```\nThis function uses a for loop to iterate over the lines of the markdown document. For each line, it checks if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If so, it extracts the text after the hash sign and strips any leading spaces or newlines. The extracted text is then added to the `questions` or `answers` list, respectively. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the questions and answers.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown document has a consistent format, with each question and answer separated by a newline. If the document has a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,596],"elapsed":16.855203274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
