Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n\nSolution:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown into sections based on heading levels\n    sections = split(md, r\"^#+\")\n    \n    # Find the indices of the Question and Answer sections\n    question_index = findfirst(isequal(\"Question\"), sections)\n    answer_index = findfirst(isequal(\"Answer\"), sections)\n    \n    # Extract the text from the Question and Answer sections\n    question = strip(sections[question_index + 1])\n    answer = strip(sections[answer_index + 1])\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe function first splits the markdown text into sections based on heading levels using the `split` function with a regular expression. It then finds the indices of the Question and Answer sections using the `findfirst` function with the section names as arguments. Finally, it extracts the text from the Question and Answer sections using slicing and the `strip` function to remove leading spaces and newlines. The extracted text is returned in a tuple like `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,626],"elapsed":17.751215231,"_type":"aimessage"}]
