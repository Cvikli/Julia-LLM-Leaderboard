Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here's a sample implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n(.*?)\\n# Answer\\n(.*?)\\n\", md, Regex.GenericRegex)\n    if question === nothing\n        return nothing\n    else\n        q_text = question.captures[1]\n        a_text = question.captures[2]\n        return (strip(q_text), strip(a_text))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can call the `q_and_a_extractor` function with your markdown-formatted text `md` to extract the question and answer sections as a tuple.
