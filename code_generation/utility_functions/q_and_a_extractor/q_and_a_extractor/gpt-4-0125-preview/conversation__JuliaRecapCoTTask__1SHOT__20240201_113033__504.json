[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve the task of extracting question and answer sections from a markdown-formatted text, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Split the text** into sections using the headings `# Question` and `# Answer` as delimiters.\n2. **Extract the question and answer text** from the respective sections.\n3. **Clean up the extracted sections** by removing any leading or trailing whitespace or newlines.\n4. **Return the extracted text** in a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\nLet's implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function using these steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Split the markdown text into sections based on headings\n    sections = split(md, r\"# Question|# Answer\")\n    \n    # Initialize question and answer strings\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through the sections to find and extract question and answer\n    for (i, section) in enumerate(sections)\n        # Check if this is the question section\n        if occursin(r\"# Question\", section)\n            question = strip(section[11:end]) # Remove the heading and leading/trailing whitespace\n        elseif occursin(r\"# Answer\", section)\n            answer = strip(section[9:end]) # Remove the heading and leading/trailing whitespace\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nNote: This code assumes there's only one `# Question` and one `# Answer` section. It processes the markdown by splitting it based on the occurrences of these specific headings. Then, it isolates the text of interest and removes any leading or trailing spaces/newlines to clean it up before returning the result. \n\nThis solution follows a systematic approach and makes use of Julia's regular expressions for detection of the specific sections, and string manipulation functionalities for cleaning up the extracted content.","status":200,"tokens":[349,387],"elapsed":36.549299583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
