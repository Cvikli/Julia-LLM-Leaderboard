X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Here's the plan:\n1. Identify and extract the relevant `Question` and `Answer` sections from the markdown text.\n2. Clean the extracted content by removing leading spaces and newlines.\n3. Return the cleaned Question and Answer as a tuple.\n\nLet's begin with the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown content into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n  \n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    current_section = nothing\n  \n    # Iterate over each line to extract question and answer\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line marks the beginning of 'Question' or 'Answer'\n        if occursin(\"# Question\", line)\n            current_section = :question\n        elseif occursin(\"# Answer\", line)\n            current_section = :answer\n        else\n            # Append the line to the appropriate section\n            if current_section == :question\n                push!(question, line)\n            elseif current_section == :answer\n                push!(answer, line)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n  \n    # Join lines to form the extracted text and strip leading/trailing whitespace and newlines\n    question_text = strip(join(question, \"\\n\"))\n    answer_text = strip(join(answer, \"\\n\"))\n  \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function starts by splitting the input markdown text into individual lines. It then iterates over each line, determining whether the line belongs to the `Question` or `Answer` section based on the current section marker. Lines belonging to these sections are appended to respective arrays. Once the iteration is complete, the function joins lines for each section back into strings, performs cleanup to remove any leading or trailing spaces and newlines, and finally returns the result as a tuple.\n\nLet's do a brief correctness check with a basic example:\n\n```julia\nmd_example = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is Julia?\n\nJulia is a high-performance, high-level programming language.\n\n# Answer\nJulia is designed for computational science and numerical analysis.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_example)\nprintln(q_and_a)\n```\n\nThis is expected to extract and return the `Question` and `Answer` in the provided markdown text without any leading or trailing spaces or newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[349,505],"elapsed":42.378289042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
