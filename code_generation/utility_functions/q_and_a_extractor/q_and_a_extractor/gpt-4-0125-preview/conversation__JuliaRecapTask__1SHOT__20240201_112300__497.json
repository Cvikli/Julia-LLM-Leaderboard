[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Split the markdown text into sections based on the markdown headings for Question and Answer, which are `# Question` and `# Answer`. We'll search for these headings to split the text.\n\n2. Once the sections are identified, extract the text for the Question and Answer sections. We should remove any leading spaces and newlines from both sections.\n\n3. Return the extracted question and answer texts in a tuple.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines for processing\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize variables to hold question and answer sections\n    question_section = \"\"\n    answer_section = \"\"\n\n    # Markers to detect if we are currently in the Question or Answer section\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line is a Question or Answer header\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # Add lines to the appropriate section based on which section we are currently in\n        if in_question\n            question_section *= line * \"\\n\"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer_section *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing spaces and newlines\n    question_section = strip(question_section)\n    answer_section = strip(answer_section)\n\n    return (question_section, answer_section)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the markdown text into lines, then iterates over each line to determine whether it's part of the Question or Answer section based on the presence of `# Question` or `# Answer` headers. It concatenates lines into the appropriate section and finally returns the stripped question and answer texts in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[348,415],"elapsed":30.427463667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
