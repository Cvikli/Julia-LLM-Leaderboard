X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Also, string manipulation functions to clean the extracted text.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**: Implement a function `q_and_a_extractor` that:\n    - Takes a markdown text as input.\n    - Uses regular expressions to find text under \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\" headers.\n    - Cleans the extracted text from any leading spaces and newlines.\n    - Returns the cleaned question and answer as a tuple.\n\n3. **Double-check Solution**: Ensure the solution works for different markdown structures and cleans the text accurately.\n\nHere's how to go about it:\n\n### Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString, AbstractString}\n    # Regular expression patterns to identify question and answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\s+(.*)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\s+(.*)\"\n\n    # Extract question and answer using regex\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    # Initialize question and answer strings\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    if question_match !== nothing\n        question = question_match.captures[1]\n    end\n\n    if answer_match !== nothing\n        answer = answer_match.captures[1]\n    end\n\n    # Clean captured strings from leading/trailing white spaces and newlines\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We define `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown text and returns a tuple of strings.\n- Using regular expressions, we identify sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\".\n- The `match` function searches for these patterns. If found, we extract the content following these headers.\n- The `strip` function removes any leading/trailing spaces or newlines from the extracted text.\n- Finally, we return a tuple containing the cleaned question and answer.\n\nLetâ€™s double-check this logic with an example:\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md_text)\n```\n\nThis should accurately extract \"What is the capital of France?\" as the question and \"The capital of France is Paris.\" as the answer, with no leading or trailing spaces or newlines.","status":200,"tokens":[349,528],"elapsed":32.3287415,"_type":"aimessage"}]
