Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task, the first step is to define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes markdown-formatted text `md` as input. The approach will be to split the input text into sections based on the markdown headers for question and answer, extract the relevant texts, and return them as a tuple after stripping any leading spaces and newlines.\n\n### Step 1: Define the function\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the text into sections\n    sections = split(md, \"# \")\n    \n    # Initialize empty strings for question and answer\n    question, answer = \"\", \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through sections to find question and answer\n    for section in sections\n        if startswith(section, \"Question\")\n            question = strip(section[9:end])  # Remove \"Question\" and strip leading/trailing whitespaces/newlines\n        elseif startswith(section, \"Answer\")\n            answer = strip(section[7:end])  # Remove \"Answer\" and strip leading/trailing whitespaces/newlines\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Task\n\nUse the `q_and_a_extractor` function with the provided markdown text to solve the task.\n\n```julia\nmd_text = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\n\n# Extract question and answer\nq_and_a = q_and_a_extractor(md_text)\nprintln(q_and_a)\n```\n\nThe function first splits the provided input by sections starting with \"#\" which allows it to process markdown headers. It filters for sections starting with \"Question\" and \"Answer\", respectively, extracts the text following these headers, and finally strips any leading or trailing whitespaces or newlines.\n  \nThe expected output for the given data will be a tuple containing the question \"What is the capital of France?\" and the answer \"The capital of France is Paris.\"","status":200,"tokens":[208,399],"elapsed":35.858352875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
