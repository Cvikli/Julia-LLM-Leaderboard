[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task in Julia, we'll define a `q_and_a_extractor` function that processes the provided markdown-formatted text `md`. This function will search for lines starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively, and extract the relevant text following these headings. The function will:\n- Split the `md` text into lines.\n- Iterate over the lines, identifying those that mark the beginning of Question and Answer sections.\n- Accumulate text for each section until another section starts.\n- Return the extracted Question and Answer texts as a tuple.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String, String}\n    # Split the markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Initialize variables to hold the extracted sections\n    current_section = nothing\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over the lines of the markdown\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the current line marks the beginning of a section\n        if startswith(strip(line), \"# Question\")\n            current_section = :question\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(strip(line), \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = :answer\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        # Append the line to the respective section based on the current section\n        if current_section == :question\n            question *= line * \"\\n\"  # Append the line and a newline character\n        elseif current_section == :answer\n            answer *= line * \"\\n\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the extracted Question and Answer, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace or newlines\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n```\n\nThis function employs a simple state machine mechanism for determining which part of the markdown text it is currently processing (`:question` or `:answer`). It appends lines to either `question` or `answer`, depending on the current section, omitting the section headers (`# Question` and `# Answer`). Finally, it strips any leading or trailing spaces and newlines from the extracted `question` and `answer` strings before returning them.","status":200,"tokens":[349,441],"elapsed":41.697743625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
