[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we'll follow these steps within our Julia function `q_and_a_extractor`:\n\n1. Identify sections that start with `# Question` and `# Answer` in the provided markdown text.\n2. Extract the content of these sections.\n3. Return the extracted content in a tuple after cleaning it up from leading spaces and newlines.\n\nLet's implement the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{String,String}\n    # Breakdown the markdown into lines for processing\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    \n    # Variables to store extracted question and answer\n    question = []\n    answer = []\n    # Tracking whether we are in a question or answer section\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if we're entering a question section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        end\n        # Check if we're entering an answer section\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            in_question = false\n            continue\n        end\n\n        # If we're in a question section, append the line to the question\n        if in_question\n            push!(question, line)\n        end\n\n        # If we're in an answer section, append the line to the answer\n        if in_answer\n            push!(answer, line)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Convert arrays back to strings and clean up\n    question_text = join(question, '\\n') |> strip\n    answer_text = join(answer, '\\n') |> strip\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We initially break down the markdown input into lines for easier processing.\n- We use boolean flags `in_question` and `in_answer` to track whether the current line is within the Question or Answer section.\n- For lines within these sections, we append them to the respective arrays.\n- After processing all lines, we join the array elements back into strings, clean up leading and trailing spaces/newlines, and return them as a tuple.\n\nThis approach considers that the document may contain multiple sections, but it captures and combines content from Sections identified with `# Question` and `# Answer`. If the document structure varies, adjustments may be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[348,491],"elapsed":44.860095416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
