[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this task systematically, let's start by identifying useful Julia snippets that align with our objectives.\n\n### Useful Julia Snippets\n\n1. **Regular expressions (Regex)**: Since the task revolves around pattern extraction from text, regex could be quite useful for identifying and extracting sections that begin with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n   \n    ```julia\n    match(regex, string)\n    ```\n\n2. **Multiline strings**: Given that markdown documents can be quite lengthy and span multiple lines, understanding how to work with multiline strings in Julia is fundamental.\n\n    ```julia\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a \n    multiline string.\n    \"\"\"\n    ```\n\n3. **String processing functions**: To strip unwanted characters such as leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text, functions like `strip` will come in handy.\n\n    ```julia\n    strip(string)\n    ```\n\nWith these snippets and concepts in mind, let's move on to solving the task.\n\n### Solving the Task\n\nI'll define the function `q_and_a_extractor` which takes a markdown-formatted text `md` and returns a tuple containing the extracted question and answer.\n\n1. Use regex to identify and capture content after `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n2. Extract the matched groups and perform cleanup operations such as stripping unnecessary whitespace.\n3. Return the cleaned question and answer as a tuple.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions to find Question and Answer sections\n    question_regex = r\"# Question\\s*(.*?)\\s*(?=#|$)\"s\n    answer_regex = r\"# Answer\\s*(.*?)\\s*(?=#|$)\"s\n    \n    # Use match to search for Question and Answer\n    question_match = match(question_regex, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_regex, md)\n    \n    # Extracting text, ensuring we have matches; else, return empty strings\n    question_text = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer_text = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-checking the Solution\n\nIt is essential to verify that our implementation correctly extracts questions and answers from markdown text without including leading spaces or newline characters. To ensure correctness, I'll check the function with a simple markdown input as follows:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nprintln(q_and_a_extractor(md))\n```\n\nThe expected output should be:\n```\n(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis implementation should be efficient for various inputs while adhering to Julia's best practices.","status":200,"tokens":[349,576],"elapsed":40.286708167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
