[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets that might be useful**: \n    - Regular expressions (regex) might be quite helpful to match the patterns for `Question` and `Answer` sections in the markdown text.\n    - String manipulation functions such as `strip()` to remove leading and trailing whitespaces or newlines.\n\n2. **Solve the Task**:\n    - We will use the `match()` function along with a proper regex to find the parts of the markdown text that constitute the Question and Answer sections.\n    - Then, we will extract and clean the text from these sections.\n\n3. **Double-Check the Solution**:\n    - Ensure the returned values are stripped of any leading or trailing spaces and newlines.\n\nNow, let's implement the solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)::Tuple{AbstractString,AbstractString}\n    # Regex pattern to capture the contents of Question and Answer sections\n    question_pattern = r\"# Question\\n+(.*?)\\n+#\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"# Answer\\n+(.*?)(\\n+#|$)\"\n\n    # Match the patterns\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md)\n\n    # Extract and clean the matches\n    question_text = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer_text = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n\n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines regular expressions to capture the text following the `# Question` and before the next heading (assumed to be the start of the `# Answer` section or any other heading), and similarly for the `# Answer` section. If either section is not found, the function will safely handle these cases by checking for `nothing` and returning an empty string for the missing section. The `strip` function is used to remove any leading or trailing white space or newline characters from the captured text.","status":200,"tokens":[349,422],"elapsed":37.93729175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
