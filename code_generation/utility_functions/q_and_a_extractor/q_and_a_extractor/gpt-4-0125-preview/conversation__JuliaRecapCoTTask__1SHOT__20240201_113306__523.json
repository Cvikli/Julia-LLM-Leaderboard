[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I will write a Julia function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted text `md` as input. This function will search through the input text to find sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, extract the text following these markers until the next section or end of the text, and return a tuple containing the question and answer texts with any leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\nHereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Find the positions where the `# Question` and `# Answer` sections start.\n2. Extract the text following these markers until the next header or end of the text.\n3. Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted texts.\n4. Return the texts as a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n\n### Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- Using regular expressions: `match(r\"# Question(.*)# Answer\", md, flags=Regex.DOTALL)`\n- Substring extraction: `text[start:end]`\n- Trimming whitespaces and newlines: `strip(text)`\n\n### Solve the Task\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Define the patterns\n    question_pattern = r\"^# Question\\n(.+?)\\n(?=#|$)\"\n    answer_pattern = r\"^# Answer\\n(.+?)\\n(?=#|$)\"\n    \n    # Search for the question and answer sections\n    question_match = match(question_pattern, md, 0, Regex.MULTILINE)\n    answer_match = match(answer_pattern, md, 0, Regex.MULTILINE)\n    \n    # Extract the texts and strip spaces and newlines\n    question_text = question_match !== nothing ? strip(question_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    answer_text = answer_match !== nothing ? strip(answer_match.captures[1]) : \"\"\n    \n    return (question_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check that the solution is correct\nTo ensure that the solution works as intended, let's perform a simple test case. Note that, unlike languages like Python, Julia uses `Regex.MULTILINE` directly as an argument to control the regular expression flags.\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Extracted Q&A: \", result)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n```\nExtracted Q&A: (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nThis solution uses regular expressions to find the start of the sections marked `# Question` and `# Answer` and extracts the content. Note that Julia's regex might require a slightly different syntax or flags adjustment, as the specifics can differ from one programming language to another.","status":200,"tokens":[349,576],"elapsed":76.314228875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
