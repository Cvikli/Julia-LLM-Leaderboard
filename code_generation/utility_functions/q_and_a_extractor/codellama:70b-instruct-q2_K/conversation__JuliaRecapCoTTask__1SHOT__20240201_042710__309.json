[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Start by creating an empty string for each of question and answer.\n```julia\nquestion = \"\"\nanswer = \"\"\n```\n2. Loop through each line in the markdown text, using a `for` loop or a comprehension.\n3. Use regular expressions to check if the current line starts with `# Question`. If it does, set `current_section` to \"question\". Similarly, if the line starts with `# Answer`, set `current_section` to \"answer\".\n4. For each line, strip leading spaces and newlines using `strip` or regular expressions.\n5. Concatenate the stripped text onto the appropriate section string, depending on the value of `current_section`.\n6. After looping through all lines, return a tuple with question and answer strings.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    current_section = \"\"  # Can be \"question\" or \"answer\".\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    for line in eachline(strip.(split(md, \"\\n\")))\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        stripped_text = strip.(split(line))  # Strip leading spaces and newlines.\n        \n        if current_section == \"question\"\n            question *= stripped_text\n        elseif current_section == \"answer\"\n            answer *= stripped_text\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)  # Return a tuple with the question and answer.\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a markdown-formatted string `md` as input, extracts all text between `# Question` and `# Answer`, and returns them in a tuple `(question, answer)`. The resulting extracted strings are stripped of leading spaces and newlines before being returned.","status":200,"tokens":[0,459],"elapsed":19.020166001,"_type":"aimessage"}]
