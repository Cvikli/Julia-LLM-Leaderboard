[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. **Define Function**\n```julia-repl\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString) \n    # Extract the text between \"Question\" and \"Answer\".\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\nend \n```\n2. **Parse Markdown**\n\nJulia has a built-in `Markdown` package to parse markdown content:\n```julia-repl\nusing Markdown\nmd_parsed = Markdown.parse(md)\n```\n3. **Extract Question and Answer**\n\nYou can extract the text between \"Question\" and \"Answer\" using Julia's `Regex` package. Define a regex pattern that matches the markdown content between the two headings:\n```julia-repl\nregex_pattern = r\"^\\#\\s*Q(uestion)?\\n(.+)\\n+\\#\\s*Ans?w(er)?\"m # Regex to match Question and Answer heading.\nmatches = eachmatch(regex_pattern, string(md_parsed)) \n```\n4. **Strip Leading Spaces and Newlines**\n\nUse the `lstrip` function to remove leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text:\n```julia-repl\nquestion, answer = lstrip.(matches) # Strip leading spaces and newlines.\n```\n5. **Return Result as Tuple**\n\nReturn the question and answer as a tuple:\n```julia-repl\nreturn (question=question, answer=answer) \n```\n6. **Complete Function Definition**\n\nHere is the complete function definition:\n```julia-repl\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)  \n    using Markdown # Import Markdown package to parse markdown content.\n    \n    md_parsed = Markdown.parse(md) # Parse markdown content.\n        \n    regex_pattern = r\"^\\#\\s*Q(uestion)?\\n(.+)\\n+\\#\\s*Ans?w(er)?\"m  # Regex to match Question and Answer heading.\n    matches = eachmatch(regex_pattern, string(md_parsed)) # Match regex pattern against markdown content.\n    \n    question, answer = lstrip.(matches) # Strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n    \n    return (question=question, answer=answer)  # Return result as a tuple with named fields.\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a markdown-formatted string `md`, parses it using Julia's Markdown package, extracts the text between \"Question\" and \"Answer\", strips leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text, and returns the result as a tuple with named fields `(question=..., answer=...)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,638],"elapsed":26.939503488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
