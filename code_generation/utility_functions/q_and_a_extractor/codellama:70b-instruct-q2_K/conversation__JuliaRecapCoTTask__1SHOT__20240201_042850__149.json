[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Parse the markdown text as plaintext (without HTML tags) using an appropriate library or function.\n2. Extract all text in the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n3. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n4. Return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.\n5. Ensure that your solution works for arbitrary markdown input texts (e.g., nested lists, code blocks, etc.).\n6. Consider using regular expressions to identify and extract question/answer sections.\n7. Write the function signature as `q_and_a_extractor(md::String) -> Tuple{String, String}`.\n8. Use Julia's built-in functions and libraries, such as Markdown or Regex.\n9. Avoid hard-coding specific text or sections in your solution.\n10. Keep the code concise and clear for easier understanding and debugging.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```julia\ninput_text = \"# Question\\n## What is Julia language?\\n# Answer\\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language.\"\nq_and_a_extractor(input_text)\n```\nThis should return `(\"What is Julia language?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language.\")`.\n**Solution:**\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    mdlines = split(strip(Markdown.plaintext(parse(Markdown.MD, md))), \"\\n\") # parse markdown and get a list of lines\n\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(mdlines) # loop through each line\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            idx_end_question = findnext(\"\\n\", mdlines[1], i + 2) - 1\n            question = join(mdlines[(i+1):idx_end_question])\n        end\n    end\n\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(mdlines) # loop through each line\n        if startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            idx_end_answer = findnext(\"\\n\", mdlines[1], i + 2) - 1\n            answer = join(mdlines[(i+1):idx_end_answer])\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (question, answer) # tuple of question and answer\nend\n```\nThis function parses the markdown text into a list of lines using `Markdown.plaintext` from the Markdown package. It then loops through each line and looks for `# Question` or `# Answer`. When it finds one of these headers, it collects all the lines following it until the next newline character (`\\n`) is encountered. The extracted question and answer are returned in a tuple `(question,answer)`.\n\nThe function signature for this solution is: `q_and_a_extractor(md::String) -> Tuple{String, String}`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,685],"elapsed":28.51675847,"_type":"aimessage"}]
