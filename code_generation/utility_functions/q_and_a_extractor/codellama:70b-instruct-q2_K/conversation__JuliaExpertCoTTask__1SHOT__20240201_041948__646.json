Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes in a string `md`.\n2. Split the input text on `# Question` and store it in `question_section`.\n3. Split the input text on `# Answer` and store it in `answer_section`.\n4. Extract the text between these two sections by using the slice notation. This will give you the question and answer texts separately.\n5. Use the `strip()` function to remove any leading spaces and newlines from both extracted strings.\n6. Store the cleaned up question and answer in a tuple and return it as `(question,answer)`.\n7. If there are multiple Question and Answer sections in the input text, you can use a for loop to iterate through all pairs of sections and extract them into tuples.\n8. Finally, return the extracted tuples in a list format like `[(q1,a1), (q2,a2), ...]`.\n\nHere's a code snippet that implements this approach:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_section = split(md,\"# Question\")\n    answer_section = split(md,\"# Answer\")\n    \n    question,answer = strip.(split(question_section[2],\"# Answer\"))\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nIn the code snippet, we define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes in a string `md`. We then split this string on `# Question` and `# Answer`, extracting the text between them as question and answer. Finally, we use `strip()` to remove any leading spaces and newlines from both extracted strings and return them as a tuple `(question,answer)`.\n\nPlease note that if you have multiple questions and answers in your input text, it's possible to loop over all pairs of sections and extract them into tuples. You can then return the extracted tuples in a list format like `[(q1,a1), (q2,a2), ...]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":18.516217816,"_type":"aimessage"}]
