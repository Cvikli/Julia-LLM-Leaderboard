I will assume that if there are multiple questions and answers, we need to extract them all and return them in separate tuples within an array. Additionally, I will strip leading spaces and newlines from the extracted texts as requested in the Special Instructions.\n\nHere is my solution:\n\n```julia-repl\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines by using \\n character as separator\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Initialize variables to store question and answer texts\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n\n    # Iterate over each line in the Markdown text\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # Extract the question text after skipping the initial whitespace characters\n            start_idx = findfirst(\" \", line) + 1\n            q_text = strip(rstrip(lstrip(substring(line, start_idx))))\n            \n            # Check if the next line is a blank one, skip it in that case\n            if lines[i+1] == \"\"\n                i += 1\n            end\n        \n            # Extract the answer text and strip leading spaces and newlines\n            a_text = strip(rstrip(lstrip(lines[i+2])))\n            \n            # Store the question and answer texts in their respective arrays\n            push!(questions, q_text)\n            push!(answers, a_text)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return an array of tuples containing each question-answer pair\n    return [(q, a) for (q, a) in zip(questions, answers)]\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution, I am iterating over the lines in the Markdown text and looking for lines that start with `# Question`. If such line is found, I assume that the next non-empty line contains the answer. The extracted question and answer texts are then stripped of leading spaces and newlines as per the Special Instructions. The function returns an array of tuples containing each question-answer pair.","status":200,"tokens":[0,770],"elapsed":32.065518755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
