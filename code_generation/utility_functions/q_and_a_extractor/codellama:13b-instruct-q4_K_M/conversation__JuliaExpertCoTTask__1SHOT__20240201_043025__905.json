Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split the markdown into sections based on the header\n    sections = split(md, \"##\"; keepempty=false)\n    # Extract the question and answer from the sections\n    question = strip(sections[1])\n    answer = strip(sections[2])\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nNote that this solution assumes that there are exactly two sections in the markdown text, with the first section being the question and the second section being the answer. If there are more than two sections, or if the sections don't start with a header like \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", then this function will not work properly.\n\nAlso note that this solution assumes that you want to extract the text from the markdown sections without any leading spaces or newlines. If you want to preserve those, you can modify the `strip` functions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":2.805029941,"_type":"aimessage"}]
