It then iterates over each section and checks if it starts with `\"Question: \"` or `\"Answer: \"`. If so, it extracts the relevant text and stores it in the variables `question` and `answer`, respectively. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer strings.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input string is well-formed markdown, with the `# Question` and `# Answer` headers properly formatted. If the input string does not conform to this format, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.","status":200,"tokens":[128,258],"elapsed":3.470723554,"_type":"aimessage"}]
