[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

If a line starts with `# Question:`, the function stores the remaining text in the `question` variable, and if a line starts with `# Answer:`, the function stores the remaining text in the `answer` variable. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the question and answer strings.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formatted and does not contain any errors or inconsistencies. If the input text is not well-formatted, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an error.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":3.454782274,"_type":"aimessage"}]
