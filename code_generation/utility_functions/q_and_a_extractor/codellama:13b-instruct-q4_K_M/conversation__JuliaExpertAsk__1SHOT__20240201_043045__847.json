It then loops through each section and checks if it starts with \"Question\" or \"Answer\". If it is a question, it extracts the text from the section and assigns it to the `question` variable. If it is an answer, it extracts the text from the section and assigns it to the `answer` variable. Finally, it returns a tuple containing both the question and answer text.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":3.76880971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
