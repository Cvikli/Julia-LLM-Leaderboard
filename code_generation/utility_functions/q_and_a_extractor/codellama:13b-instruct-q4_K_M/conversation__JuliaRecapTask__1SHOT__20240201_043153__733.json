[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

This creates a section for each question and answer.\n* `startswith(section, \"Question\")` or `startswith(section, \"Answer\")`: Check if each section starts with either \"Question\" or \"Answer\".\n* `strip(split(section, \"\\n\")[1])`: Split the current section into a vector of strings based on newlines (`\\n`). Take the first element of the resulting vector and strip any leading spaces and newlines. This will extract the question or answer text from each section.\n* `push!(questions, ...)` or `push!(answers, ...)`: Add the extracted question or answer to their respective list.\n* `return (questions, answers)`: Return a tuple of both lists.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input markdown is formatted consistently and that each question and answer has its own section starting with a header `# Question` or `# Answer`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,405],"elapsed":5.582297181,"_type":"aimessage"}]
