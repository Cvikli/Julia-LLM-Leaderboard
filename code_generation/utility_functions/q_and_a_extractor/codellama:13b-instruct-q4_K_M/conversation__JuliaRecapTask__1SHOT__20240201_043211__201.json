[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one possible implementation of `q_and_a_extractor`:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    questions = String[]\n    answers = String[]\n    \n    for line in split(md, '\\n')\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") || startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            push!(questions, strip(split(line)[2]))\n            push!(answers, strip(split(line)[3]))\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (join(questions, \"\\n\"), join(answers, \"\\n\"))\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `startswith` function to check if a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", and then extracts the text after that using `split`. It then joins the extracted questions and answers into tuples using `join`, and returns them.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that there is only one question and answer per section, and that they are separated by a newline character. If your input data contains multiple questions or answers in a single section, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,257],"elapsed":3.605851692,"_type":"aimessage"}]
