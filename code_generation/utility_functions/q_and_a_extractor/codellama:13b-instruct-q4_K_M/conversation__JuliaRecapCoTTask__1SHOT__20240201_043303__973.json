[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's my solution to the problem you described:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Extract all sections starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\"\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    for line in split(md, \"\\n\")\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question *= strip(split(line, \":\")[2])\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer *= strip(split(line, \":\")[2])\n    end\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function assumes that the markdown text is provided in a string called `md`. It first splits the string into individual lines using the `split` function. Then it iterates over each line and checks if it starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\". If it does, it extracts the text after the colon using `strip` to remove leading spaces and newlines. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer text.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that there is only one section starting with \"# Question\" and one section starting with \"# Answer\" in the markdown text. If there are multiple sections, this function will extract only the first occurrence of each section and ignore any subsequent occurrences.","status":200,"tokens":[0,285],"elapsed":3.993935195,"_type":"aimessage"}]
