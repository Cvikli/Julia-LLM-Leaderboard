Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Let's break down the problem into smaller steps and solve it systematically using Julia language.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `String` manipulation functions like `sub`, `replace`, `split`, `trim`, etc.\n\t* `Regex` module for working with regular expressions\n\t* `parse` function for parsing Markdown text\n\t* `split` function for splitting a string into substrings\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Use `parse` function to parse the input markdown text and extract the question and answer sections\n\t* Use `split` function to split the extracted text into an array of strings, where each string represents a line of text in the question or answer section\n\t* Use Julia's built-in functions to clean up the text, remove leading spaces and newlines, and return the extracted text in a tuple like `(question, answer)`\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Use `println` function to print out the extracted text to verify that it matches the expected output\n\t* Use `isequal` function to compare the extracted text with the original input text to ensure that the solution is accurate\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n\nJulia has a simple syntax and provides many useful functions for working with strings, regular expressions, and other data types. Here are some key features of the Julia language:\n\n* `isX ? X : Y`: This ternary operator allows us to return a value based on a condition. The `is` keyword is used to check if a condition is true, and the `X` and `Y` variables are used to provide alternative values to return.\n* `function f(x) end`: Function definitions in Julia use the `function` keyword followed by the function name and parameter list. The function body can be defined using a series of statements separated by semicolons.\n* `x -> x^2`: Anonymous functions are used to define a function without a name. In this case, the anonymous function takes a single argument `x` and returns its square.\n* `[1, 2, 3]`: Arrays in Julia are defined using square brackets. The elements of the array can be separated by commas.\n* `a[1:2]`: Slicing allows us to extract a subset of an array based on a range of indices. In this case, we are extracting the first two elements of the array `a`.\n* `(1, 2)`: Tuples in Julia are defined using parentheses and can contain multiple elements separated by commas.\n* `Dict(\"key\" => value)`: Dictionary in Julia is defined using curly braces and keys are separated from values using a colon.\n* `$` for string interpolation: Julia provides a convenient way to interpolate strings using the `$` symbol. The string interpolation can include placeholders for variables that will be expanded at runtime.\n\nNow, let's use these features of Julia language to solve the task at hand!","status":200,"tokens":[399,655],"elapsed":28.286909959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
