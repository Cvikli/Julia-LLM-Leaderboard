Here's a function `q_and_a_extractor` that does what you described:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Split markdown into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Find Question and Answer sections\n    question_lines = filter(line => startswith(line, \"# Question\"), lines)\n    answer_lines = filter(line => startswith(line, \"# Answer\"), lines)\n    \n    # Extract text from Question and Answer sections\n    question = join(question_lines, \"\")\n    answer = join(answer_lines, \"\")\n    \n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n    question = strip(question)\n    answer = strip(answer)\n    \n    # Return tuple of (question, answer)\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\n> q_and_a_extractor(\"This is some markdown text with a question and answer. # Question What is the meaning of life? # Answer The meaning of life is 42.\")\n( \"What is the meaning of life?\", \"The meaning of life is 42.\" )\n```\nI hope this helps!
