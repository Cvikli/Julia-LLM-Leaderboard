Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer as a NamedTuple with keys `question` and `answer`. For a section to be valid, it must start at the beginning of the line. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.

Be careful with spaces and newlines! Use only `strip(str)`. Don't use `lstrip()` as it will remove the leading space in front of the section name.\n- It is OK to ignore any text that does not look like Question or Answer sections.\n- You can test your solution with a file, e.g., `md = read(\"your_markdown.md\", String)`","status":200,"tokens":[108,156],"elapsed":9.27478925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
