[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example of how you could implement a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract the question and answer sections from a markdown-formatted text in Julia:\n```\n# Question and Answer Extractor Function\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Find the line starting with \"# Question\"\n    question_line = findfirst(lines, /^# Question$/)\n    \n    # Find the line starting with \"# Answer\"\n    answer_line = findfirst(lines, /^# Answer$/)\n    \n    # Extract the question and answer text\n    question = strip(question_line[1:-1])\n    answer = strip(answer_line[1:-1])\n    \n    # Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```\n# Load the markdown text from a file\nmd = read(\"qanda.md\")\n\n# Extract the question and answer\n(question, answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n\n# Print the extracted question and answer\nprintln(\"Question: $question\")\nprintln(\"Answer: $answer\")\n```\nThis function works by splitting the input markdown text into lines, then finding the lines starting with \"# Question\" and \"# Answer\". It then extracts the text from those lines using the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing spaces. Finally, it returns the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the markdown text is formatted correctly, with the `# Question` and `# Answer` headings on separate lines. If your input text is not formatted this way, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[99,414],"elapsed":14.299436291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
