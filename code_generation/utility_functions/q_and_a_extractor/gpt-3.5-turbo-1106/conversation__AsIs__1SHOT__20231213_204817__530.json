Each tuple contains the extracted question and its corresponding answer, with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\nYou can use this function by passing the markdown-formatted text `md` as an argument to `q_and_a_extractor`. Then, the function will return the extracted questions and answers in the specified format.","status":200,"tokens":[88,254],"elapsed":4.705236125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
