Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

Here's how you can implement the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question = match(r\"# Question\\n([^#]+)\", md)\n    answer = match(r\"# Answer\\n([^#]+)\", md)\n\n    if question !== nothing && answer !== nothing\n        return (strip(question.captures[1]), strip(answer.captures[1]))\n    else\n        return nothing\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can then call this function with a markdown-formatted text to extract the question and answer sections. For example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[91,180],"elapsed":2.355225041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
