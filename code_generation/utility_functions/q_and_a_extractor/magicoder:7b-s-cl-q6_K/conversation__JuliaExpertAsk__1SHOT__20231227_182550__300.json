[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer with the knowledge of the latest syntax. Your communication is brief and concise.

Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this using the built-in `split` and `strip` functions in Julia. Here is how you might implement this:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    sections = split(md, \"###\")\n    question = strip(sections[2])\n    answer = strip(sections[3])\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by splitting the entire markdown text into individual sections using the `#` delimiter. The `split` function returns an array of strings with each string corresponding to a section of your markdown text. It splits on every occurrence of the given character, which in this case is `\"###\"`. After that, it simply strips any leading spaces and newlines from both question and answer sections using the `strip` function.\n\nPlease note that this will not work properly if your markdown text does not follow the exact format you mentioned (`# Question`, `# Answer`). This code assumes that every section is separated by at least one other section header (which we use to split on). If there are no such separators, then you might need a different approach. For example, you could use regular expressions to find the sections based on their exact starting string, or you could look for headers of the form `# Question` and `# Answer`, but that will get more complicated.","status":200,"tokens":[138,295],"elapsed":15.892171459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
