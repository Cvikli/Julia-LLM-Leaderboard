If it encounters a line starting with \"# Question\", then it switches into the \"question\" section mode. Likewise, if it encounters a line starting with \"# Answer\", then it switches into the \"answer\" section mode.\n\nIn both sections, if it encounters a line that does not start with \"## \", then it appends this line to whatever section is currently active and strips any leading spaces or newlines from it.\n\nFinally, once all lines have been processed, it returns the question and answer as a tuple. If there are no questions or answers in the markdown, an empty string will be returned for that component of the tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[138,366],"elapsed":19.631217208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
