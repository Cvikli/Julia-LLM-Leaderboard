Note that Markdown parsing and extraction can be more complex depending on the complexity of your markdown files.\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    \n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines \n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\") \n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue \n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\") \n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue \n        end \n        \n        if inQuestionSection \n            question *= line \n        elseif inAnswerSection \n            answer *= line \n        end \n    end \n    \n    return strip(question), strip(answer)  # remove leading/trailing whitespaces and newline characters\nend \n```\n\nThis function splits the input markdown string into lines, then iterates over each line. If a line starts with \"# Question\" or \"# Answer\", it toggles the corresponding boolean flag. If these flags are true and we encounter a line that is not starting with either of these strings, it appends this line to the question or answer text respectively.\n\nAfter going through all lines, the function returns the question and answer stripped of leading/trailing spaces and newline characters.","status":200,"tokens":[99,321],"elapsed":16.793968542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
