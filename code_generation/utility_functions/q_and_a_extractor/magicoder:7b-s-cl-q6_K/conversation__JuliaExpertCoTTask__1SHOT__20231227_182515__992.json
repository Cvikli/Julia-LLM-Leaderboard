Then for each line it checks if it is in Question or Answer section by checking its startswith(\"#\"). If it is in a question section and is not the section header, it adds to `question`. If it's in an answer section and not a section header, it adds to `answer`. At the end it returns the extracted questions and answers.","status":200,"tokens":[239,302],"elapsed":16.891399667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
