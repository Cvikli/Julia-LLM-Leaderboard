When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple Python solution using regular expressions:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef q_and_a_extractor(md):\n    question = re.findall('(?<=# Question\\n).*', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    answer = re.findall('(?<=# Answer\\n).*', md, re.DOTALL)[0].strip()\n    return (question,answer)\n```\n\nThis function works by using regular expressions to find the parts of the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`. `re.DOTALL` allows the dot `.` in the regex to match any character including newline.\n\nWe use `.strip()` at the end to remove leading spaces and newlines from each part of the question/answer text.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there is exactly one question and answer section in the markdown string, and it raises an exception if these sections are missing or have more than one occurrence. You may need to adjust this code depending on how you want to handle such cases. \n\nFor example, if the input text does not contain a Question/Answer section, the function will raise `IndexError: list index out of range`. If there is more than one question/answer pair in the text, it will also raise an exception. You may need to adjust this code depending on how you want to handle such cases.","status":200,"tokens":[239,302],"elapsed":17.090769834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
