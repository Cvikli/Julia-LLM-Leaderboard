[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        elseif current_section == \"question\"\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif current_section == \"answer\"\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThis function works by iterating over each line in the markdown string. If it encounters a line that starts with `# Question`, it changes `current_section` to `\"question\"` and continues appending to `question`. Likewise, if it encounters a line starting with `# Answer`, it changes `current_section` to `\"answer\"`. Any other lines are appended to the current section.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that your markdown will only have one question and answer per document. If there may be multiple questions or answers, you would need a more complex approach to handle them correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[399,294],"elapsed":17.379578166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
