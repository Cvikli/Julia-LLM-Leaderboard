[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution using Julia's built-in text processing and regular expressions:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Find the indices of the question and answer sections\n    idx_q = findfirst(occursin.(\"## Question\", md), 1:length(md))\n    idx_a = findfirst(occursin.(\"## Answer\", md), 1:length(md))\n    \n    # If either section does not exist, return an empty tuple\n    if idx_q === nothing || idx_a === nothing\n        return ()\n    end\n\n    # Extract the text within the question and answer sections\n    q = replace(split(md[idx_q+13:idx_a-2], \"\\n\")[1], r\"^ +\" => \"\", r\"\\n *\" => \" \")\n    a = replace(split(md[idx_a+10:end], \"\\n\")[1], r\"^ +\" => \"\", r\"\\n *\" => \" \")\n    \n    return (q, a)\nend\n```\n\nThis solution assumes the input `md` is already sanitized, so there's no need to handle different kinds of whitespace or special characters in between the question and answer sections. It splits the markdown string at the indices found by `findfirst`, then removes any leading spaces and newlines from each section using regular expressions before returning them as a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[399,328],"elapsed":19.206612708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
