Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple function written in Julia to solve this problem. This code uses regular expressions to find the sections and extract their text:\n\n```julia\nimport REGEX\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    matches = collect(eachmatch(REGEX.M,\"^\\\\s*#\\\\s*(Question|Answer)\", md, match_type=Int))\n    for i in 1:length(matches)-1\n        section = md[matches[i]:matches[i+1]-1]\n        if startswith(section, \"# Question\")\n            question = strip(split(section,'\\n')[2])\n        elseif startswith(section, \"# Answer\")\n            answer = strip(split(section,'\\n')[2])\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses `REGEX.M` to match the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer`. It then extracts these sections and uses `strip` to remove leading spaces and newline characters from the extracted text. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the question and answer.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is the first question.\n\n# Answer 1\nThis is the first answer.\n\n# Question 2\nThis is the second question.\n\n# Answer 2\nThis is the second answer.\n\"\"\"\nprint(q_and_a_extractor(md)) # prints (\"This is the first question.\", \"This is the first answer.\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[99,373],"elapsed":20.112532875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
