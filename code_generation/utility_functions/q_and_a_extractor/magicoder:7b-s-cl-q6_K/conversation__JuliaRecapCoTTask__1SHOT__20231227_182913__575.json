[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple implementation of `q_and_a_extractor` that works well for basic markdown text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    inQuestionSection = false\n    inAnswerSection = false\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            inQuestionSection = true\n            continue  # skip the line\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            inAnswerSection = true\n            continue  # skip the line\n        end\n        \n        if inQuestionSection\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif inAnswerSection\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nThe function works by first splitting the markdown text into lines and then iterating over those. When it sees a line that starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`, it toggles a boolean variable (`inQuestionSection` for questions, `inAnswerSection` for answers). Afterwards, if these flags are true (i.e., we're currently in the corresponding section), it adds the stripped text to the current string. Once it finds a line that doesn't start with either of these prefixes, it stops adding to those strings and continues on to the next line.\n\nNote: This function assumes that each question is followed by exactly one answer (as your task description implies). If there can be multiple answers or no answers at all, you might want to modify this to suit your needs better. \n\nYou'd use it like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question 1\nThis is the first question?\n# Answer 1\nYes, that's correct!\n# Question 2\nWhat does Julia do best?\n# Answer 2\nJulia does all kinds of things well!\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion_and_answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \\\"\", question_and_answer[1], \"\\\"\")\nprintln(\"Answer: \\\"\", question_and_answer[2], \"\\\"\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[402,501],"elapsed":28.42363225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
