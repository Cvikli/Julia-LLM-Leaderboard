It keeps track of whether it is currently inside the Question or Answer section and only adds text to the question or answer variable when those conditions are met. After reading all lines, it strips any trailing spaces and newline characters from each of the extracted strings before returning them in a tuple as `(question,answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[138,368],"elapsed":19.707073458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
