[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple approach using regular expressions to match the question and answer sections. The `strip` function is used to remove leading white spaces and newlines:\n```julia\nusing Markdown\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    # Extract text in Question section\n    question = strip(match(r\"# Question(.+?)# Answer\", md, seed=1).captures[1])\n    # Extract text in Answer section\n    answer = strip(match(r\"# Answer(.+?)$\", md, seed=1).captures[1])\n    return (question,answer)\nend\n```\nPlease note that this approach assumes the `# Question` and `# Answer` lines are unique within the markdown document. If there is a chance they could appear elsewhere in the text, additional code will be needed to properly parse the sections.","status":200,"tokens":[399,191],"elapsed":11.992065875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
