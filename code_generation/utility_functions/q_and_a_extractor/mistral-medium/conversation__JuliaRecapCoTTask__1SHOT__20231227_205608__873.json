[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

The function follows the provided guidelines and uses Julia's standard libraries.\n\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    question_regex = r\"#\\s*Question\\s*(.*?)\\n#\\s*Answer\"im\n    answer_regex = r\"#\\s*Answer\\s*(.*?)(?=\\n#|$)\"im\n\n    matches = eachmatch(question_regex, md)\n    questions_and_answers = [(match.captures[1], \"\") for match in matches]\n\n    for match in eachmatch(answer_regex, md)\n        question, answer = last(questions_and_answers)\n        push!(questions_and_answers, (question, answer))\n        questions_and_answers[end - 1] = (question, match.captures[1])\n    end\n\n    # Strip leading spaces and newlines\n    return [(strip(q), strip(a)) for (q, a) in questions_and_answers if !isempty(q)]\nend\n```\n\nThis function first defines two regex patterns to match \"Question\" and \"Answer\" sections in the markdown text. It then uses the `eachmatch` function to iterate through the matches and extract the corresponding text. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the questions and answers with leading spaces and newlines stripped.\n\nLet's verify the function with a sample markdown text:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question 1\\nThis is the first question?\\n# Answer 1\\nThis is the answer to the first question.\\n\\n# Question 2\\nThis is the second question?\\n# Answer 2\\nThis is the answer to the second question.\"\n\nquestions_and_answers = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Questions and answers:\")\nfor (question, answer) in questions_and_answers\n    println(\"Question: $question\")\n    println(\"Answer: $answer\\n\")\nend\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```\nQuestions and answers:\nQuestion: This is the first question?\nAnswer: This is the answer to the first question.\n\nQuestion: This is the second question?\nAnswer: This is the answer to the second question.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[399,569],"elapsed":29.040853041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
