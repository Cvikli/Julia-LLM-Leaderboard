Define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a string `md` as input and returns a tuple `(question, answer)`.\n2. Split the input string `md` into lines using the `split` function.\n3. Initialize an empty array `sections` to store the text of each section.\n4. Iterate through the lines and keep track of the current section using a variable `current_section`.\n5. When a line starts with `# Question`, initialize an empty string `question` and set `current_section` to `\"question\"`.\n6. When a line starts with `# Answer`, set `current_section` to `\"answer\"`.\n7. If `current_section` is `\"question\"` or `\"answer\"`, append the line (after stripping leading spaces and newlines) to the corresponding string variable.\n8. Once all lines have been processed, extract the question and answer text from the `sections` array.\n9. Return the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's the code for the above approach:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    sections = []\n    current_section = \"\"\n\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question = \"\"\n            current_section = \"question\"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            current_section = \"answer\"\n        elseif current_section != \"\"\n            line = strip(chomp(line))\n            sections[current_section] = get!(sections, current_section, \"\") * \" \" * line\n        end\n    end\n\n    question, answer = sections[\"question\"], sections[\"answer\"]\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\nTo check that the function is working correctly, we can test it with the sample input provided:\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"\nq, a = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n@assert q == \"What is the capital of France?\"\n@assert a == \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n```\nIf the above assertions pass, then we can be confident that the function is working correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[237,536],"elapsed":53.784537458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
