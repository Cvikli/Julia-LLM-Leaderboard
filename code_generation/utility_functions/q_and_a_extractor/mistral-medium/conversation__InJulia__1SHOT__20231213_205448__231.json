For each match, it extracts the question text using the first capture group of the regular expression. It then uses the `match` function to find the corresponding answer section, which follows immediately after the question section. The answer text is extracted using the first capture group of the answer regular expression, and the leading spaces and newlines are stripped using the `strip` function. Finally, the function returns a tuple of question and answer pairs.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question - What is Julia?\n\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing.

Julia's just-in-time compiler generates machine code that is as fast as code written in statically-typed languages like C and Fortran. Julia's syntax is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, even for programmers who are new to the language. Julia's built-in package manager allows users to easily install and use a wide variety of packages, including those for scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis.\n\n# Answer\n\nSome of the benefits of using Julia include its high performance, ease of use, and extensibility.
