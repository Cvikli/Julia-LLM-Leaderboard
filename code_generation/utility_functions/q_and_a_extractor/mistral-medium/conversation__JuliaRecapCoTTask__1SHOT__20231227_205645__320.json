[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Using the Julia language, we can write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer. Here's a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into lines\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n\n    # Initialize empty variables to store the question and answer\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate through the lines of the markdown text\n    for line in lines\n        # Check if the line starts with '# Question'\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            # Remove leading spaces and '# Question' from the line\n            question = strip(replace(line, r\"^#\\s+Question\" => \"\"))\n\n            # Reset the answer variable\n            answer = \"\"\n        # Check if the line starts with '# Answer'\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            # Remove leading spaces and '# Answer' from the line\n            answer_line = strip(replace(line, r\"^#\\s+Answer\" => \"\"))\n\n            # Append the answer line to the answer variable, with a newline character in between\n            answer *= \"\\n$answer_line\"\n        # Check if the line is not empty and we have a question\n        elseif !isempty(question)\n            # Append the line to the answer variable, with a newline character in between\n            answer *= \"\\n$line\"\n        end\n\n        # Check if both the question and answer are not empty\n        if !isempty(question) && !isempty(answer)\n            # Return the question and answer as a tuple\n            return (question, answer)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # If we didn't find any question and answer sections, return an empty tuple\n    return ()\nend\n```\n\nThis function first splits the input markdown text into lines and initializes empty variables to store the question and answer. It then iterates through the lines and checks if they start with `# Question` or `# Answer`. If a line starts with `# Question`, it removes the leading spaces and `# Question` from the line and stores it in the `question` variable. If a line starts with `# Answer`, it removes the leading spaces and `# Answer` from the line and appends it to the `answer` variable. If a line is not empty and we have a question, it appends the line to the `answer` variable. Once both the question and answer are not empty, the function returns them as a tuple. If the function doesn't find any question and answer sections, it returns an empty tuple.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the markdown text is well-formed and that each question and answer section is separated by at least one newline character. If the input text is not well-formed, the function may not work correctly.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\"\n\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThis should return the tuple `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")`.","status":200,"tokens":[399,729],"elapsed":36.038129916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
