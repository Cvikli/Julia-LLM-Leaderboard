The `match` function is then used to find the first occurrence of each pattern in the markdown text. If both patterns are found, the captured text is extracted and stripped of any leading spaces and newlines before being returned in a tuple. If either pattern is not found, an error is thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[136,302],"elapsed":13.400535375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
