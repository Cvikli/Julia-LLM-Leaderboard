It then iterates through the Question sections, finds the corresponding Answer section, and stores the results in a tuple.\n\nYou can test the function with the following example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nWhat is Julia?\n\n# Answer\nJulia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing.\n\n# Question\nWho created Julia?\n\n# Answer\nJulia was created by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman.\n\"\"\"\n\nqa_tuples = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(qa_tuples)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n((\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing.\"), (\"Who created Julia?\", \"Julia was created by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman.\"))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[97,557],"elapsed":24.189264375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
