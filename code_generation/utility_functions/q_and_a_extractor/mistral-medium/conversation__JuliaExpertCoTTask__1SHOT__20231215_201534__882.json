Define a function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes a markdown-formatted string `md` as input.\n2. Split the input string into lines using the `split` function.\n3. Initialize empty strings `question` and `answer` to store the extracted text.\n4. Iterate through the lines and check if the line starts with `# Question` or `# Answer`.\n5. If the line starts with `# Question`, remove the leading `# Question` and any leading spaces, and append the remaining text to the `question` string.\n6. If the line starts with `# Answer`, remove the leading `# Answer` and any leading spaces, and append the remaining text to the `answer` string.\n7. Once all lines have been processed, return a tuple containing the `question` and `answer` strings.\n8. Test the function with the provided example data.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    lines = split(md, '\\n')\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            question *= strip(line[11:end]) * \" \"\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_answer = true\n            answer *= strip(line[9:end]) * \" \"\n        elseif in_question\n            question *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line) * \" \"\n        end\n    end\n    return (strip(question), strip(answer))\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided example data\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"\n@assert q_and_a_extractor(md) == (\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")\n```\n\nNote that the function assumes that the markdown sections for Question and Answer are properly formatted and that there are no other sections with similar formatting. If the input data is not well-formed, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[237,526],"elapsed":17.437367458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
