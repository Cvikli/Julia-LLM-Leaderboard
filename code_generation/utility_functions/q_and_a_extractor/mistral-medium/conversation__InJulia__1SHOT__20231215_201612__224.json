It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.\n\n# Question - What are the benefits of using Julia?\n\nSome benefits of using Julia include its high performance, ease of use, and extensive library of mathematical functions.\n\n# Answer\n\nJulia's high performance is due to its just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which allows it to approach the speed of C while still providing the ease of use of a high-level language. Julia's syntax is also familiar to users of other technical computing environments, making it easy to learn and use. Additionally, Julia has an extensive library of mathematical functions, making it well-suited for technical computing tasks.\n\"\"\"\n\nqa_pairs = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(qa_pairs)\n```\n\nThis should output the following:\n\n```\n((\"What is Julia?\", \"Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments.
