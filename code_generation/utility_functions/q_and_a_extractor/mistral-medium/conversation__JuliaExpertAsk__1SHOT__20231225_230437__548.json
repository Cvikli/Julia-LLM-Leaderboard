It first defines a pattern for the Question and Answer sections and checks if there's a match in the input `md`. If there's no match, the function returns an empty tuple. Otherwise, it extracts the question and answer text, removes leading spaces and newlines, and returns the result as a tuple `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[136,299],"elapsed":10.086816291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
