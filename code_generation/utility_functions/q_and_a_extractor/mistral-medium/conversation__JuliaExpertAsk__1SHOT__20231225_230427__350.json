It then extracts the question text by capturing the group that matches any number of characters in between. If a match is found, it then looks for the answer text by searching for a pattern that starts with `# Answer` and ends with either `#` or the end of the string. It captures the group that matches any number of characters in between and returns the question and answer as a tuple.\n\nNote that the regular expressions used in this function are quite specific to the format of the input markdown text, so this function may not work correctly if the format is different. Additionally, this function assumes that there is only one question and answer section in the input text. If there are multiple sections, this function will only extract the first one.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text md. Write a function q_and_a_extractor to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with # Question and # Answer, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like (question,answer).

Write a function q_and_a_extractor to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with # Question and # Answer, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like (question,answer).
