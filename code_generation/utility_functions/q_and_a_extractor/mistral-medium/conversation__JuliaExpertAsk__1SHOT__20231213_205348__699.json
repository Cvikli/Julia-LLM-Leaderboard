The `s` flag at the end of the pattern string makes the `.` character match newlines as well as other characters. The `i` flag makes the pattern case-insensitive, so it will match `# Question` and `# question` equally well. The `m` flag is not necessary in this case, but it can be useful if you want the `^` and `$` characters to match the beginning and end of each line, rather than the beginning and end of the entire string.\n\nThe `match()` function returns a `Match` object if the pattern matches the string, and `nothing` otherwise. The `captures` property of the `Match` object contains a tuple of all the captured substrings, in order. In this case, we only expect one capture group, which is the text between `# Question` and `# Answer`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further clarification.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the question specified that the answer should be returned in a tuple, so I updated the function to do that. It was originally returning a named tuple.\n\nEdit 2: I also updated the function to handle the case where the answer is not present in the markdown text. In this case, it returns an empty string for the answer.","status":200,"tokens":[136,549],"elapsed":20.536802875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
