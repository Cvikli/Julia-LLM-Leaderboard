It then extracts the text within these sections and returns it as a tuple. The `strip()` function is used to remove any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\nYou can test this function with the following example:\n\n```python\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Some other section\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n\n# Question\n\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\n# Answer\n\nThe meaning of life is 42.\n\n# Another section\n\nVestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae; Donec velit neque, auctor sit amet aliquam vel, ullamcorper sit amet ligula.\n\"\"\"\n\nquestion, answer = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprint(f\"Question: {question}\")\nprint(f\"Answer: {answer}\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nQuestion: What is the meaning of life?\nAnswer: The meaning of life is 42.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[94,504],"elapsed":11.149074917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
