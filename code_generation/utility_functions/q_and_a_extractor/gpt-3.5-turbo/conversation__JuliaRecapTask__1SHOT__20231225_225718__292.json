[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Then we can extract the text between these sections and return it as a tuple.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this task:\n\n1. Define the function `q_and_a_extractor` that takes in a markdown text `md` as input.\n2. Use the regular expression `r\"(?s)# Question(.*?)\\n# Answer(.*?)(?=^#|$)\"` to find all matches of the question and answer sections.\n   - `(?s)` enables the \"dot-all\" mode, so that the dot (`.`) matches any character, including newlines.\n   - `(.*?)` matches any character (non-greedy) and captures it in a group.\n   - `\\n# Answer` matches a newline character followed by the substring \"# Answer\".\n   - `(.*?)(?=^#|$)` matches any character (non-greedy) until it encounters either the start of a new question section (marked by `#`) or the end of the input string.\n3. Iterate over the matches and extract the captured groups.\n4. Trim any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text using the `strip` function.\n5. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nNow let's implement this plan in the `q_and_a_extractor` function:","status":200,"tokens":[348,296],"elapsed":3.886241084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
