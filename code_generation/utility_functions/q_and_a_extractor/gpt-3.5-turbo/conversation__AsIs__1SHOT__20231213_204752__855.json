The `re.search()` method is used to find the first occurrence of the pattern `# Question`, followed by any text (non-greedy match), and then `# Answer`. The `re.DOTALL` flag is used to match across multiple lines.\n\nThe extracted text is then stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip()` method before returning it as a tuple `(question, answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[88,195],"elapsed":4.278689458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
