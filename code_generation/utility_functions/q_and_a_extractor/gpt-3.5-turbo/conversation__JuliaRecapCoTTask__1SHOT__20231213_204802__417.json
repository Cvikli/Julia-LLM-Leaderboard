[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Use the `split` function to split the `md` string by the substring `\"# Question\"` and `\"# Answer\"`. This will give us an array of substrings where each substring represents a section of the markdown text.\n2. Use indexing to extract the first element from the array, which corresponds to the question section. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted question.\n3. Use indexing to extract the second element from the array, which corresponds to the answer section. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted answer.\n4. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    sections = split(md, [\"# Question\", \"# Answer\"])\n    question = strip(sections[2])\n    answer = strip(sections[3])\n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nLet's test it with an example:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\n\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\n\\nParis\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThe function should return the tuple `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"Paris\")`.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can help you with!","status":200,"tokens":[349,300],"elapsed":7.401802,"_type":"aimessage"}]
