Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    question = \"\"\n    answer = \"\"\n    in_question = false\n    in_answer = false\n    \n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    for line in lines\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            in_question = true\n            in_answer = false\n            continue\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            in_question = false\n            in_answer = true\n            continue\n        end\n        \n        if in_question\n            question *= strip(line)\n        elseif in_answer\n            answer *= strip(line)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing in the markdown text as an argument, like this:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"\"\"\n# Question\nThis is the question.\n\n# Answer\nThis is the answer.\n\"\"\"\n\n(question, answer) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\nprintln(\"Question: \", question)\nprintln(\"Answer: \", answer)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nQuestion: This is the question.\nAnswer: This is the answer.\n```\n\nNote that the function assumes that the markdown sections \"Question\" and \"Answer\" are always present and in the correct order. If the markdown text does not follow this structure, the function may not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[91,288],"elapsed":5.966809042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
