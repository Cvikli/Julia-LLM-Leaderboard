Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nq_and_a_extractor(\"# Question\nWhat is the capital of France?\n\n# Answer\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\")","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nTo solve this task, we can follow the following steps:\n\n1. Split the input text into lines using the `split` function.\n2. Find the lines that start with `# Question` and `# Answer` using the `startswith` function.\n3. Extract the text following these lines.\n4. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n5. Return the extracted question and answer as a tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\")\n    question_line = nothing\n    answer_line = nothing\n    for (i, line) in enumerate(lines)\n        if startswith(line, \"# Question\")\n            question_line = i\n        elseif startswith(line, \"# Answer\")\n            answer_line = i\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if isnothing(question_line) || isnothing(answer_line) || question_line >= answer_line\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    question = strip(join(lines[question_line+1:answer_line-1]))\n    answer = strip(join(lines[answer_line+1:end]))\n    \n    (question, answer)\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function using the provided data:\n\n```julia\nmd = \"# Question\\nWhat is the capital of France?\\n\\n# Answer\\nThe capital of France is Paris.\\n\"\nq_and_a_extractor(md)\n```\n\nThe expected output is `(\"What is the capital of France?\", \"The capital of France is Paris.\")`","status":200,"tokens":[208,323],"elapsed":8.252508959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
