Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

The `DOTALL` flag allows the dot `.` to match newline characters as well. Finally, the extracted text is stripped of leading spaces and newlines using the `strip` function before being returned.","status":200,"tokens":[126,239],"elapsed":4.486278334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
