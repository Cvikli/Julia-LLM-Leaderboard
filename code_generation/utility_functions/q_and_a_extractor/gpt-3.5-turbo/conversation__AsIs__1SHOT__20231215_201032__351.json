The `re.search` function is used with the `re.DOTALL` flag to match any character, including newlines.\n\nThe regular expressions `r'# Question\\n(.+?)\\n\\n'` and `r'# Answer\\n(.+?)\\n\\n'` are used to match the question and answer sections respectively. The `(.+?)` captures any text between the section header and the next double newline.\n\nIf both the question and answer sections are found, the function returns a tuple containing the stripped question and answer. If either section is not found, the function returns `None`.","status":200,"tokens":[88,245],"elapsed":5.959389042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
