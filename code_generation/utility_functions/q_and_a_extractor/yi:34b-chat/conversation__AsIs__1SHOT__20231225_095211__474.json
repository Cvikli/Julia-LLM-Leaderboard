For each question and answer section, it accumulates the lines in lists until the next section begins, then concatenates those lists with newline characters to preserve formatting.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested questions or answers (i.e., a `# Question` or `# Answer` within another question or answer). If such structures exist in your markdown text, you would need to modify the function to handle them properly.","status":200,"tokens":[101,546],"elapsed":73.644367833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
