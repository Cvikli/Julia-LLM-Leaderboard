Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.

When a new section starts, it resets the state and continues processing the lines. The stripped text for each section is then joined back together with newlines.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that there are no nested sections (i.e., one `# Question` followed by one `# Answer` without any other headers in between). If your markdown contains more complex structures, you might need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[104,390],"elapsed":52.847295292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
