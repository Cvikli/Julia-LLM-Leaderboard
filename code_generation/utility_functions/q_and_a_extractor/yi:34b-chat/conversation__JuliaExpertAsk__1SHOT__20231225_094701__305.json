It uses a state machine to track whether it's in the question or answer section, appending text to the corresponding variable as it iterates over each line in the markdown text. After processing all lines, it ensures that both the question and answer are present and strips leading whitespace and newlines from the extracted texts before returning them in a tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[143,451],"elapsed":62.909961,"_type":"aimessage"}]
