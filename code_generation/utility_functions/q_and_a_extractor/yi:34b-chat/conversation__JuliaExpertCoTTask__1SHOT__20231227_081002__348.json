It then splits the markdown text into separate sections based on blank lines and filters out any sections that do not contain either a question or an answer. Finally, it strips leading whitespace from both the questions and answers before returning them as tuples.","status":200,"tokens":[244,254],"elapsed":60.404554167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
