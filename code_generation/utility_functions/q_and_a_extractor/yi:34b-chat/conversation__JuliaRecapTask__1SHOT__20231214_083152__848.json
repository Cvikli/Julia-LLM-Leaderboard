Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`.

Let's break down the problem into smaller steps and solve it systematically using the Julia language.\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n\n* Variables `x = 10` for storing variables\n* Control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y` for conditional statements\n* Functions `function f(x) end` and anonymous functions `x -> x^2` for defining functions\n* Arrays `[1, 2, 3]` and slicing `a[1:2]` for working with arrays\n* Tuples `(1, 2)` and namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )` for creating tuples\n* Dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)` for storing data in a dictionary\n* `$` for string interpolation\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe need to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. First, read the given Markdown text into a string using `readmarkdown`.\n2. Next, use regular expressions to extract the text from each markdown section. For example, you can use `Regex` package to match `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then use capturing groups to extract the text inside these sections. Here's an example code snippet:\n```julia\nusing Regex\n\n# Extract text from Markdown sections\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Match `# Question` and `# Answer`\n    q_pattern = \"# Question\"\n    answer_pattern = \"# Answer\"\n    re = RegEx(q_pattern, \"m\")\n    q_matches = re.match(md)\n    answer_matches = re.match(answer_pattern, md)\n    \n    # Extract text from each match\n    q_text = nothing\n    answer_text = nothing\n    for q in q_matches\n        q_text = q.group()\n    end\n    for a in answer_matches\n        answer_text = a.group()\n    end\n    \n    # Return answer tuple\n    return (q_text, answer_text)\nend\n```\n1. Now, use the `split` function to split each text into an array of strings. For example:\n```julia\n# Split text into an array of strings\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Extract text from Markdown sections\n    (q_text, answer_text) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    \n    # Split each text into an array of strings\n    q_array = split(q_text, \" \")\n    answer_array = split(answer_text, \" \")\n    \n    return (q_array, answer_array)\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nTo double-check that the solution is correct, we can add some additional checks and error handling. For example:\n\n1. Check that the extracted text does not contain any leading or trailing spaces:\n```julia\n# Check for leading/trailing spaces in extracted text\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::String)\n    # Extract text from Markdown sections\n    (q_text, answer_text) = q_and_a_extractor(md)\n    \n    # Check for leading/trailing spaces in each text\n    for q in q_array\n        if startswith(q, \" \") || endswith(q, \" \")\n            error(\"Extra spaces found in question text\")\n        end\n    end\n    for a in answer_array\n        if startswith(a, \" \") || endswith(a, \" \")\n            error(\"Extra spaces found in answer text\")\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (q_array, answer_array)\nend\n```\nBy following this systematic approach, we can write a Julia function that extracts the text from markdown sections and returns it in a tuple like `(question,answer)`.","status":200,"tokens":[399,933],"elapsed":40.148554292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
