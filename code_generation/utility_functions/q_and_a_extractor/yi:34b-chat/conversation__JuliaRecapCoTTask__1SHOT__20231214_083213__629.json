X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a markdown-formatted text `md`. Write a function `q_and_a_extractor` to extract all text in the markdown sections Question and Answer (starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, respectively) and return the answer in a tuple like `(question,answer)`. Strip any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! I'm ready to help you with your Julia language problem. Based on the information provided, here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `split()` for splitting a string into an array of substrings\n\t* `strftime()` for formatting dates and times\n\t* `Map()` and `Reduce()` for applying a function to each element of an array\n\t* `filter()` for filtering out elements from an array based on a condition\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Use `split()` to split the markdown text into an array of substrings, where each substring represents a line of the markdown text.\n\t* Use `strftime()` to format the dates and times in the markdown text into a consistent format.\n\t* Use `Map()` and `Reduce()` to apply a function to each line of the markdown text, which will extract the question and answer from each line. The function should take a line as input, and return a tuple containing the question and answer of that line.\n\t* Use `filter()` to filter out lines that do not contain either a `# Question` or a `# Answer`.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Use `println()` to print out each line of the extracted markdown text, to ensure that it matches what was expected.\n\t* Use `isequal()` to compare the extracted questions and answers with the original markdown text, to ensure that they are identical.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the `q_and_a_extractor` function:\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Split the markdown text into an array of substrings\n    lines = split(md, \"\\n\");\n    \n    # Format dates and times in a consistent format\n    formatted_lines = map(line -> strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\", line), lines);\n    \n    # Extract questions and answers from each line\n    extracted_qandas = reduce(line -> tuple(split(line, \"#\")[:2]), formatted_lines);\n    \n    # Filter out lines that do not contain either a question or answer\n    qandas = filter(line -> contains(line, \"# Question\"), extracted_qandas);\n    \n    # Return the extracted questions and answers\n    return qandas;\nend\n```\nI hope this helps!
