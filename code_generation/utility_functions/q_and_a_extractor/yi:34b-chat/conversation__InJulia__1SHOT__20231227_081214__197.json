It uses regular expressions to find the sections starting with `# Question` and `# Answer`, and then strips any leading spaces and newlines from the extracted text:\n\n```julia\nfunction q_and_a_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expressions for matching questions and answers\n    question_re = Regex(\"^# Question(?:\\\\s|\\\\n)(.*)\", \"m\")\n    answer_re = Regex(\"^# Answer(?:\\\\s|\\\\n)(.*)\", \"m\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty tuple to store the results\n    results = Tuple{String, String}()\n\n    # Loop through the markdown text and extract questions and answers\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if match(question_re, line) !== nothing\n            question = strip(match(question_re, line)[1])\n        elseif match(answer_re, line) !== nothing\n            answer = strip(match(answer_re, line)[1])\n            # If both question and answer have been found, add to the tuple\n            if question != \"\"\n                push!(results, (question, answer))\n            end\n        else\n            # If we're not at the start of a new section, append to the current answer\n            if answer != \"\"\n                answer *= \"\\n\" * strip(line)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return results\nend\n```\n\nThis function will return a tuple of strings where each element is a pair of question and answer. If you only want the answers without the questions, you can modify the function to extract only the answers:\n\n```julia\nfunction answer_extractor(md::AbstractString)\n    # Regular expression for matching answers\n    answer_re = Regex(\"^# Answer(?:\\\\s|\\\\n)(.*)\", \"m\")\n\n    # Initialize an empty vector to store the results\n    answers = String[]\n\n    # Loop through the markdown text and extract answers\n    for line in eachline(md)\n        if match(answer_re, line) !== nothing\n            answer = strip(match(answer_re, line)[1])\n            push!(answers, answer * \"\\n\")\n        end\n    end\n\n    return answers\nend\n```\n\nThis second function will return a vector of strings containing only the answers.","status":200,"tokens":[104,574],"elapsed":77.082731125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
