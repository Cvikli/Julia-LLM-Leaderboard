If it is, it returns `\"No events\"` immediately. This is to avoid sorting an empty list or trying to check for overlapping events when there are none.\n*   The sorted_events variable holds a copy of the event_list, but sorted in ascending order by start time using `sort`. Julia's built-in `sort` function takes a keyword argument `by`, which allows us to specify the sorting criteria. Here, we sort by x[1] to sort based on the first element (start time) of each event tuple.\n*   We iterate through sorted_events, comparing each event's start and end times with the previous event's end time. If an event starts before the previous one ends, there is a conflict. If not, we update prev_end to the current event's end time for comparison during the next iteration.\n*   If no conflicts are found after iterating through all events in sorted_events, `\"No conflicts\"` is returned as the result of `event_scheduler`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,507],"elapsed":27.234757983,"_type":"aimessage"}]
