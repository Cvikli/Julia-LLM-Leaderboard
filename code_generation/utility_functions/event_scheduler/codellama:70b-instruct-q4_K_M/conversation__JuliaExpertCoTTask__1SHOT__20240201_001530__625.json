Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code for this task:\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    events = sort(events, by=first)\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        if Date(events[i+1][1]) < Date(events[i][2])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis code first checks whether the list of events is empty. If it is, then it returns \"No events\". If not, it sorts the events based on their start times (ascending order) and uses a for loop to iterate through all events. It converts each event's dates into the `Date` type using the `Dates` package. For each pair of consecutive events, if the start time of the next event is earlier than or equal to the finish time of the previous event, then there is an overlap and a conflict exists. If no overlapping times are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":13.334927777,"_type":"aimessage"}]
