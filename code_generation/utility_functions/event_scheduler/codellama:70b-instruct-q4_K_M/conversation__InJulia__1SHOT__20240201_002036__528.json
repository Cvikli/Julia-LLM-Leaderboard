It begins by checking for an empty event_list; if it's empty, it returns \"No events.\" If there are any items in the list, it uses the sort() function to order them by their start times (the first values in each tuple). This is necessary because we need to compare end times with subsequent start times.\n\nOnce the list has been sorted, the for loop begins. It starts at index 2 (instead of index 1) because there's nothing to compare with at that point; it's comparing subsequent events. Each iteration checks if the next event's start time is earlier than or equal to the previous event's end time. If this condition is met, it returns \"Conflict,\" indicating an overlap has been found.\n\nIf the for loop completes without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\" to indicate that all events can be scheduled without conflict.","status":200,"tokens":[0,361],"elapsed":19.323628559,"_type":"aimessage"}]
