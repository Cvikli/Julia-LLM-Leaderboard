[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If no overlapping events are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". The sorted_events variable holds the events in a list after they've been sorted by start time. The last_end_time variable is initialized with the finish time of the first event and then updated to the end time of each subsequent event as the loop runs through each event. For each iteration, it checks if the current event starts before the previous event ends (which indicates an overlap) and returns \"Conflict\" if it does. Otherwise, it moves on to the next event in the sorted list. If no overlapping events are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,622],"elapsed":33.789983581,"_type":"aimessage"}]
