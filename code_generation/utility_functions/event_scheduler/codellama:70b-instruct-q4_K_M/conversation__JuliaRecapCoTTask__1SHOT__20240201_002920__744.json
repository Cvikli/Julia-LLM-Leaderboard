[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The function `event_scheduler` takes a vector of tuples (`events`) where each tuple represents an event with its start and finish times. It returns a string indicating whether there are any scheduling conflicts or not.\n2. First, we check if the list of events is empty. If so, we return `\"No events\"`. This is to handle the edge case where there are no events in the list.\n3. Next, we sort the events by their start times using `sort!` with a custom comparison function that compares two tuples based on their first elements (i.e., start time). This is to ensure that we can efficiently check for conflicts by iterating through the sorted events from earliest to latest starting times.\n4. We then iterate over the sorted list of events, starting from the second event (since we already handled the first event during sorting). For each event `i`, we check if its start time is earlier than the previous event's finish time (`prev_finish`). If so, there is a scheduling conflict and we return `\"Conflict\"`.\n5. If no conflicts are found, we return `\"No conflicts\"` indicating that all events can be scheduled without any overlaps.","status":200,"tokens":[0,613],"elapsed":33.289508202,"_type":"aimessage"}]
