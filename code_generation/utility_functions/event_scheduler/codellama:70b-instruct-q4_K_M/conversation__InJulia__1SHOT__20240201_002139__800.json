Each event is represented by a tuple with the start and end time.\n*   We first check if the input list is empty, returning `\"No events\"` if it is.\n*   Then we sort the events by their start time using Julia's `sort()` function with a custom comparison (`lt`) operator to compare the first elements of each tuple (the start times). This ensures that the events are sorted chronologically.\n*   We iterate through all pairs of consecutive events, starting from the second event (index 1), and check if their end time is greater than the next event's start time. If we find a conflict, we return `\"Conflict\"`.\n*   Otherwise, we return `\"No conflicts\"` when there are no overlapping events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,416],"elapsed":22.326345073,"_type":"aimessage"}]
