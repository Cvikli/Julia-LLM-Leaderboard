Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution in Julia using the Dates package:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(event::Array{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(event)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    sort!(event, by=x -> parse(DateTime, x[1])) # sort by start time\n    for i in 2:length(event)\n        last_finish = event[i-1][2]\n        current_start = event[i][1]\n        if parse(DateTime, current_start) < parse(DateTime, last_finish)\n            return \"Conflict\" # events overlap\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"  # no overlapping events\nend\n```\nIn the solution above, we use the `parse` function to convert strings representing times into Julia's built-in DateTime type. The Dates package provides methods for comparing and manipulating DateTimes. We can use these features to detect if any events overlap in time.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":12.937520341,"_type":"aimessage"}]
