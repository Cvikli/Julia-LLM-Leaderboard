Then, we create a set of all unique dates within the event list. The elements of this set are determined by converting each date in the `event_list` into a `Date` format using the function `Dates.Date()`.\n\nNext, for every day in the `date_set`, we filter out only those events that occur on that particular day. We do this by comparing the date of each event to the current `d`.\n\nIf there are more than one events occurring on a given day, we sort them based on their finish times. The sorting is done in descending order because we want to prioritize events with earlier finish times. This way, if any conflicts occur, they will be detected as soon as possible.\n\nAfter sorting the events, we iterate through each pair of adjacent events and check if there are any time overlaps by comparing their start and end times. If an overlap is found, the function returns `\"Conflict\"`.\n\nIf no conflicts are found after going through all dates in the `date_set`, the function returns `\"No conflicts\"` to indicate that there are no scheduling conflicts among the events.","status":200,"tokens":[0,603],"elapsed":32.467857937,"_type":"aimessage"}]
