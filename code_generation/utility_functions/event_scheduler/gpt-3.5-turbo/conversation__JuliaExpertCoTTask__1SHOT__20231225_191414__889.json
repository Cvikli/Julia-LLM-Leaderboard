Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Approach\n\nTo solve this task, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the list of events is empty. If it is, return \"No events\".\n2. Sort the list of events by the start time.\n3. Iterate over the sorted list of events and compare the finish time of each event with the start time of the next event.\n4. If the finish time of any event is greater than or equal to the start time of the next event, return \"Conflict\".\n5. If we have reached the end of the list without finding any conflicts, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nLet's write the code now.","status":200,"tokens":[255,127],"elapsed":2.471634708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
