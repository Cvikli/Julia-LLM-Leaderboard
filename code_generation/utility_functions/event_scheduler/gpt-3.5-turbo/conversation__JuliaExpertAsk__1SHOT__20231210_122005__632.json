Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return 'No conflicts' if there are no overlapping events and 'Conflict' if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return 'No events'. Use package Dates for parsing. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events)\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i-1][2] > sorted_events[i][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2021-12-12 08:30\", \"2021-12-12 09:30\"), (\"2021-12-12 09:00\", \"2021-12-12 10:00\"), (\"2021-12-12 11:00\", \"2021-12-12 12:00\")]\n\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nConflict\n```\n\nIn this example, there is a conflict between the second and third events since they overlap in time. So the `event_scheduler` function returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[150,225],"elapsed":6.56597025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
