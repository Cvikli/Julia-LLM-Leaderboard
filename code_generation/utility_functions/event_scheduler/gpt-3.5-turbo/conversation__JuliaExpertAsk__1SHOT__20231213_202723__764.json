Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> x[1])\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        start_time = DateTime(sorted_events[i][1], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n        end_time = DateTime(sorted_events[i][2], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n        \n        prev_end_time = DateTime(sorted_events[i-1][2], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n        \n        if start_time <= prev_end_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function takes a list of event tuples as input. It first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if so. Next, it sorts the events based on their start time.\n\nThen, it iterates over the sorted list of events starting from the second event. For each event, it converts the start and end time strings into `DateTime` objects using the provided format. It also retrieves the end time of the previous event.\n\nIf the start time of the current event is less than or equal to the end time of the previous event, then there is a scheduling conflict. In this case, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found after iterating through all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,300],"elapsed":7.402041042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
