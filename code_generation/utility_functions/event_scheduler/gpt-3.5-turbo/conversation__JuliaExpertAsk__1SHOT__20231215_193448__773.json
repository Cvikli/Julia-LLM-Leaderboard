Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i][2] >= sorted_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\".\n- The list of events is then sorted based on the start time of each event.\n- The function then iterates through the sorted list of events and checks if the finish time of the current event is greater than or equal to the start time of the next event. If it is, there is a conflict and the function returns \"Conflict\".\n- If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,199],"elapsed":4.15382275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
