Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> Dates.datetime(x[1]))\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] < sorted_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- First, we check if the `events` list is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\" as requested.\n- We then sort the `events` list based on the start time of each event using the `sort` function and the `by` keyword argument. This will ensure that the events are ordered chronologically.\n- Next, we iterate through the sorted events starting from the second event. For each event, we compare its start time with the end time of the previous event. If the start time of the current event is less than the end time of the previous event, it means there is a conflict and we return \"Conflict\".\n- If we complete the loop without finding any conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[146,243],"elapsed":3.8252265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
