Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return 'No conflicts' if there are no overlapping events and 'Conflict' if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return 'No events'. Use package Dates for parsing. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I would follow the following steps:\n\n1. If the list of events is empty, return 'No events'.\n2. Convert the start and end times of each event from strings to `DateTime` objects using the `parse` function from the `Dates` package.\n3. Sort the list of events based on their start times in ascending order.\n4. Iterate over the sorted list of events and compare the end time of each event with the start time of the next event.\n5. If the end time of any event is greater than or equal to the start time of the next event, return 'Conflict'.\n6. If the loop completes without finding any conflicts, return 'No conflicts'.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    events = [(parse(DateTime, start), parse(DateTime, end)) for (start, end) in events]\n    events = sort(events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        if events[i][2] >= events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nNow we can test it with the provided example:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThe result should be:\n\n```\n\"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[225,345],"elapsed":9.390409625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
