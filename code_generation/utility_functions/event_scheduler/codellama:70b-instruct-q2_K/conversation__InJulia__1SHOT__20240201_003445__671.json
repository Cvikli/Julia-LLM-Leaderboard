[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

We then sort these dates to check if they are in chronological order. If the sorted indices of the starting times are different from those of the ending times, there must be overlapping events, so we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, we have no conflicts and can return \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, we return \"No events\" as appropriate.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":11.780474763,"_type":"aimessage"}]
