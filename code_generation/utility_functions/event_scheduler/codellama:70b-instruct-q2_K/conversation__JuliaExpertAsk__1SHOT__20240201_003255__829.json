Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The `event_scheduler` function takes a list of tuples as input and returns either \"No conflicts\" or \"Conflict\", depending on whether there are any overlapping events.

By iterating through each event, we can check if the current event's start time is before or equal to the previous event's finish time. If it does, there is an overlap and a conflict occurs. If no overlaps are found, \"No conflicts\" is returned as the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":12.161459964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
