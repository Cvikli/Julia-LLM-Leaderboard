[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Each event is a tuple containing a start time and a finish time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. We use the `Dates` package for parsing these strings into DateTime objects.\n\nInside the function, we check if the list is empty; if so, we return \"No events\". If there are events, we initialize an `active_events` dictionary to keep track of which events are currently active (i.e., their start time has not passed).\n\nFor each event in the list, we check if its start time is already present in the dictionary. If it's a new start time, we add it to the dictionary with an empty array as its value. If the start time is already present, it means that this is a continuation of an existing event, so we append the finish time to the corresponding array in the dictionary.\n\nWe then loop through each active finish time and check for conflicts by comparing the finish times of all events against each other. If a conflict is found, we return \"Conflict\". Since no conflicts were found in this example, the function will return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[434,684],"elapsed":102.185295042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
