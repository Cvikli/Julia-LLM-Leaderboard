It sorts the events by their start times using the `Date` constructor to parse the dates, and then iterates through the list, checking for conflicts between each event and the previous one. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\". If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,296],"elapsed":41.670352709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
