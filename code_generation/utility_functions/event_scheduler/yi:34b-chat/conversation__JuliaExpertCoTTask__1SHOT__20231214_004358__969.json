If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n* We sort the events by their start time to ensure consistent comparison.\n* We then iterate over each event in the list and check if the current event overlaps with any previously scheduled events. If there are any conflicts, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n* Finally, we test the function with some sample data to demonstrate its behavior.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input events are in the format of a tuple containing the start and finish times (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). If your input data has a different format, you may need to modify the `parse` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[300,457],"elapsed":18.715868125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
