Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then iterates through the list, checking for any overlap between each event's start time and the end times of subsequent events. If there is a conflict, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,283],"elapsed":40.108770125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
