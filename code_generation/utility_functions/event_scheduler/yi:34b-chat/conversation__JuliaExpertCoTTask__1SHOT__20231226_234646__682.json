Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Approach\n\n1. Define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events as input.\n2. For each event, parse the start and finish times using Dates.\n3. Iterate over the list of events, checking for conflicts by comparing the start and finish times of each event with the current event's start and finish times.\n4. If there is a conflict, return \"Conflict\"; otherwise, continue to the next event.\n5. Once all events have been checked, if no conflicts were found, return \"No conflicts\".\n6. Handle the case where the list of events is empty by returning \"No events\".\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 2:length(events)\n        current_event = events[i]\n        previous_events = events[1:(i - 1)]\n\n        # Check for conflicts with previous events\n        for prev_event in previous_events\n            if occursin(prev_event..., current_event...) || occursin(current_event..., prev_event...)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage with provided data\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n# Verification\n\nTo verify the function's behavior, we can run it with the provided data and expected output:\n\n```julia\nexpected_output = \"Conflict\"\nactual_output = event_scheduler(events)\n\n@assert actual_output == expected_output \"Function output should be 'Conflict' but is '$actual_output'\"\n```\n\nThis will assert that the function correctly returns \"Conflict\" when given the provided events.","status":200,"tokens":[313,516],"elapsed":97.387204667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
