Each event is a tuple with two string dates in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. The function uses the `Dates` package to parse these strings into actual dates and times. It then checks for conflicts by comparing the start time of each event with the end times of all subsequent events. If any overlap is found, the function returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[313,415],"elapsed":61.031394417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
