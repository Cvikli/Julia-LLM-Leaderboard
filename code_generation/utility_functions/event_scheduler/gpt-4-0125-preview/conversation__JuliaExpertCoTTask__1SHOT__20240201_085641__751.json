Think through your approach step by step.\n2. Write the required function and other necessary code.\n3. Implement the solution, and test it with the provided data.\n4. Validate that the solution correctly identifies overlapping events.\n\n### Step 1: Approach\n- Convert each event's start and finish times to DateTime objects using the Dates package in Julia.\n- Sort the events based on their start times.\n- Loop through the sorted events comparing the end time of the current event with the start time of the next event.\n- If the end time of an event is greater than the start time of the next event, we have a conflict.\n- If we get through all events without finding a conflict, we conclude there are no scheduling conflicts.\n- If no events are provided, return \"No events\".\n\n### Step 2: Writing the Function\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Convert event times to DateTime objects and sort\n    formatted_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sort!(formatted_events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    for i in 1:length(formatted_events)-1\n        if formatted_events[i][2] > formatted_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([\n    (\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"),\n    (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")\n])\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check the Solution\n\nFor the given example data, there are no overlapping events, thus we expect the function to output \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[255,421],"elapsed":39.5327225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
