Here's a function `event_scheduler` in Julia that performs the required checks using the Dates package:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        event1 = events[i]\n        start1 = DateTime(event1[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        end1 = DateTime(event1[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            event2 = events[j]\n            start2 = DateTime(event2[1], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            end2 = DateTime(event2[2], \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n            \n            if (start1 <= start2 <= end1) || (start1 <= end2 <= end1) || (start2 <= start1 <= end2) || (start2 <= end1 <= end2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nExample of usage:\n```julia\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-10-15 08:00\", \"2023-10-15 12:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-15 13:00\", \"2023-10-15 15:00\"),\n    (\"2023-10-15 11:00\", \"2023-10-15 14:00\")\n]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output will be \"Conflict\"\n```\n\nIn this example, there is a conflict between the second and third events.","status":200,"tokens":[115,351],"elapsed":5.050502875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
