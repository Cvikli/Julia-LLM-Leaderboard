Here's a function `event_scheduler`  in Julia that checks for scheduling conflicts among the events:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x->x[1])\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if DateTime(sorted_events[i][2],\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\") > DateTime(sorted_events[i+1][1],\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this `event_scheduler` function and pass a list of events, each represented as a tuple with a start and finish time. The function will then return \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time, \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, or \"No events\" if the list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[108,193],"elapsed":2.631158208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
