Here's a function `event_scheduler` in Julia that checks for scheduling conflicts among the events:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> Dates.datetime(x[1]) )\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if Dates.datetime(sorted_events[i][2]) > Dates.datetime(sorted_events[i+1][1])\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `event_scheduler` function:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-01-01 08:00\", \"2022-01-01 10:00\"),\n          (\"2022-01-01 09:30\", \"2022-01-01 11:00\"),\n          (\"2022-01-01 12:00\", \"2022-01-01 13:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: \"Conflict\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `event_scheduler` will return \"Conflict\" as there is a scheduling conflict between the second and third events.","status":200,"tokens":[112,264],"elapsed":4.605597833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
