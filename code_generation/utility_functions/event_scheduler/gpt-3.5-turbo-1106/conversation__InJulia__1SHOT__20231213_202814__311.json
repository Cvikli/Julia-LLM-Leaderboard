[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If the list is empty, it will return \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[111,307],"elapsed":4.725459542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
