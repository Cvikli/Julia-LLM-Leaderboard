Import necessary packages: In this case, we'll need the Dates package for parsing date and time strings.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```\n\n2. Define the event_scheduler function with a parameter `events` which is an array of tuples containing start and end times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Function body goes here\nend\n```\n\n3. Initialize variables to store the results, list of event durations, and a flag for checking conflicts.\n\n```julia\nconflict = false\nevent_durations = Dates.DateTime[]\n```\n\n4. Convert start and end times from string format to DateTime objects using the `parse` function from the Dates package.\n\n5. Loop through the events and add their durations (end time - start time) to our list of event durations.\n\n```julia\nfor (start_time, end_time) in events\n    start = Dates.parse(Dates.DateTime, \"$start_time\")\n    end_time = Dates.parse(Dates.DateTime, \"$end_time\")\n    event_duration = (end_time - start)\n    push!(event_durations, event_duration)\nend\n```\n\n6. Check for overlaps in the list of event durations. If any overlapping time ranges are found, set `conflict` to `true`.\n\n```julia\nfor i = 1:(length(event_durations)-1)\n    if (event_durations[i] + Dates.Day(0,1) <= event_durations[i+1])\n        conflict = true\n        break\n    end\nend\n```\n\n7. After checking for conflicts, return the appropriate message based on the `conflict` flag value and check for an empty list of events:\n\n```julia\nif isempty(events)\n    return \"No events\"\nelseif conflict\n    return \"Conflict\"\nelse\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[128,511],"elapsed":30.515481791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
