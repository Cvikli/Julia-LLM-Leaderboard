If not, it returns \"No events\". It then uses a set to keep track of unique start and end times of events within the given list. For every event, it calculates its duration by subtracting the finish time from the start time.\n\nThe function checks for overlapping events by comparing each event's start and end times with all other event times. If there is any overlap, it returns \"Conflict\" immediately and stops iterating through the remaining events. Otherwise, if no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[125,428],"elapsed":25.622788083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
