Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To write the `event_sorter` function as described in the problem statement, I'll follow the given problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n   - First, I will write a helper function `parse_date` to parse strings with the given date and time format using the `Dates` package.\n   - Then, I will write the `event_scheduler` function, which will sort the events based on their start time and check for any conflicts.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\n```julia using Dates\n\nfunction parse_date(date_str::AbstractString)\n    parts = split(date_str, ' ')\n    year, month, day = map(parse, parts[1:3])\n    hour, minute = map(parse, parts[4:5])\n    return DateTime(year, month, day, hour, minute)\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}})\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, lt = (a, b) -> a[1] < b[1])\n\n    for (_, prev_event) in pairs(sorted_events)\n        if prev_event[2] > sorted_events[1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\nThe output should be \"Conflict\" since the second event (11:30 to 12:30) starts right after the first event (09:00 to 11:00).","status":200,"tokens":[309,473],"elapsed":9.96646425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
