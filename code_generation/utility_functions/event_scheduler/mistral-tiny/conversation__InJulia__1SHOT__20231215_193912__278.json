Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

You can do this by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```\n\nNow, let's write the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = x -> parse(DateTime, x[1]))\n\n    current_time = parse(DateTime, sorted_events[1][1])\n\n    for event in sorted_events\n        start_time = parse(DateTime, event[1])\n        finish_time = parse(DateTime, event[2])\n\n        if current_time > finish_time\n            current_time = start_time\n        else if current_time >= start_time && current_time < finish_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of tuples as an argument, where each tuple represents an event with a start and finish time. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. It then sorts the events based on their start times using the `sort!` function and the `parse` function from the `Dates` package. The function then iterates through the sorted events, updating the current time and checking for conflicts. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[121,388],"elapsed":3.380172041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
