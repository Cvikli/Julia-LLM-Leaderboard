It then initializes a boolean variable `conflicts` to false and iterates through the sorted events. If an event starts after the previous event ends or starts before it ends (non-overlapping), the loop continues. If there is an overlapping event, the `conflicts` variable is set to true, and the loop is broken. If any conflicts are detected, the function returns the string \"Conflict\". Otherwise, the function checks if the input list is empty, and if so, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[162,351],"elapsed":3.130705209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
