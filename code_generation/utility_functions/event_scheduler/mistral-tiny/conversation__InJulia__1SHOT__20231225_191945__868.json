You can do this by adding the following line at the beginning of your script:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```\n\nNext, define the `event_scheduler` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> x[1])\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        start_time, _ = sorted_events[i]\n        last_end_time, _ = sorted_events[i-1]\n        \n        if start_time <= last_end_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of tuples as an argument and checks for scheduling conflicts. It first sorts the events in ascending order based on their start times using the `sort` function and the `by` keyword. Then, it iterates through the sorted list of events, and for each event, it checks if its start time conflicts with the end time of the previous event. If there's a conflict, it returns the string \"Conflict\". If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the input vector is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[121,345],"elapsed":3.064250834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
