Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If not, you can install it using the following command in your Julia REPL:\n\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Dates\")\n```\n\nNow, you can write the `event_scheduler` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = x -> parse(DateTime, x[1]))\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        start_time, _ = sorted_events[i]\n        previous_end_time, _ = sorted_events[i-1]\n\n        if start_time <= previous_end_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector `events` of tuples as an argument, where each tuple represents an event with a start time and a finish time. The function first checks for empty input and returns \"No events\". It then sorts the events based on their start times using the `sort!` function from the `Algorithms` module.\n\nThe function then iterates through the sorted list of events, checking if each event starts before the previous event ends. If an event overlaps with the previous event, a scheduling conflict is detected and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[121,373],"elapsed":3.401763166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
