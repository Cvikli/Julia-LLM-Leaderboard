[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It returns either \"No conflicts\" or \"Conflict\", depending on whether there are any overlapping events.\n\nThe function uses two dictionaries to keep track of start times and finish times while iterating over the events. The `haskey!` method is used to check if a key already exists in the dictionary before adding it. If an event has overlapping start or finish times with another event, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it updates the dictionaries accordingly and returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the events are sorted by start time. If not, the order of the events in the list does not matter, as long as they are unique.","status":200,"tokens":[428,374],"elapsed":17.329891041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
