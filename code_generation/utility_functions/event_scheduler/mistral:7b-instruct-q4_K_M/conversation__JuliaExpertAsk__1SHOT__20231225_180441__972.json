Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It first checks if the dictionary is empty and returns \"No events\". Then it extracts all start and finish times into separate arrays. The function then finds any overlapping events using logical indexing with `findall`. If there are no overlapping events, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[161,243],"elapsed":10.319952875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
