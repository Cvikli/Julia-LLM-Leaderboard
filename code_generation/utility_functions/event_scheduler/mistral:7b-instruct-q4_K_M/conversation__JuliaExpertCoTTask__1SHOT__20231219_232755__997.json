First, we check if the input `events` is empty. If it is, we return a string indicating that there are no events.\n2. Next, we create a dictionary of event start times and their corresponding end times using the `Dict` type from the `Package.Types` package. We iterate over each event in the input list and add the start time to the dictionary.\n3. Then, we iterate over all the start times in the dictionary and check for any overlapping events. If there are no overlapping events, we return \"No conflicts\".\n4. If there are overlapping events, we push each overlapping start time onto an array called `conflicting_events`. Finally, we return a string indicating whether there are any conflicts or not.\n\nNote: The `Package.Types` package is part of the standard library in Julia, so you don't need to import it explicitly.","status":200,"tokens":[300,460],"elapsed":18.748029708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
