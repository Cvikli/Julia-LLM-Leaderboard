Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    conflicts = false\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start1, finish1 = parse(datetime, events[i][1])\n        start2, finish2 = parse(datetime, events[i+1][1])\n        \n        if (start1 <= finish2) && (finish1 >= start2)\n            conflicts = true\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return conflicts ? \"Conflict\" : \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe function first checks if the list is empty and returns an appropriate message. If not, it iterates over all pairs of events in the list and checks for any overlapping events using `parse(datetime, events[i][1])`. It then compares the start and finish times of each event to see if they overlap. If a conflict is found, it sets `conflicts` to true and breaks out of the loop. Finally, if no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[161,255],"elapsed":10.814787625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
