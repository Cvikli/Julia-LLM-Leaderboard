If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it loops through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent events for overlapping times. If any two events overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe implementation uses Python's built-in `datetime` module to parse the start and finish times from the input strings. The `strptime()` method is used to convert each string into a datetime object. The resulting objects are then compared using the `<` operator to check for overlapping times.","status":200,"tokens":[117,409],"elapsed":16.480798459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
