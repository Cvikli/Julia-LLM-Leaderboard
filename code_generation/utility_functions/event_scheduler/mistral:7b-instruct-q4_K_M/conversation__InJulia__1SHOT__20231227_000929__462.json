It then iterates through the events list and updates these dictionaries accordingly. Finally, it checks for any overlapping events by comparing the end time of one event with the start time of the next event in the `finish_times` dictionary. If there is an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[120,332],"elapsed":13.485172541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
