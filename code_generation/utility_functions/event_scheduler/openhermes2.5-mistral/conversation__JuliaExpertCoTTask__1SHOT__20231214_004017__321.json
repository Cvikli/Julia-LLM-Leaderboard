Here's my solution using the `Dates` package in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if there are any events\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Sort the events by start time\n    events = sort(events, by = x -> x.start)\n\n    # Find any overlapping events\n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        if events[i].start >= events[i-1].finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # No conflicts, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test the function with the given data\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nExplanation of the code:\n\n1. We start by checking if there are any events in the list. If there are no events, we return \"No events\".\n2. We sort the events by their start time using the `sort` function and the `by` argument to specify the comparison function. This ensures that the events are sorted in the correct order.\n3. We iterate through the events, checking if each event overlaps with the previous one. If there is an overlap, we return \"Conflict\".\n4. If there are no overlapping events, we return \"No conflicts\".\n5. Finally, we test the function with the given data and print the result.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the events are in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, which is what the `Dates` package uses by default for date parsing. If your events have a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[300,470],"elapsed":19.193278333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
