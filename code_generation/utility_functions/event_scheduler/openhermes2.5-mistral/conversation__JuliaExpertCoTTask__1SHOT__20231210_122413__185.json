Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return 'No conflicts' if there are no overlapping events and 'Conflict' if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return 'No events'. Use package Dates for parsing.

Here's my approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. First, I will create a list of all the events and their start and end times in a structured format.\n```julia\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-12-01\", 09, 00, 11, 00),\n    (\"2023-12-01\", 11, 30, 12, 30)\n]\n```\n2. Next, I will create a dictionary of all the events, where the keys are the event dates and the values are lists of the start and end times for each event.\n```julia\nevent_dict = Dict()\nfor e in events:\n    event_dict[e[\"date\"]] = [e[\"start\"], e[\"end\"]]\n```\n3. Now, I will loop through all the events and check if there are any overlapping times. If there are no conflicts, the function will return \"No conflicts\". If there are conflicts, it will return \"Conflict\".\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    no_conflicts = true\n    for e1 in events:\n        if e1[\"start\"] in events[:i][\"end\"] || e1[\"end\"] in events[i + 1:\"end\"]\n            no_conflicts = false\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    return no_conflicts ? \"No conflicts\" : \"Conflict\"\nend\n```\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis function will return \"No conflicts\".\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[271,473],"elapsed":18.775033292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
