Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return 'No conflicts' if there are no overlapping events and 'Conflict' if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return 'No events'. Use package Dates for parsing. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Understood! Here's a brief and concise solution to the problem:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler(events) =\n    if length(events) == 0\n        \"No events\"\n    else\n        for e1 in events\n            for e2 in events\n                if e1.start < e2.end && e1.start >= e2.start\n                    return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n        \"No conflicts\"\n    end\n```\nExamples:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-02-27 10:00\"), (\"2023-02-27 12:00\"), (\"2023-02-27 14:00\")]) # No conflicts\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-02-27 10:00\"), (\"2023-02-27 11:00\"), (\"2023-02-27 13:00\")]) # Conflict at 11:00\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-02-27 10:00\"), (\"2023-02-27 15:00\")]) # No conflicts\n```\nThe function works by iterating over the events in the list and checking for any overlapping time periods. If an overlap is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[141,359],"elapsed":12.973007583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
