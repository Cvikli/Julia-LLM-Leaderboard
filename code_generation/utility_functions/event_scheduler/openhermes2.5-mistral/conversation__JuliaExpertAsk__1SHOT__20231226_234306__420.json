Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that solves the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for (i, start_time1) in enumerate(events)\n        for (j, start_time2) in enumerate(events[i+1:end])\n            if isoverlapping(start_time1, events[i][2], start_time2, events[j][2])\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction isoverlapping(start_time1, finish_time1, start_time2, finish_time2)\n    return (finish_time1 >= start_time2 && finish_time1 <= finish_time2) || \n           (finish_time2 >= start_time1 && finish_time2 <= finish_time1)\nend\n```\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns \"No events\". Then it iterates over each event and checks if any other event overlaps with it. If an overlap is found, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, if no overlapping events were found, it returns \"No conflicts\". The `isoverlapping` function is a helper function that checks whether two time intervals (start_time1, finish_time1) and (start_time2, finish_time2) overlap or not.","status":200,"tokens":[167,351],"elapsed":11.480134833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
