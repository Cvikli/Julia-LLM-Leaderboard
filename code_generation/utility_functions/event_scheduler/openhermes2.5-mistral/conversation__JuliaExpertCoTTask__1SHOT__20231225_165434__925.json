Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

We can use the `Dates` package for this. Then we will compare each event's start time with the end time of all other events to check if they overlap. If there are any overlaps, we return \"Conflict\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step implementation:\n\n1. Import the Dates module.\n2. Define a function `event_scheduler`.\n3. Convert start and finish times into Dates.\n4. Iterate over events to check for overlapping events.\n5. Return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events or \"Conflict\" if there are any overlapping events. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".\n6. Test the function with the provided data.\n\nHere's the code:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    for (i, event1) in enumerate(events)\n        for (_, event2) in enumerate(events)\n            if i != j && \n               (event1[1] <= event2[2] && event1[2] >= event2[1]) || \n               (event2[1] <= event1[2] && event2[2] >= event1[1])\n                 return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\nNow, let's test the function with the provided data:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis will return \"Conflict\" as the first event overlaps with the second event.","status":200,"tokens":[314,470],"elapsed":15.965827667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
