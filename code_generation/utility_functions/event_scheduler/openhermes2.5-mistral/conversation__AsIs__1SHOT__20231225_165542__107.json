Then, for each event pair in the list, it compares the start and end times to see if they overlap. If there's any overlapping, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[123,313],"elapsed":9.906547292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
