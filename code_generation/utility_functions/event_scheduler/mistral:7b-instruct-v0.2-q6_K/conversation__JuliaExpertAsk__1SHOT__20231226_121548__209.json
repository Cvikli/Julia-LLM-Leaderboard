If there is an overlap between the current event's start or finish time with the previous event's end time, a conflict is detected. Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\" if all events can be scheduled without overlapping. If the input list is empty, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[160,320],"elapsed":17.874031167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
