Install the Dates package if it's not already installed by running `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Dates\")`.\n2. Define the `event_scheduler` function as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort(events, by=x->parse(\"$(x[1]) $(x[2])\", \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm\"))\n\n    previous_event::Union{Nothing, DateTime} = nothing\n\n    for current_event in sorted_events\n        if !isnothing(previous_event) && end(current_event) <= start(previous_event)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        \n        previous_event = current_event\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function accepts a vector of tuples containing event start and finish times. It uses the `sort` function with the `Dates.parse` function to sort events based on their start time. Then, it iterates through each event comparing its end time with the previous event's start time. If there is an overlap (i.e., current_event's end time is less than or equal to previous_event's start time), the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues iterating until all events have been checked.","status":200,"tokens":[119,357],"elapsed":19.7970455,"_type":"aimessage"}]
