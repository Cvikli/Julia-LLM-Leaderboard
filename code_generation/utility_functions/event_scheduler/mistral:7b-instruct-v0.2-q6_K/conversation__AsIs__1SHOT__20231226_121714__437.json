The function first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns \"No events\". It then sorts the events based on their start times. Then it iterates through the sorted events one by one and checks if the current time (which is set to the start time of the previous event or the first event) is less than the finish time of the current event. If it is, there is a conflict, and the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, the current time is updated to be the start time of the next event. If all events have been checked without finding any conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[116,328],"elapsed":18.061119042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
