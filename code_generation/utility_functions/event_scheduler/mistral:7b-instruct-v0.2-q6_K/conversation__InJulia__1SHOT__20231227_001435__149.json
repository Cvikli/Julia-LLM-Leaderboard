The function returns either \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events or \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". The function uses the Dates package for parsing dates and sorts the events based on their start times to check for scheduling conflicts.","status":200,"tokens":[119,292],"elapsed":16.195664208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
