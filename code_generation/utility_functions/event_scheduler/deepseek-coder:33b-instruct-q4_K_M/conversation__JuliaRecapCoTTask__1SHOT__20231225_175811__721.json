[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The function `event_scheduler` will iterate over all pairs of events to check if they overlap:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    isempty(events) && return \"No events\"\n    n = length(events)\n    for i in 1:(n-1), j in (i+1):n\n        starttime1, endtime1 = events[i]\n        starttime2, endtime2 = events[j]\n        \n        if !isnothing(overlaps(starttime1, endtime1, starttime2, endtime2))\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThe `overlaps` function is defined as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction overlaps(start_time1, end_time1, start_time2, end_time2)\n    dt1 = DateTime(start_time1, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    dt2 = DateTime(end_time1, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    dt3 = DateTime(start_time2, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n    dt4 = DateTime(end_time2, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")\n\n    # Check for overlap\n    if (dt1 <= dt3 < dt2) || (dt1 < dt4 <= dt2) || (dt3 <= dt1 && dt4 >= dt2)\n        return true\n    end\n    return nothing\nend\n```\nThe `event_scheduler` function checks all pairs of events for overlap. If it finds any overlapping pair, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\". In the case that there are no events, the function simply returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[451,448],"elapsed":86.216898834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
