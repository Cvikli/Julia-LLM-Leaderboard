Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The function `event_scheduler` takes an array of events where each event is a tuple with start and end times. It parses these times into DateTime objects, then checks for any overlapping events. If there are no overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\". If there are, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nHere's the Julia code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events), j in (i+1):length(events)\n        start1, finish1 = DateTime.(events[i] .|> x->replace(x,\" \", \"T\"), dateformat\"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM\")\n        start2, finish2 = DateTime.(events[j] .|> x->replace(x,\" \", \"T\"), dateformat\"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM\")\n        \n        if !(start1 >= finish2 || start2 >= finish1)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided data like so:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis should return \"No conflicts\" since the second event does not overlap with the first one.","status":200,"tokens":[310,389],"elapsed":71.195385958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
