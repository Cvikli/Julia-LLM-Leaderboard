It then sorts the list of events so that events which start earlier are at the beginning of the sorted list. For each event, it checks if the end time of the current event is later than the start time of the next one - if so, a conflict has been found and the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts were found after checking all pairs of consecutive events, then there are no conflicts in total and the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[163,351],"elapsed":61.550093416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
