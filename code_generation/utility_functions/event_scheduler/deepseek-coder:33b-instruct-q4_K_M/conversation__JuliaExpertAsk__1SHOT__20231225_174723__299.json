If it's not, it converts each event into a tuple of two `DateTime` objects representing the start and finish time of the event. It then sorts this array by the start times. Finally, it iterates over the sorted array checking if any end time is later than the next start time. If it finds such an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[163,360],"elapsed":62.123017,"_type":"aimessage"}]
