If not, it returns \"No events\". Then, it parses each event into a tuple of `DateTime` objects for start and finish times respectively. It sorts these parsed events by their start times. After that, it iterates through the sorted events and checks whether the start time of any event is before the end time of its predecessor. If such an overlap is found, \"Conflict\" is returned. If no overlaps are detected after scanning all the events, \"No conflicts\" is returned. \n\nPlease note that this function considers any overlap as a conflict because if you have multiple events in progress at once (i.e., two or more events not just overlapping but also being started and ending at the same time), it would be inefficient to schedule them all together. If you want to consider these situations separately, you may need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[163,431],"elapsed":73.885828459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
