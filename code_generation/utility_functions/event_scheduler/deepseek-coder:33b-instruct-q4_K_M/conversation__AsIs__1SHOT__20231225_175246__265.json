Then, it formats the event tuples as `DateTime` objects to allow comparison between them. It sorts these events by their start time and then iterates over each pair of consecutive events checking for conflicts. If any two successive events overlap in time, a conflict is found and function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it will return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[119,317],"elapsed":54.442031417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
