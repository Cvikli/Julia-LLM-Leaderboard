First, we sort the list of events by their start time using the `sorted` function. This ensures that we can compare events consistently without worrying about the order in which they were provided.\n2. Next, we create a dictionary of event start times to avoid duplicates. This allows us to quickly look up the start time of an event without having to iterate over the list multiple times.\n3. Then, we iterate over the list of events and check for any scheduling conflicts using a simple loop. For each event, we check if it overlaps with any other events in the list by comparing its start time to the start time of the other event. If there is an overlap, we return \"Conflict\".\n4. Finally, if there are no conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that this function assumes that the events are in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` represents the date and `HH:MM` represents the time. You may need to modify the code slightly if your event data is in a different format.","status":200,"tokens":[1,551],"elapsed":18.517131292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
