Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    for (i, e1) in enumerate(events)\n        for e2 in events[i+1:end]\n            if overlaps(e1, e2)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nfunction overlaps(e1::Tuple{String, String}, e2::Tuple{String, String})\n    s1 = Date(e1[1])\n    f1 = Date(e1[2])\n    s2 = Date(e2[1])\n    f2 = Date(e2[2])\n    return (s1 <= s2 && s2 <= f1) || (s1 <= f2 && f2 <= f1)\nend\n```\nThis code defines a `event_scheduler` function that takes a list of events as input and checks for any overlapping events. The function uses the `overlaps` function to check if two events overlap in time, which returns `true` if there is an overlap and `false` otherwise. If there are no overlapping events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If there are overlapping events, the function returns \"Conflict\".\n\nThe code also defines a `overlaps` function that takes two tuples as input, where each tuple represents an event in the format of (\"start time\", \"end time\"). The function parses the start and end times using the `Date` package, and then checks if there is an overlap between the two events.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the list of events is not empty, so it will throw an error if you pass an empty list as input. If you want to handle empty lists gracefully, you can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[318,420],"elapsed":14.07774063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
