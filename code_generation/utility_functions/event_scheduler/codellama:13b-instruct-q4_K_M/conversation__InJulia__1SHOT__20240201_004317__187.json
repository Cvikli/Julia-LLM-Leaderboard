[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\nThe function first checks whether the list is empty, and returns \"No events\" if it is. Then, it sorts the events by their start times using the `sort` function from the Dates package. This allows us to easily check for overlapping events by comparing the end time of each event with the start time of the next event in the list.\n\nIf there are any conflicts, we return \"Conflict\". If not, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":3.838415212,"_type":"aimessage"}]
