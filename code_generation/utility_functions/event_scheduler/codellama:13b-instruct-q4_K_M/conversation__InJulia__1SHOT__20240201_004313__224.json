It then iterates over each event in the list, comparing it with all other events to check for any overlapping time periods. If any overlapping is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's an example usage of the `event_scheduler` function:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 12:00\", \"2023-01-01 13:00\")]\nprint(event_scheduler(events)) # prints \"No conflicts\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,413],"elapsed":5.646955716,"_type":"aimessage"}]
