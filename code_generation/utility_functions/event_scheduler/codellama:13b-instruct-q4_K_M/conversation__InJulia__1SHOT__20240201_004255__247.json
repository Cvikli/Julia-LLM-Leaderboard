The function first checks if the list is empty, in which case it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it iterates through the events and checks for any overlapping times by comparing the start and finish times of each event pair. If any two events overlap, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can test this function with a list of events like this:\n```julia\nevents = [(DateTime(2023, 1, 1), DateTime(2023, 1, 5)), (DateTime(2023, 1, 6), DateTime(2023, 1, 10))]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: No conflicts\n```","status":200,"tokens":[124,383],"elapsed":5.18859592,"_type":"aimessage"}]
