Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{Date, Date}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted = sort(events; by=first)\n\n    for (i, event1) in enumerate(sorted)\n        for (j, event2) in enumerate(sorted[i+1:end])\n            if event1.second >= event2.first\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function sorts the events based on their start time using `sort` from the `Dates` package, and then iterates through each event to check for any overlapping times. If an overlap is found, it returns `\"Conflict\"`, otherwise it returns `\"No conflicts\"` if there are no overlapping events.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input list of events is sorted by their start time. If the list is not sorted, you can sort it first using `sort(events; by=first)` before passing it to the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,251],"elapsed":3.415003901,"_type":"aimessage"}]
