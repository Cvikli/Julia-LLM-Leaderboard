If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe `overlap` function takes two events as input and checks if they overlap by comparing their start and finish times. It uses the `DateFormat` type from the `Dates` package to parse the dates and times in the format `\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,388],"elapsed":5.393455918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
