[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

For each event, we extract its start and finish time as `e1 = events[i][1]` and `e2 = events[i][2]`.\n- We then iterate over every other event (starting from the next one) using `for j in (i+1):length(events)`. For each event, we extract its start and finish time as `s1 = events[j][1]` and `f1 = events[j][2]`.\n- We check if any of these two events overlap in time by comparing their start times. If the first event starts before the second event ends and the second event starts before the first event ends, then they are conflicting. We use the `&&` operator to check if both conditions are met at once.\n- We return \"Conflict\" immediately if we find any conflicting events, otherwise we continue iterating over all pairs of events until the end. If no conflicts were found, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,423],"elapsed":5.9553406,"_type":"aimessage"}]
