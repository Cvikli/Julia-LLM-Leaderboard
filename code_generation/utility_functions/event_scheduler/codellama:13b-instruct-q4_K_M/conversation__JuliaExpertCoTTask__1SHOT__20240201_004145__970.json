It then converts the start and finish times to `Date` objects using the `Dates` package. Finally, it checks if any two events overlap in time by comparing their start and finish times. If there are no overlapping events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If any events overlap in time, the function returns \"Conflict\". If the input list is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":4.53330108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
