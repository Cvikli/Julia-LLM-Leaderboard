X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n\t* `isless(a, b)` to check if `a` is less than `b`\n\t* `maximum(a, b)` to find the maximum of `a` and `b`\n\t* `minimum(a, b)` to find the minimum of `a` and `b`\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* First, define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events as an argument.\n\t* Iterate through each event in the list and check if it overlaps with any other events using the `isless` function. If there is no overlap, return \"No conflicts\".\n\t* If there is any overlap, iterate through each event again and find the maximum start time and minimum finish time of all the events that overlap. Use the `maximum` and `minimum` functions to find these values.\n\t* Return \"Conflict\" if there is any overlap among the events, otherwise return \"No conflicts\".\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with a variety of inputs to ensure that it works correctly. This includes testing with different numbers of overlapping events and different times for each event.\n\nHere's the final code:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    conflicts = false\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        for j in i+1:length(events)\n            start1, finish1 = events[i]\n            start2, finish2 = events[j]\n            if isless(finish1, start2) || isless(finish2, start1)\n                conflicts = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    if conflicts\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,473],"elapsed":6.680237121,"_type":"aimessage"}]
