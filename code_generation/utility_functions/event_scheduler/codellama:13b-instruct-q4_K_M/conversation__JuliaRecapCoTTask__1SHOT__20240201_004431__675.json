[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It takes a list of events as input and returns \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". The function first sorts the events by start time using the `sort!` function from the Julia standard library. Then, it iterates through the sorted events to check for overlapping events using the `isoverlap` function. Finally, it returns the appropriate message based on whether any conflicts were found or not.\n\nThe `isoverlap` function takes two events as input and checks if they overlap in time by converting the start and end times of each event into `Dates.DateTime` objects using the `parse` function from the Julia standard library. If there is an overlapping event, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nNote that this code uses the `Dates` package for parsing dates and times, which provides a convenient way to work with date-time values in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,516],"elapsed":7.354794542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
