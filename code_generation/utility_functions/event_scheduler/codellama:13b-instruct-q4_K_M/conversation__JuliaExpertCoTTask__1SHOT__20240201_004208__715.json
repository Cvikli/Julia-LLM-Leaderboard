Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

It then iterates over each tuple and uses the `Date` package to parse the string representations of the dates into actual `Date` objects. Finally, it checks if any events overlap in time by comparing their start and finish times. If there are no conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\". If there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". If the input list is empty, the function returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,228],"elapsed":3.15074324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
