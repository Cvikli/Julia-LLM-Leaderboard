Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for the given problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    start_times = map(x -> DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(split(x[1], ' ')[1] * 'T' * split(x[1], ' ')[2]), events)\n    finish_times = map(x -> DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")(split(x[2], ' ')[1] * 'T' * split(x[2], ' ')[2]), events)\n\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        if start_times[i+1] < finish_times[i] || start_times[i] > finish_times[i+1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe function `event_scheduler` receives an array of tuples representing the events. It first checks if there are no events in the input, if so it returns `\"No events\"`. Then it creates arrays containing the start and finish times for each event. It then compares each pair of events to check for any overlapping intervals. If an overlap is found, it returns `\"Conflict\"` otherwise, it returns `\"No conflicts\"`.\nThe dates are formatted with `DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")`, where the 'T' character separates the date and time strings. This separation is necessary because Julia interprets these as separate arguments when passed to a function.","status":200,"tokens":[310,384],"elapsed":13.056826834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
