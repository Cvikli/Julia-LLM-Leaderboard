Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia. It first parses the dates, then sorts them by start time, and checks for overlaps among consecutive events.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates: DateFormat, Date, parse\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    parsed_events = mapreduce(x -> [Date.(x[1], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")), Date.(x[2], DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))], vcat, events)\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events)\n    \n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i] > sorted_events[i-1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThe `event_scheduler` function first checks if the event list is empty. If it's not, it parses each pair of dates (start and finish times) in the events vector into a Date object using Dates package. It then merges all these Date objects into one big Vector. After that, it sorts this merged vector by its elements.\n\nAfter sorting the list of parsed start and end times, the function goes through each element in the sorted list (starting from the second element since we're interested in pairs of consecutive events) and checks whether the current time is greater than the previous one. If it is, that means there's a conflict with the previous event so it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it goes through all these elements without finding any conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[163,387],"elapsed":12.268389417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
