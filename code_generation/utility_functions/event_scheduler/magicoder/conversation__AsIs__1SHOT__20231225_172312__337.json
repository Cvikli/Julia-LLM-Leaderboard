Then it checks for overlapping events by comparing each event's end time with the next event's start time. \n\nThis implementation assumes that the dates and times are in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. If the times aren't sorted properly, you might need to sort them first or adjust the comparison code accordingly.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n\n    events = sorted([datetime.strptime(start_finish[0], \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\") for start_finish in events])\n\n    for i in range(len(events) - 1):\n        if events[i+1] <= events[i]:\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nIn the above function, `event_scheduler` , we first sort a list of datetimes (the start and finish times) using the `sorted` function. Then for each index in the sorted list, we check if the next event's start time is less than or equal to the current event's end time. If it is, that means there's an overlap between the two events, so we return \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\". \n\nIf `events` is empty (i.e., there are no events), then we return \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[121,348],"elapsed":10.801812041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
