The function first checks if the event list is empty. If it's not, then it parses all start times to get DateTime objects and does the same for end times. It then sorts both lists in ascending order of start times and descending order of finish times. Then it compares each pair of events from sorted lists to check for any overlapping events by adding a condition if a start time of an event is later than the end time of the previous one, then it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflict found throughout all pairs of events in both lists, then it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[124,377],"elapsed":11.746015209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
