Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The idea is to sort the events by their start time and then compare each pair of consecutive events. If any pair of consecutive events overlap in time, it means there's a conflict.\n\nHere is how you could write `event_scheduler` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    # If the list of events is empty, return \"No events\"\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse each event's start and finish time into DateTime type\n    parsed_events = map(event -> (DateTime(event[1]), DateTime(event[2])), events)\n\n    # Sort the events by their start time\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, lt=((e1, e2)->e1[1]<e2[1]))\n\n    # Check for overlapping events\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if isempty(findall(sorted_events[i][2] .<= sorted_events[i+1][1]))\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If we made it this far, there are no conflicts\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the event's start and finish times into `DateTime` type. Then it sorts these events by their start time. Afterwards, for each pair of consecutive events, it checks if the end time of the previous event is later than or equal to the start time of the next event - if that's true, there is an overlap.","status":200,"tokens":[310,402],"elapsed":19.663075959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
