[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

We use the Dates package for parsing the time and compare them:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events) \n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i = 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start_i, finish_i = parse.(DateTime, split(events[i], ' '))\n        next_start_j, _ = parse.(DateTime, split(events[(i+1):end][1], ' '))\n        \n        if (start_i < next_start_j && start_i + Minute(20) > next_start_j) || \n            (next_start_j < start_i && next_start_j + Minute(20) > start_i)\n        \n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a message indicating that there are no events. It then loops through each event, compares the start time of the current event with the start time of the next event (plus 20 minutes) and returns \"Conflict\" if they overlap. Otherwise, it continues to the next pair of events until all have been checked. If none of them overlap, it finally returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[124,325],"elapsed":10.095259292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
