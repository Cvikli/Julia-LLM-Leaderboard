Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a brief and concise solution using the latest Julia syntax:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    start_finish_pairs = [(Date(first(e), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), Date(last(e), \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for e in events]\n    sorted_events = sort!(start_finish_pairs, by=x -> x[1])\n    \n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i][2] > sorted_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    isempty(events) ? return \"No events\" : return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first parses the date-time strings into `DateTime` objects using the Dates package and sorts them based on their start times. It then checks for any overlaps by comparing the end time of an event with the start time of the next one. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\" or \"No events\" if the input is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[161,274],"elapsed":6.810437959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
