Then, it sorts the events by their start time using `sort()` from the Base module. After sorting, the function iterates through the events checking if any event starts before the previous event ends. If any such event is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after iterating through all the events, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nYou can parse the date-time strings and create tuples before calling the `event_scheduler` function like this:\n\n```julia\nevents = [\n    (DateTime(\"2023-01-01 10:00\"), DateTime(\"2023-01-01 12:00\")),\n    (DateTime(\"2023-01-01 13:00\"), DateTime(\"2023-01-01 15:00\")),\n    # Add more events as needed\n]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n```\n\nThis will output \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time.","status":200,"tokens":[122,467],"elapsed":12.674343333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
