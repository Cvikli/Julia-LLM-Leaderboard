If there are no conflicts, the total number of keys in the dictionary should be equal to the sum of the values. If there is a conflict, the sum of the values will be greater than the number of keys, indicating that some minutes are assigned to more than one event.","status":200,"tokens":[119,569],"elapsed":26.814523625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
