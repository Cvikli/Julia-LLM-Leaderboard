[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It checks for any conflicts by iterating through the sorted events and comparing the start time of each event with the end time of the previous event. If there are no conflicts, the function returns \"No conflicts\" if there are events or \"No events\" if the list is empty.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nevents = [\n    (\"2022-01-01 10:00\", \"2022-01-01 12:00\"),\n    (\"2022-01-01 13:00\", \"2022-01-01 15:00\"),\n]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: \"No conflicts\"\n\nconflicting_events = [\n    (\"2022-01-01 10:00\", \"2022-01-01 12:00\"),\n    (\"2022-01-01 11:30\", \"2022-01-01 13:00\"),\n]\nprintln(event_scheduler(conflicting_events)) # Output: \"Conflict\"\n\nprintln(event_scheduler([])) # Output: \"No events\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[424,632],"elapsed":14.214773334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
