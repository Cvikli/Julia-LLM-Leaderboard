Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Parse the input tuples into `DateTime` objects using the Dates package.\n   - Sort the events by their start times.\n   - Iterate through the sorted events and check if the current event's start time is less than or equal to the previous event's end time. If so, there is a conflict.\n   - Return \"No conflicts\" if no conflicts are found, \"Conflict\" if any conflicts are found, or \"No events\" if the input list is empty.\n\n2.
