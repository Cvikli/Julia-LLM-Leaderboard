Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    events = [(Date(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), Date(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sorted_events = sort(events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events) - 1\n        if sorted_events[i+1][1] <= sorted_events[i][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list is empty, and if so, it returns \"No events\". If not, it parses the dates and sorts the events. Then, it iterates through the sorted list of events to find any conflicts. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[161,251],"elapsed":5.692650833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
