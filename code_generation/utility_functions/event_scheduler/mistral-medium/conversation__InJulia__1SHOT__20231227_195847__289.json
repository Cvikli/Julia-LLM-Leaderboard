[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Otherwise, it sorts the list of events by their start times. Then, it iterates through the sorted list, checking for any overlapping events. If it finds an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". If it goes through the entire list without finding any overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\". Note that this solution assumes that the input events are given as tuples of strings, and uses the Dates package to parse and compare them.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 12:00\"),\n    (\"2023-01-01 13:00\", \"2023-01-01 15:00\"),\n    (\"2023-01-01 11:30\", \"2023-01-01 13:30\")\n]\n\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result) # prints \"Conflict\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the third event overlaps with the first event, so the function returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[122,452],"elapsed":23.123928584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
