Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Think through your approach step by step:\n   a. Parse the input tuples into `DateTime` objects using the `Dates` package.\n   b. Sort the events by their start times.\n   c. Iterate through the sorted events and check if the current event's start time is less than or equal to the previous event's end time.\n   d. If there is an overlap, return \"Conflict\".\n   e. If no overlaps are found after checking all events, return \"No conflicts\".\n   f. If the input list is empty, return \"No events\".\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Parse the input tuples into DateTime objects\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(end)) for (start, end) in events]\n    \n    # Sort the events by their start times\n    sorted_events = sort(parsed_events, by = first)\n    \n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] <= sorted_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # If no conflicts, return the appropriate message\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3.
