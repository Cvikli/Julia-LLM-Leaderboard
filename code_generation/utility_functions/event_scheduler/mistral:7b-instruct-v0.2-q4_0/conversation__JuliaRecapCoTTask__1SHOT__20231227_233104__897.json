X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Recall Julia snippets:\n   - Use the `Dates` package for parsing dates and times.\n   - Define a function to check if there is any conflict between two events based on their start and finish times.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n   - Write the `event_scheduler` function that takes an array of tuples as input, where each tuple represents an event with its start and finish time.\n   - Parse each event's start and finish time using Dates' `parse` function.\n   - Iterate through the events, check if there is any conflict between the current event and any previously processed events using the helper function.\n   - If a conflict is found, return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, process the next event.\n   - Once all events have been checked, return \"No conflicts\" if there were no conflicts, or \"No events\" if the input was empty.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Test the function with various edge cases and different inputs to ensure it returns the expected results. This can be done using test functions or simply by running the function in different scenarios and observing its behavior.","status":200,"tokens":[427,277],"elapsed":10.794616417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
