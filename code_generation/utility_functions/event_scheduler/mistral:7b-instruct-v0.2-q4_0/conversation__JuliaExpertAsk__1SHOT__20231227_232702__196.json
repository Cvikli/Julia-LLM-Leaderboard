It then checks for scheduling conflicts by iterating through each pair of events, comparing their start and end times. If there is a conflict, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the input vector is empty, no output will be returned as there is no need to explicitly check for that case in this code snippet.","status":200,"tokens":[160,262],"elapsed":8.711174709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
