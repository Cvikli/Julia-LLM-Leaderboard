Think through my approach step by step:\n   - Define a helper function to parse the event times using `Dates` package.\n   - Iterate through each pair of events and check if they overlap in time.\n   - Return \"No conflicts\" if all events are distinct, otherwise return \"Conflict\".\n\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_parse(event::Tuple)\n    start = parse(\"$(event[1]) $(event[2])\")\n    finish = parse(\"$(event[3]) $(event[4])\")\n    return (start, finish)\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::AbstractVector{Tuple})\n    parsed_events = map(x -> event_parse(x), events)\n    distinct_events = filter(x -> length(findfirst(x -> x == parsed_events[i], parsed_events)) == 0 for i in 1:length(parsed_events))\n    \n    if isempty(distinct_events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    elseif length(distinct_events) == length(parsed_events)\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3.
