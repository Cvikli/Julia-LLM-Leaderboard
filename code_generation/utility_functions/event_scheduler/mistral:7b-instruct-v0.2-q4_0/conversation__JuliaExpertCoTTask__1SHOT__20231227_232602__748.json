Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Check that my solution is correct:\n\nThe function correctly identifies the scheduling conflict in this case and returns \"Conflict\". If there were no conflicts, it would have returned \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[307,462],"elapsed":16.163351709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
