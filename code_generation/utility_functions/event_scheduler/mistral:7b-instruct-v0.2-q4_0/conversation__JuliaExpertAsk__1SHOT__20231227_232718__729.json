Then it iterates through the sorted list and checks for any potential conflicts between adjacent events. If a conflict is detected, it stores the string \"Conflict\" in an array and breaks out of the loop. The final return statement checks if there are any conflicts stored in the array. If not, it returns the string \"No conflicts\". If the input vector is empty, the function will return \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[160,290],"elapsed":9.599529125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
