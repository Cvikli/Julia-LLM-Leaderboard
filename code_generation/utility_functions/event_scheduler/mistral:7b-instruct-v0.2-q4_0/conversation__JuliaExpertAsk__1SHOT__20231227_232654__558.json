It then iterates through each event, checking if any other event overlaps with it (start-to-end or end-to-start). If there is a conflict, the function stores the conflicting event in a `conflicts` vector. Finally, depending on the length of the input list and the vector of conflicts, the function returns either \"No events\", \"No conflicts\" or \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[160,251],"elapsed":8.376931708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
