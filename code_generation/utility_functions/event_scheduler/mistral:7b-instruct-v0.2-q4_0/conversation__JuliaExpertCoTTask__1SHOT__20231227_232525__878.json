We import the `Dates` package to parse and manipulate dates and times.\n2. Define the function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events as its argument.\n3. Check if there are no events and return \"No events\" if true.\n4. Sort the events based on their start times using the built-in `sort` function and a custom comparison function.\n5. Initialize some variables for keeping track of the current end time and the final result.\n6. Iterate through each event in the sorted list, updating the current end time and checking if there's any overlap with the next event. If there is an overlap, set the result to \"Conflict\" and break out of the loop.\n7. Return the final result after processing all events.","status":200,"tokens":[307,373],"elapsed":13.753777291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
