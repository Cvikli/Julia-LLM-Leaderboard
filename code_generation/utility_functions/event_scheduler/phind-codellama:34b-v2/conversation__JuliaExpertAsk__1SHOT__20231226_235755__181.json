Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement the `event_scheduler` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    timestamps = sort([DateTime(split(event[1], ' ')[1]*'T'*split(event[1], ' ')[2]) for event in events] .+ \n                      [Dates.Minute(parse(Int, split(event[2], ':')[2])) for event in events])\n    push!(timestamps, timestamps[end]+Dates.Minute(1))\n    \n    for i = 1:length(timestamps)-1\n        if timestamps[i+1] - Dates.Minute(parse(Int, split(events[i][2], ':')[2])) < timestamps[i]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the event list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. Otherwise, it creates a vector of sorted DateTime objects representing each event's start time and duration. It then iterates through this vector, checking if any event ends after the next one starts (indicating a scheduling conflict). If so, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: This function assumes that all input events have valid 'start' and 'finish' times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. It also assumes that the finish time is always later than the start time.","status":200,"tokens":[174,381],"elapsed":51.56628025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
