If it's not, it iterates over each event and converts its start and finish times into DateTime format. It then compares these times with those of all other events. If any pair of events has overlapping time intervals, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found after checking all events, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[135,436],"elapsed":57.193235792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
