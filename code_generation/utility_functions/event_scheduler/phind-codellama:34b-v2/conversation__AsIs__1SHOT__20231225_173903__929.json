If it is, it returns \"No events\". \n\nThen, it sorts the events by start time. This is necessary as we want to check for conflicts assuming that the events are happening in a chronological order.\n\nAfterwards, we iterate over the sorted event list and check if the next event starts before the current one ends. If this is true, it means there's an overlap, hence a conflict.\n\nIf no conflicts are found after checking all possible pairs of events, the function returns \"No conflicts\". \n\nPlease note that the format \"y-m-d H:M\" used in DateTime function matches with your provided format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.","status":200,"tokens":[132,344],"elapsed":45.553765833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
