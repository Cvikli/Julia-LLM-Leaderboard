Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `Date` and `Time` from Dates to parse the date and time. Then, you should sort the events based on their starting times. After that, if any event finishes before the next event starts, there is no conflict. If not, then it results in a conflict.\n\nHere's an example of how the function could be implemented:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_event(event)\n    start = DateTime(replace(event[1], \" \" => \"T\"), dateformat\"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM\")\n    finish = DateTime(replace(event[2], \" \" => \"T\"), dateformat\"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM\")\n    return (start, finish)\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    parsed_events = parse_event.(events)\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=x->x[1])  # Sort by start time\n\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)-1\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2022-03-05 10:00\", \"2022-03-05 12:00\"), (\"2022-03-05 13:00\", \"2022-03-05 14:00\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[174,392],"elapsed":52.566513666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
