Next, I would check for any conflicts by comparing each event's end time with the next event's start time. If any end time is later than the next start time, then a conflict is present. Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction parse_time(t::AbstractString)\n    return DateTime(t, dateformat\"Y-m-d H:M\")\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    parsed_events = [(parse_time(s), parse_time(e)) for (s, e) in events]\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=first)\n\n    for i in 1:length(parsed_events)-1\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Prints \"No conflicts\"\n\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Prints \"Conflict\"\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions, `parse_time` to parse the given time string into a `DateTime` object, and `event_scheduler` to perform the scheduling conflict check. The example events are checked using the `event_scheduler` function, which prints the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[309,508],"elapsed":16.017968584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
