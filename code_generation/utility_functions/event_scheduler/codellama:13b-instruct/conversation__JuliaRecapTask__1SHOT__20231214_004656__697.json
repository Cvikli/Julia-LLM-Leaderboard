X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

I will follow your systematic approach to solving problems and use the Julia language syntax and libraries you mentioned. Let's get started!\n\nTo begin with, I will recall some useful Julia snippets that can help me solve the task:\n\n1. Parsing dates using Dates package: `Dates.Date(string)`\n2. Creating a tuple of event start and finish times: `t = (start_time, finish_time)`\n3. Using the `iseq()` function to check for overlapping events: `if iseq(t1, t2) return \"Conflict\"; return \"No conflicts\"`\n4. Slicing arrays using `[ ]`: `events[1:2]`\n5. Creating a dictionary of event start and finish times: `dict = Dict(\"event1\" => (start_time1, finish_time1), \"event2\" => (start_time2, finish_time2)}`\n6. Using the `$` symbol for string interpolation: `message = \"Event ${name} overlaps with event ${other_event}.\"`\n\nNow, let's move on to solving the task! Please provide me with the list of events in a tuple format as described in the problem statement. I will check for any scheduling conflicts among the events and return the result accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[424,305],"elapsed":15.008850125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
