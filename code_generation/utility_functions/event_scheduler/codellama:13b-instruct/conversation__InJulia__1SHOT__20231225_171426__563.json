If it is, we return \"No events\".\n* Otherwise, we loop through all pairs of events using nested loops. For each pair of events, we use the `overlaps` function to check if they overlap in time. If any pair of events overlaps, we return \"Conflict\".\n* If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nThe `overlaps` function takes two event tuples as input and checks if they overlap in time. It does this by checking if the start time of the first event is before the end time of the second event, and if the end time of the first event is after the start time of the second event. If both conditions are true, then the events overlap.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the events are given in chronological order, meaning that the start times of all events come before the end times of any other event. If this is not the case, you may need to sort the list of events first before running the `event_scheduler` function.","status":200,"tokens":[132,497],"elapsed":27.791268708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
