Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return 'No conflicts' if there are no overlapping events and 'Conflict' if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return 'No events'. Use package Dates for parsing.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Check for any overlapping events in the list.\n\nStep 2: If there are no overlapping events, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nStep 3: If there is at least one overlapping event, return \"Conflict\".\n\nNow, let's implement the `event_scheduler` function using the Julia language. Here's an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check for any overlapping events\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    elseif length(events) == 1 || all(x -> !overlap(x[2], x[3]), events)\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    end\nend\n```\nHere's how we can use this function to solve the given example:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThe function will return \"Conflict\" because there is an overlapping event between 11:30 and 12:30.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[271,349],"elapsed":14.188228083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
