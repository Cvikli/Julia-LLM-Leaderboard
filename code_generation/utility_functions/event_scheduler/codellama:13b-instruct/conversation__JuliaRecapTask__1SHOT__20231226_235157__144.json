[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The function takes a vector of tuples, where each tuple represents an event with its start and finish time as `Date` objects.\n\nThe function first checks if there are any events in the input list by using the `isempty` function. If there are no events, it returns \"No events\".\n\nNext, the function loops through each event and checks for conflicts with all other events. It uses the `parse` function to convert the date and time strings into `DateTime` objects. Then, it compares the start and finish times of each event with the corresponding values of all other events. If any two events overlap in time, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\" at the end of the loop.","status":200,"tokens":[432,472],"elapsed":30.068203291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
