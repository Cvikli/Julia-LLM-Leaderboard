[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

The `Event` struct is defined with two fields, `start` and `finish`, both of which are of type `DateTime`.\n2. The `event_scheduler` function takes a list of events as input, and iterates over all pairs of events using the `enumerate()` function.\n3. For each pair of events, we check if there is any overlap in their time ranges by comparing their start and finish times. If there is an overlap, we set the `has_conflict` flag to `true`.\n4. Once we have iterated over all pairs of events, we return the appropriate message based on the value of the `has_conflict` flag. If there are no conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\", otherwise we return \"Conflict\".\n5. Finally, we handle the case where the list of events is empty by returning \"No events\" in that case.\n\nNote that this solution uses the `Dates` package for date and time manipulation, and the `Printf` module for string formatting.","status":200,"tokens":[432,444],"elapsed":28.311641,"_type":"aimessage"}]
