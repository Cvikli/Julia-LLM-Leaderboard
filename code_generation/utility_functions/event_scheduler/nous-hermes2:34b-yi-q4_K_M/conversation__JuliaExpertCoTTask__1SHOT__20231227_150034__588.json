Define a function `event_scheduler` that takes the list of events as input\n2. Initialize an empty set called `overlapping_events`\n3. Loop through each event in the given list\n4. For each event, parse its start and finish time using `Date()` and store them in variables `start` and `finish` respectively\n5. Use `in` operator to check if any other events have overlapping times with this event by comparing their `start` and `finish` values\n6. If an overlap is found, add the current event to `overlapping_events`\n7. After checking all events, return \"No conflicts\" if `overlapping_events` set is empty, or \"Conflict\" otherwise\n8.
