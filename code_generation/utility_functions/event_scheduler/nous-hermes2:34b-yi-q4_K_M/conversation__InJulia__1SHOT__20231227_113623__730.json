Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        event = events[i]\n        next_event = events[i+1]\n        start = Date(string(event[1]))\n        finish = Date(string(event[2]))\n        next_start = Date(string(next_event[1]))\n        next_finish = Date(string(next_event[2]))\n\n        if start <= next_start && finish >= next_start || start <= next_finish && finish >= next_finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of events as input and iterates through each event, comparing its start and end time with the start and end times of the next event. If there is any overlap between the two events, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it continues to the next pair of events until all pairs have been checked or no conflicts are found, in which case it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that each tuple in `events` contains exactly two elements representing the start and finish time of an event in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.","status":200,"tokens":[123,345],"elapsed":59.467304708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
