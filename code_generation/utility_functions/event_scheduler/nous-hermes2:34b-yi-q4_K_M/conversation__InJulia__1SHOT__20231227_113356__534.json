We will also need to parse each event's start and finish times from strings into actual date-time values using the `format!` function.\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse start and finish times for each event\n    parsed_times = []\n    for (start, finish) in events\n        dt = DateTime()\n        format!(dt, Dates.format(dt, dateformat\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"))\n        push!(parsed_times, (parse(Date, start), parse(Time, finish)))\n    end\n    \n    # Check for conflicts among the events\n    conflicts = false\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start1, finish1 = parsed_times[i]\n        finish2 = parsed_times[i+1][2]\n        if isafter(finish1, start2)\n            conflicts = true\n            break\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return conflicts ? \"Conflict\" : \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you can create a list of events like so:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2021-09-01 08:30\", \"2021-09-01 10:00\"), (\"2021-09-01 16:00\", \"2021-09-01 17:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs: Conflict\n```","status":200,"tokens":[123,438],"elapsed":75.03689525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
