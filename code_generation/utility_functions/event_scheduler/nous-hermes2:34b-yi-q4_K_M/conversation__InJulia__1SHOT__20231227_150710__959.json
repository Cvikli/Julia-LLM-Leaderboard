First, you need to add the `Dates` package to your project by running the following command:\n```julia\n]add Dates\n```\nNext, here is a function that solves the given problem:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Create an empty set to store overlapping events\n    overlapping = Set{Int}()\n\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        start_time1, finish_time1 = Dates.value.(DateTime.(events[i]))\n        finish_time1 += Hour(1) # Add a buffer to avoid exact overlaps\n\n        # Check if the next event starts within the current event's duration\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_time2, finish_time2 = Dates.value.(DateTime.(events[j]))\n\n            if start_time2 <= finish_time1 && start_time2 >= start_time1\n                push!(overlapping, i) # Record the overlapping event index\n                break\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Check if there are any conflicts\n    if isempty(overlapping)\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    else\n        conflicting_events = map(events[x] for x in overlapping)\n        return \"Conflict: $(join([string(x) for x in conflicting_events]))\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes a list of events as input, where each event is a tuple containing a start and finish time. It first checks if the list is empty, returning \"No events\" if it is. Then, it iterates through all pairs of consecutive events to check for scheduling conflicts. If there are any overlapping events, it returns a string indicating which events conflict with one another.","status":200,"tokens":[123,446],"elapsed":76.665032875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
