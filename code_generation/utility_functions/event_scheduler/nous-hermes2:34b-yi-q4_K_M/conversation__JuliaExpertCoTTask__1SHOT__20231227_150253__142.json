Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of event tuples as input.\n2. Check if the list is empty, and return \"No events\" in this case.\n3. Initialize an empty list to store start times and finish times for comparison.\n4. Loop through each event tuple in the input list:\n    a. Parse the start time from the tuple into a DateTime object using `DateTime(start_time)`.\n    b. Add the parsed start time to the list of start times.\n    c. Parse the finish time from the tuple into a DateTime object using `DateTime(finish_time)`.\n    d. Add the parsed finish time to the list of finish times.\n5. Sort both lists of start and finish times in ascending order.\n6. Loop through each pair of sorted start and finish times:\n    a. If there is a start time before a finish time, check if any event has its finish time after that start time.\n        i. If no such event exists, there are no conflicts and return \"No conflicts\".\n        ii. Otherwise, find the first conflicting event by iterating through the list of events. The first event with a finish time after the current start time is the conflict.\n    b. If there is a finish time before a start time, check if any event has its start time before that finish time.\n        i. If no such event exists, there are no conflicts and return \"No conflicts\".\n        ii. Otherwise, find the first conflicting event by iterating through the list of events. The first event with a start time before the current finish time is the conflict.\n    c. If both conditions above fail to find any conflicts, continue looping until all pairs are checked.\n7.
