X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Define a function `event_scheduler` that takes in a list of event tuples.\n2. Check if the input event list is empty. If it is, return \"No events\".\n3. Convert the start and finish times of each event tuple to `DateTime` objects using the `Dates.DateTime` constructor.\n4. Sort the list of events based on the start time. This will help in identifying conflicts efficiently.\n5. Iterate through the sorted list of events and check if there are any overlaps, i.e., if the finish time of one event is greater than or equal to the start time of the next event.\n6.
