Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If so, there's a conflict.\n   - Return \"No conflicts\" if no overlaps are found, \"Conflict\" if any are found, and \"No events\" if the list is empty.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse dates and sort events by start time\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=x->x[1])\n    \n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 2:length(parsed_events)\n        if parsed_events[i][1] < parsed_events[i-1][2]  # If current event's start is before previous event's end\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**:\n\nHere, I will apply the `event_scheduler` function to the provided data.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**:\n\nTo ensure correctness, the solution will be tested with a few different sets of data:\n\n- The provided data set.\n- A data set with overlapping events.\n- An empty data set.\n- A data set with exactly adjacent events but no overlaps.\n\nLet's start with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n```\n\nThis should print \"No conflicts\" if the code is correct.
