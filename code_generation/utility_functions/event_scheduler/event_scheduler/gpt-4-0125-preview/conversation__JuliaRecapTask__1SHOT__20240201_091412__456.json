X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

It first parses the string representations of the start and finish times into `DateTime` objects, sorts the events by their start time, and then iterates through the list to check for overlaps between events. If it finds any overlaps, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If it completes the check without finding overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\". If the list of events is empty, it returns \"No events\".\n\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**\n\n- The function correctly handles the conversion of string dates to `DateTime` objects.\n- It sorts the events based on their start time to ensure that we only have to compare consecutive events for overlaps.\n- It correctly iterates through the sorted events, comparing the finish time of the previous event with the start time of the current one to check for overlaps.\n- It returns the appropriate message based on whether it finds conflicts, no events are provided, or all events are scheduled without conflict.","status":200,"tokens":[368,524],"elapsed":45.471111167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
