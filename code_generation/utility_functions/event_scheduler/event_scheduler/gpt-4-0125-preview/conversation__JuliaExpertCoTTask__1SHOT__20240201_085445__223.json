Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Check if the input list is empty. If it is, return \"No events\".\n2. Parse each event's start and finish time using `DateTime` from the `Dates` package in Julia, and sort the events based on their start time.\n3. Iterate through the sorted events, checking if the current event's start time is before the previous event's finish time. If this is the case, there is a conflict, and we return \"Conflict\".\n4. If we go through all events without finding any conflicts, return \"No conflicts\". \n\nLet's implement these steps in Julia code.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Step 1\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Parsing events\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n    \n    # Sorting events based on start time\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=x -> x[1])\n    \n    # Checking for conflicts\n    for i in 2:length(parsed_events)\n        if parsed_events[i][1] < parsed_events[i-1][2]   # If current start is before previous end\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test example\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nMake sure this code is run in a Julia environment where the `Dates` package is available.","status":200,"tokens":[255,362],"elapsed":45.662912625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
