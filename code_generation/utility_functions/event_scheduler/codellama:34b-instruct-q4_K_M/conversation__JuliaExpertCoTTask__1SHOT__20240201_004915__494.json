Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Here is my solution:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Check if there are any events\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Sort the events by start time\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=first)\n    \n    # Iterate over the sorted events and check for conflicts\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i][1] <= sorted_events[i-1][2]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n# Explanation:\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function takes a list of events as input. It first checks if there are any events in the list. If there aren't, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it sorts the events by start time using the `sort!` function from the Dates package.\n\nAfter sorting, the function iterates over the sorted events and checks for conflicts between each pair of consecutive events. It uses the `<=` operator to check if the start time of an event is less than or equal to the end time of the previous event. If there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues checking the remaining events until the end of the list.\n\nIf no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":9.820158438,"_type":"aimessage"}]
