If we find an overlapping event, we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, we continue iterating until we reach the end of the list.\n* If we reach the end of the list without finding any overlapping events, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's an example usage of the `event_scheduler` function:\n```\njulia> event_scheduler([(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 10:30\", \"2023-01-01 11:30\")])\n\"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,410],"elapsed":11.39945048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
