The outer loop iterates over all events, and the inner loop iterates over the remaining events that come after the current event.\n* For each pair of events, we check if they overlap by comparing their start and finish times. If one event's start time is before or equal to another event's finish time, and the other event's start time is before or equal to the first event's finish time, then we have a conflict.\n* If no conflicts are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nHere's an example of how you could use the `event_scheduler` function:\n```\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 10:30\", \"2023-01-01 11:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: Conflict\n```\nIn this example, we have two events that overlap in time, so the function returns \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,445],"elapsed":12.383568916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
