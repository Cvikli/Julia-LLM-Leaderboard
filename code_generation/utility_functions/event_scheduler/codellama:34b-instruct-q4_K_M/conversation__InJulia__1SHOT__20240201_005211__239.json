It first checks if there are any overlapping events by comparing the start and finish times of each event. If any overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 10:30\", \"2023-01-01 11:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: Conflict\n\nevents = [(\"2023-01-01 10:00\", \"2023-01-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-01-01 11:00\", \"2023-01-01 12:00\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events)) # Output: No conflicts\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,391],"elapsed":10.892664668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
