[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Otherwise, it loops through each event in the list and checks if there are any other events that overlap with it. If an overlap is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the input events are already sorted by start time. If this is not the case, you may need to sort the events before running the scheduler.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":6.790822663,"_type":"aimessage"}]
