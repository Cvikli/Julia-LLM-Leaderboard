The function first creates a dictionary to store the start and finish times of each event. It then iterates over the events and adds them to the dictionary.\n\nNext, the function checks for any scheduling conflicts by comparing the start and finish times of each event. If there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". If there are no conflicts, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIn the example provided in the problem statement, the `event_scheduler` function would return \"Conflict\" because the second event (which starts at 2023-12-01 11:30) overlaps with the first event (which finishes at 2023-12-01 11:00).","status":200,"tokens":[0,463],"elapsed":13.23447701,"_type":"aimessage"}]
