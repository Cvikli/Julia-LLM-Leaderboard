The function `event_scheduler` takes a vector of tuples as input, where each tuple represents an event with a start and finish time.\n2. The first step is to check if the list of events is empty. If it is, we return \"No events\".\n3. Next, we sort the list of events by their start times using the `sort!` function from the Dates package. This ensures that the events are in chronological order.\n4. We then iterate over the list of events and check for conflicts. We do this by comparing each event's finish time with the next event's start time. If any conflict is found, we return \"Conflict\".\n5. If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\" at the end of the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,368],"elapsed":10.322482779,"_type":"aimessage"}]
