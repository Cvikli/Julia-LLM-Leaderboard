Recall relevant Julia snippets:\n\t* Importing packages: `using Dates`\n\t* Parsing dates: `DateTime(\"2023-03-14T15:30\", \"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM\")`\n\t* Creating a function with input parameters: `function event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple})`\n\t* Returning a string value based on conditions: `return isempty(conflicts) ? \"No conflicts\" : \"Conflict\"`\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Create a function that takes a vector of tuples, where each tuple represents an event with its start and finish times.\n\t* Use a for loop to iterate over the events and check if any conflicts exist by comparing the start and finish times of each event. If a conflict is found, add it to a list of conflicts called `conflicts`.\n\t* Return \"No conflicts\" if the `conflicts` list is empty, or \"Conflict\" if there are any elements in the list.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with sample input data to ensure it returns the expected output.\n\t* Check for edge cases such as overlapping events or events that start and end at the same time.\n\n## Julia Language Programmer's Reminder on Julia Language\n\n* Key Syntax:\n\t+ Variables: `x = 10`\n\t+ Control structures: `if-elseif-else`, `isX ?
