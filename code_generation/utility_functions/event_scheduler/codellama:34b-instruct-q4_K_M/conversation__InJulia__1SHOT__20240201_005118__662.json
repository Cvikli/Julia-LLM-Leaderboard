It then sorts the events by start time using the `sort!` function from the `Dates` package. Finally, it iterates over the sorted events and checks for any conflicts by comparing the start time of each event with the end time of the previous event. If a conflict is found, the function returns \"Conflict\", otherwise it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":6.705412161,"_type":"aimessage"}]
