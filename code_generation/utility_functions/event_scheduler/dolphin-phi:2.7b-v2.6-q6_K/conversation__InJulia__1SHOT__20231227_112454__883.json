[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

The function will then sort the events by start time and check for any overlap between consecutive events. If it finds an overlap, it will return a string describing the conflict. If there are no overlaps, it will return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2022-01-03 10:00\", \"2022-01-04 09:30\"), (\"2022-01-05 09:00\", \"2022-01-06 08:45\")]\nprint(event_scheduler(events)) # Outputs: Conflict at event 2022-01-03 10:00 - 2022-01-04 09:30 with event 2022-01-05 09:00 - 2022-01-06 08:45\n```","status":200,"tokens":[121,380],"elapsed":10.057506583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
