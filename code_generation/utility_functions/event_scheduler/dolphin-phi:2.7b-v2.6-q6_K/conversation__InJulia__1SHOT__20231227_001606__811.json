If it is, the function returns \"No events\". \n\nIf not, it then converts each event's start and finish times to `DateTime` objects using `Dates.to_datetime`. It does this by mapping over the elements of the `events` array with `collect(map)`, so that we get a sequence of tuples (start time, finish time), which it then unpacks into separate variables `start_times` and `finish_times`.\n\nIt then loops through all pairs of start times. If there is a pair of start times such that one event's finish time is greater than or equal to the other event's start time (i.e., they overlap), the function returns \"Conflict\". \n\nIf no such pair of events was found, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[121,395],"elapsed":10.463651584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
