Then, we use Set to find if there are any overlaps between these ranges. If there is at least one overlap, then it's a scheduling conflict.\n\nHere is the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String}})::AbstractString {\nif size(events) == 0 {\nreturn \"No events\"\n}\nranges = map(fun(e) -> (parse.(Int64, e[2])-parse.(Int64, e[1]), parse.(Int64, e[3])) end, events)\noverlaps = intersect(collect(ranges), collect(ranges))\nif length(overlaps) == 0 {\nreturn \"No conflicts\"\n}\nelse {\nreturn \"Conflict\"\n}\n}\n```\nThis function firstly checks if the `events` is empty. If it's not, then it maps each event to a range of time by subtracting the start time from the finish time. Then, it finds the intersection between all ranges which indicates overlapping events. If there are no overlaps, it returns \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it returns \"Conflict\".\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nevents = [(parse.(Int64, '2020-01-01 10:00'), parse.(Int64, '2020-01-02 09:30')), \n(parse.(Int64, '2020-01-03 08:00'), parse.(Int64, '2020-01-04 11:45'))]\nprint(event_scheduler(events)) // Outputs: \"Conflict\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[121,407],"elapsed":10.778500916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
