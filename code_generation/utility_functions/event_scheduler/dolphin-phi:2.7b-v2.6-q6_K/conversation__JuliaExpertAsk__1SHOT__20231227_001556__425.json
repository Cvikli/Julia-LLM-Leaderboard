It then sorts the events by start time to simplify the comparison process. Next, it iterates through the sorted events and checks for any overlap with the following event.

If no conflicts are found after checking all events, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[158,258],"elapsed":7.003908417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
