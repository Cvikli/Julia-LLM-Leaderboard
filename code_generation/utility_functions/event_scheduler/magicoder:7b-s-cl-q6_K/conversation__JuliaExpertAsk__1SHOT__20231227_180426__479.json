Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that solves the problem. It uses the Dates package for date parsing and comparison:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)  # check if list is empty\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    for i in 1:(length(events)-1)\n        start_i = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") |> parse(String, events[i][1])\n        finish_i = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") |> parse(String, events[i][2])\n        \n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_j = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") |> parse(String, events[j][1])\n            finish_j = DateFormat(\"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\") |> parse(String, events[j][2])\n            \n            if (start_i <= start_j < finish_i) || (start_j <= start_i < finish_j)  # check for overlapping time\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"  # no conflict found, so return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function goes through every pair of events and checks whether they overlap in time. If any pair overlaps, it immediately returns \"Conflict\". If none of the pairs overlap, after going through all possible event pairs, it returns \"No conflicts\". It handles the case where the list is empty by returning \"No events\" when the input is an empty list.","status":200,"tokens":[163,377],"elapsed":20.013101417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
