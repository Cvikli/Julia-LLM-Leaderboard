[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

If it's not empty, we sort the events by their start times. Then for every pair of successive events (i.e., comparing each event with its next one), if the current event starts before or at the same time as its previous event ends, then there is a conflict.\n\nNote: You may want to add error handling code in case an invalid date/time format is passed to parsedatetime(). Also, make sure that your input times are in UTC for consistency across different days and timezones.","status":200,"tokens":[124,329],"elapsed":17.236280375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
