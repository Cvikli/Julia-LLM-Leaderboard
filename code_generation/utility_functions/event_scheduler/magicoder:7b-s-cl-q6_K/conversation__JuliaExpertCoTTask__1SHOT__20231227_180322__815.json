If any event starts before the other's end and ends after the other's start, there is a conflict. \n\nRemember that this solution assumes that the time intervals are non-overlapping. If the given data does not meet this assumption, you will need to modify this function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[310,437],"elapsed":24.133388833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
