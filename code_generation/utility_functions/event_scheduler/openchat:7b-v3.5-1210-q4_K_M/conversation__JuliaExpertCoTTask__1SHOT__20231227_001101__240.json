First, I will import the Dates package as it helps in manipulating dates and times in Julia.\n2. Then, I will create a function `event_scheduler` that accepts an array of tuples (start time, end time) representing events.\n3. If the array is empty, the function will return \"No events\".\n4. Otherwise, the function will iterate over each event and compare its start time with the end times of all other events. \n5. If any start time is found to be equal or less than another event's end time (overlapping), the function will return \"Conflict\".\n6. If no such case is found, the function will return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's how I would implement it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        start_time = Dates.parse(events[i][1])\n        end_time = Dates.parse(events[i][2])\n        conflict = false\n        \n        for j in 1:length(events)\n            if i != j\n                other_start_time = Dates.parse(events[j][1])\n                other_end_time = Dates.parse(events[j][2])\n                \n                if start_time <= other_end_time || end_time >= other_start_time\n                    conflict = true\n                    break\n                end\n            end\n        end\n        \n        if conflict\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nYou can test this function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis should return \"Conflict\" because the second event overlaps with the first one.","status":200,"tokens":[316,540],"elapsed":29.218991375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
