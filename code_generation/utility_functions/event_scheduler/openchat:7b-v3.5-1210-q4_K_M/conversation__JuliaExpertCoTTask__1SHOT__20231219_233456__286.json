If it is, we return \"No events\".\n* In step 2, we create a dictionary of event start times using the `Dict` function from the `Dates` package. We iterate over the events and add the start time of each event to the dictionary.\n* In step 3, we check for scheduling conflicts using a similar dictionary. We iterate over the events again and check if there is an event that starts at the same time as another event. If there is, we add the conflicting event to the `conflicting_events` dictionary.\n* In step 4, we return the result of the function. If there are no conflicts, we return \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, we return \"Conflict\".\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[1,423],"elapsed":14.819902833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
