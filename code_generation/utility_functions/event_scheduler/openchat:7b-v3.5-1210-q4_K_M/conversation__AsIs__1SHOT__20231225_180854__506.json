[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Then we can create a function `event_scheduler` that takes in a list of events and checks for any scheduling conflicts among them. Here's one possible implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n\n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: (x[0]))  # Sort by start time\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_events) - 1):\n        start1, finish1 = sorted_events[i]\n        start2, finish2 = sorted_events[i + 1]\n        \n        if start1 <= finish2 and start2 <= finish1:\n            return \"Conflict\"\n            \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. Then, it sorts the events by their start time using the `sorted()` method with a custom key function. Finally, it iterates through the sorted events, checking for any overlaps. If there are any overlapping events, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[125,287],"elapsed":11.760447458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
