Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:\n\n1. Define an empty set `conflicts` to store the overlapping events.\n2. Iterate over each event in the list using a for loop.\n3. For each event, get the current time using the `Dates.date()` function.\n4. Check if the event overlaps with any other event by using the `intersects` function to check if the event's start and finish times intersect with any other event's start or finish times. If there is an overlap, add the conflict to the `conflicts` set.\n5. After iterating over all events, return a string indicating whether there are any conflicts. If there are no overlapping events, return \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, return \"Conflict\".\n\nI hope this helps!
