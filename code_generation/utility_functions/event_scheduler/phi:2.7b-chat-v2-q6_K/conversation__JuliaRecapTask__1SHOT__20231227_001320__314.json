[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If so, it returns \"No events\". Then, it sorts the list of events based on their start times using a lambda function and the `Dates.parse_date()` method from the Dates package to convert strings to dates for comparison. After sorting, it iterates over the sorted events and checks if the finish time of the current event is earlier than the start time of the next event. If it finds such an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".\nIn the example usage provided, `event_scheduler` is called with a list of three tuples representing events. The function correctly identifies that there is a conflict between the second and third events, as their start times are adjacent but one ends before the other starts. Therefore, the output of the function is \"Conflict\".","status":200,"tokens":[401,432],"elapsed":13.165014875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
