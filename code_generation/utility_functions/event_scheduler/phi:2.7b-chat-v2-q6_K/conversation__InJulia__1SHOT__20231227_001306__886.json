The website has information about several events, each with start and finish times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. \n\nYour task is to organize these events in such a way that no two events overlap in time and find the earliest start time of all the non-overlapping events. The list of events you have scraped looks like this:\n\nevents = [('2022-01-05 12:00', '2022-01-06 14:30'), ('2022-01-03 11:00', '2022-01-04 15:00'), \n ('2022-01-02 10:00', '2022-01-03 13:00'), ('2022-01-10 12:00', '2022-01-12 14:30')]\n\nQuestion: What is the earliest start time of all non-overlapping events?\n\n\nFirst, identify overlapping and non-overlapping events. Overlapping events are those that have a common duration or start/finish times with another event in the list. \n\nNext, create an algorithm to sort these events by their finish times so you can easily find non-overlapping events. \n\nThen use inductive logic and the property of transitivity to find pairs of events that overlap in time and mark them for removal from the list. This involves comparing each event with all others in the list, and if an event overlaps with another, remove both.\n\nOnce you've removed overlapping events, check if any other remaining events still have overlaps. If they do, repeat step 3 until no more overlaps are left. \n\nNow that there are only non-overlapping events, use the 'event_scheduler' function defined in the Julia script to find out if there are any conflicts. This will return \"No conflicts\" if all times are free and \"Conflict\" if there's an overlap.\n\nFinally, check for overlapping events again just to be sure. If you still see overlaps, go back to step 3 and repeat until there are no more overlaps left in the list of remaining non-overlapping events. \n\nAnswer: The earliest start time of all non-overlapping events is ....","status":200,"tokens":[115,821],"elapsed":22.347767166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
