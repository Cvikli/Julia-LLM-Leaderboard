Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n\t* The `Dates` package is used for date and time manipulation in Julia. It provides a convenient way to parse dates and times from strings.\n2. Define the function `event_scheduler` with two parameters, `events` and `special_instructions`.\n3. Check if the list of events is empty. If it is, return \"No events\" and end the function.\n4. Iterate over each event in the list using a `for` loop.\n5. For each event, use the `Dates.parse` function to parse the start and finish times from the string format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n6. Use the `isoverlap` function provided by the `Dates` package to check if there is an overlap between the current event and any other event in the list. If there is an overlap, return \"Conflict\" and end the function.\n7. If there are no overlaps, continue to the next event in the list.\n8. Once all events have been checked for overlaps, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere is the complete code:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1}, special_instructions::String)\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    for (start, finish) in events\n        start_time = Dates.parse(start, \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n        finish_time = Dates.parse(finish, \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\")\n        \n        if any(isoverlap((start_time, finish_time), (s, f)) for (s, f) in events)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,450],"elapsed":3.877593218,"_type":"aimessage"}]
