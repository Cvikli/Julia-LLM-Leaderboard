Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    start_times = map(e -> DateTime(e[1], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\"), events)\n    finish_times = map(e -> DateTime(e[2], \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\"), events)\n    for i in 1:length(start_times)-1\n        if start_times[i] >= finish_times[i+1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty. If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it maps each start and finish time in the event tuple to a `DateTime` object using the `Dates.DateTime` constructor with the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\".\n\nNext, it iterates through the list of start times and checks if any two events overlap in time by comparing their finish times. If an overlap is found, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration until all events have been checked and no overlap was found. If the entire loop completes without finding any overlaps, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":2.537175493,"_type":"aimessage"}]
