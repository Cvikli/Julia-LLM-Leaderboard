[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

If it is, it returns \"No events\". Otherwise, it creates a sorted dictionary of start times and their corresponding finish times using the `sort!` and `map` functions from the `Dates` package. It then iterates through the sorted list of start times using a for loop, checking if each start time overlaps with the next start time using the `>=` operator. If any overlap is detected, the function returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues until all events have been checked and returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,278],"elapsed":2.396843548,"_type":"aimessage"}]
