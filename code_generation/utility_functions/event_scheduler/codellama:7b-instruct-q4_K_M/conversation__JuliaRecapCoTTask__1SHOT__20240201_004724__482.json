[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

If it is, we return a string indicating that there are no events to schedule. Otherwise, we extract the start and finish times for each event from the tuple and parse them using Julia's `Dates` package. We then calculate the difference between the start time and finish time for each event and check if any of these differences is negative (i.e., if the finish time occurs before the start time). If there are any such conflicts, we return a string indicating that there is a conflict in scheduling. Otherwise, we return a string indicating that there are no conflicts.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input list of events is a valid list of tuples with start and finish times in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. If the input list contains invalid dates or time formats, the `event_scheduler` function may produce incorrect results or throw errors.","status":200,"tokens":[0,401],"elapsed":3.460562938,"_type":"aimessage"}]
