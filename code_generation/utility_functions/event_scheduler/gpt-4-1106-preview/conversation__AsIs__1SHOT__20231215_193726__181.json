[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Since you mentioned using the \"Dates\" package, I assume you might be referring to the `datetime` module in Python, which is commonly used for handling dates and times. Here's the function:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef parse_event(event):\n    # Helper function to parse the start and end times of an event\n    start, end = event\n    start_dt = datetime.strptime(start, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n    end_dt = datetime.strptime(end, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')\n    return start_dt, end_dt\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n\n    # Parse the events and sort them by start time\n    parsed_events = [parse_event(event) for event in events]\n    parsed_events.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in range(len(parsed_events) - 1):\n        current_event_end = parsed_events[i][1]\n        next_event_start = parsed_events[i + 1][0]\n        if current_event_end > next_event_start:\n            return \"Conflict\"\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [\n    ('2023-04-01 09:00', '2023-04-01 11:00'),\n    ('2023-04-01 11:00', '2023-04-01 13:00'),\n    ('2023-04-01 13:30', '2023-04-01 14:30')\n]\n\nprint(event_scheduler(events))  # Should print \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of events is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. If there are events, it parses the start and end times into `datetime` objects and sorts the list of events based on the start times. It then iterates through the sorted events to check for any overlaps. If an overlap is found, it returns \"Conflict\". If no overlaps are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[108,440],"elapsed":38.075392291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
