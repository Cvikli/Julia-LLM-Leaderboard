Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the `event_scheduler` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    # Convert the event start and finish times to DateTime and sort by start times\n    sorted_events = sort([(DateTime(event[1]), DateTime(event[2])) for event in events])\n\n    # Check for conflicts by comparing the finish time of the current event\n    # with the start time of the next event\n    for i in 1:length(sorted_events)-1\n        if sorted_events[i][2] > sorted_events[i+1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function will first handle the case of an empty list. Then, it will parse the event times into `DateTime` objects using the Dates package, sort them by start times, and check for any overlaps.","status":200,"tokens":[146,192],"elapsed":9.250997917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
