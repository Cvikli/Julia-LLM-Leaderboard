Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})::String\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse the event times and sort them\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start), DateTime(finish)) for (start, finish) in events]\n    sort!(parsed_events, by=x -> x[1])\n    \n    # Check for conflicts\n    for i in 1:(length(parsed_events) - 1)\n        if parsed_events[i][2] > parsed_events[i + 1][1]\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that the function assumes that events are represented with a start time that is before the finish time and that the inputs are in proper 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' format.
