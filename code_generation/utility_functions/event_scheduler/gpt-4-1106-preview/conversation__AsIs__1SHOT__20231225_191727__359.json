To parse the dates and times, we can use the `datetime` module which is a standard module in Python for handling dates and times. Here is an implementation of your function:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef parse_event(event):\n    # Helper function to parse an event tuple into start and end datetime objects.\n    start, end = event\n    format_str = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'\n    return datetime.strptime(start, format_str), datetime.strptime(end, format_str)\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    # Check for an empty list first\n    if not events:\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    # Sort the events by their start times\n    events.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    # Parse the first event\n    previous_start, previous_end = parse_event(events[0])\n    \n    # Compare each event with the previous one to check for overlap\n    for current_event in events[1:]:\n        current_start, current_end = parse_event(current_event)\n        \n        # If the current event starts before the previous event finishes, there's a conflict.\n        if current_start < previous_end:\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        \n        # Update the previous event end time\n        previous_end = max(previous_end, current_end)\n    \n    # If we didn't find any conflicts, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [\n    ('2023-04-01 10:00', '2023-04-01 11:00'),\n    ('2023-04-01 11:30', '2023-04-01 12:30'),\n]\n\nprint(event_scheduler(events))\n```\n\nThis function will work as long as you provide it with a list of events in the correct format. It first sorts all the events by their start times, then it iterates through each event to check for overlapping with the end time of the previous event. If it finds an overlap, it will return \"Conflict\". If it does not find any overlaps after going through all the events, it will return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[108,447],"elapsed":16.597165875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
