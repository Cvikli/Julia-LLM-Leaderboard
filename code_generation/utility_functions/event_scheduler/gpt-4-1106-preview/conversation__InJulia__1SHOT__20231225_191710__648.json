After parsing, you can compare the start and end times of each event to check for overlaps. Here's a function that does that:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Array{Tuple{String, String}, 1})\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    # Parse the events and store in a new list\n    parsed_events = [(DateTime(start, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\"), DateTime(finish, \"yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM\")) for (start, finish) in events]\n\n    # Sort the events based on start date\n    sort!(parsed_events, by = x -> x[1])\n\n    # Check for conflicts in the sorted list\n    for i in 1:(length(parsed_events) - 1)\n        current_event_end = parsed_events[i][2]\n        next_event_start = parsed_events[i + 1][1]\n        if current_event_end > next_event_start\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    # If no overlaps are found, return \"No conflicts\"\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-04-01 09:00\", \"2023-04-01 11:00\"),\n    (\"2023-04-01 12:00\", \"2023-04-01 13:00\"),\n    (\"2023-04-01 13:30\", \"2023-04-01 14:30\")\n]\n\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))  # Should print \"No conflicts\"\n\n# This should print \"Conflict\" because the first and second event overlap\nprintln(event_scheduler([\n    (\"2023-04-01 09:00\", \"2023-04-01 11:00\"),\n    (\"2023-04-01 10:00\", \"2023-04-01 12:00\")\n]))\n```\n\nWhen you call the `event_scheduler` function, it first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if that's the case. Otherwise, it parses all dates and stores them in the `parsed_events` array as tuples of DateTime objects. Then, it sorts these events by their start times to facilitate an easier comparison for conflicts. Finally, the function iterates through the sorted events to check for overlaps in the time intervals; if it discovers any, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[111,536],"elapsed":19.009652541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
