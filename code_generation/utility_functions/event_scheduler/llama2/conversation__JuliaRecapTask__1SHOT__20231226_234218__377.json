X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

I'm excited to help you with your Julia programming task. To ensure that my solutions are accurate and efficient, I will follow a systematic approach. Here are the steps I will take:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Package Dates for parsing dates\n\t* Control structures (if-elseif-else, if-else)\n\t* Functions ( anonymous function, function with named arguments)\n\t* Array slicing and indexing\n\t* Tuples and dictionaries\n2.

Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Use additional checks to ensure that the solution is correct and efficient\n\t* Test the function with different inputs to ensure it is working correctly\n\nNow, let's get started!
