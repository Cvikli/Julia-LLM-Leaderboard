Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

As a world-class Julia programmer, I will approach this problem using a systematic and structured approach. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nStep 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets (5 minutes)\n\nI will quickly review the Julia language syntax and key features that may be useful for solving this task. These include:\n\n* Variables `x = 10`\n* Control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`\n* Functions `function f(x) end` and anonymous functions `x -> x^2`\n* Arrays `[1, 2, 3]` and slicing `a[1:2]`\n* Tuples `(1, 2)` and namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`\n* Dictionaries `Dict(\"key\" => value)` and `$` for string interpolation.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task (30 minutes)\n\nI will write a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events as input, parses them using the `Dates` package, and checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. If there are no overlapping events, the function will return \"No conflicts\". Otherwise, it will return \"Conflict\".\n\nStep 3: Double-check Solution (5 minutes)\n\nI will thoroughly review my solution to ensure that it is correct and meets all of the requirements specified in the problem. I will also test my solution with a few sample inputs to ensure that it works as expected.\n\nStep 4: Implement Special Instructions (if any) (15 minutes)\n\nIf there are any special instructions provided, such as using a specific package or avoiding certain features, I will prioritize them over the general guidelines and adapt my solution accordingly.\n\nTotal estimated time: 60 minutes","status":200,"tokens":[11,412],"elapsed":15.199385917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
