Here's a possible implementation of `event_scheduler` in Python using the `Dates` module:\n```\nimport datetime\nfrom dates import Date, Time\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.\n\n    Args:\n        events (list[tuple]): List of events in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: Either 'No conflicts' or 'Conflict' if there are any overlapping events.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a dictionary to store the events and their start times\n    event_start_times = {}\n    for event in events:\n        event_start_times[event[0]] = event[1]\n\n    # Loop through the events and check for overlaps\n    for event in events:\n        start_time = event_start_times[event[0]]\n        end_time = event[1]\n        if any(start_time < time <= end_time for time in event_start_times.keys()):\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    # If no overlaps were found, return 'No conflicts'\n    return \"No conflicts\"\n\n# Example usage:\nevents = [\n    (\"2023-03-15\", \"10:00\"),\n    (\"2023-03-15\", \"11:00\"),\n    (\"2023-03-16\", \"12:00\"),\n]\nprint(event_scheduler(events))  # Output: No conflicts\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It takes a list of events as input, where each event is represented as a tuple containing the date and time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.\n2. It initializes a dictionary `event_start_times` to store the start times of the events.\n3. It loops through the list of events again, using a generator expression to check for overlaps. For each event, it checks if any other event starts before its end time. If there is an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\".\n4. If no overlaps were found, it returns \"No conflicts\".\n\nIn the example usage above, there are no overlapping events, so the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[112,532],"elapsed":18.712575959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
