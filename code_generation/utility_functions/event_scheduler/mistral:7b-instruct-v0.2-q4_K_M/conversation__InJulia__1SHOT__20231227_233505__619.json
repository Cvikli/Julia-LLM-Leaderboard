Here is an example implementation:\n\n```julia using Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by=x->parse(\"$(x[1]) $(x[2])\", Dates.Format(:date_time)))\n\n    prev_end::Union{Nothing, DateTime} = nothing\n\n    for event in sorted_events\n        start = parse(\"$(event[1]) $(event[2])\", Dates.Format(:date_time))\n        end = start + Duration(hour=parse(Int, split(event[2], \" \")[2]))\n\n        if !isempty(prev_end) && (end < prev_end || prev_end > end)\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n\n        prev_end = end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis `event_scheduler` function takes a vector of tuples as its argument, where each tuple represents an event with a start and finish time. It first checks if the list is empty and returns \"No events\" if it is. Then, it sorts the events based on their start times using the provided `Dates.Format(:date_time)` format specifier.\n\nThe function then iterates through the sorted list of events and checks for any scheduling conflicts. If a conflict is detected, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues processing the remaining events until all events have been checked. Finally, it returns \"No conflicts\" if no conflicts were found.","status":200,"tokens":[119,398],"elapsed":16.142356041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
