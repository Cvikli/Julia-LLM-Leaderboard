Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia using Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events :: AbstractVector{Tuple})\n    isconflict = false\n     if length(events) < 1\n         return \"No events\"\n     end\n      sort!(events, lt = (a, b) -> a[1] < b[1])\n        for i in 2:length(events)\n            if start(events[i]) < end(events[i-1])\n                isconflict = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n         isconflict ? \"Conflict\" : \"No conflicts\"\n end\n function start(event :: Tuple)\n     Dates.parse(event[1])\n end\n function end(event :: Tuple)\n     Dates.parse(event[2]) + Duration(hours = 8) # assuming each event lasts for 8 hours\n end\n```\nThis `event_scheduler` function takes a list of events as an argument, checks for any scheduling conflicts, and returns the appropriate message accordingly. The function uses the `Dates` package for parsing date strings into `DateTime` objects and sorts the events in ascending order based on their start times to simplify the conflict detection logic.","status":200,"tokens":[160,277],"elapsed":11.573368458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
