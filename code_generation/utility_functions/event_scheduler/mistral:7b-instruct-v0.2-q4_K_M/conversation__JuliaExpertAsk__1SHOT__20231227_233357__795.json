It first removes empty tuples from the input, then sorts the events based on their start times. Then it iterates through the sorted list checking if the finish time of the previous event is less than or equal to the start time of the next event. If there is an overlap, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it continues until all events have been checked and returns \"No conflicts\" if no conflicts were found.","status":200,"tokens":[160,274],"elapsed":11.451340208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
