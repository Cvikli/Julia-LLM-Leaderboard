Here's the code to accomplish that:\n\n```julia using Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple})\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n    \n    sorted_events = sort!(events, by = x -> parse(DateTime, x[1]))\n    \n    previous_event_end = DateTime(\"0001-01-01 00:00:00\")\n    \n    for current_event in sorted_events\n        start_time = parse(DateTime, current_event[1])\n        end_time = parse(DateTime, current_event[2])\n        \n        if start_time < previous_event_end || previous_event_end < end_time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        \n        previous_event_end = end_time\n    end\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a list of events (as a vector of tuples) and checks for any scheduling conflicts. The function sorts the events based on their start time, compares each event's start time with the end time of the previous event, and returns \"Conflict\" if there is an overlap. If all events have unique start and end times, it will return \"No conflicts\". Additionally, the base case of an empty list is handled by returning \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[119,345],"elapsed":14.044561292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
