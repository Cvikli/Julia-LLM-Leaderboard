X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Import Dates package for parsing dates\n   - Use anonymous functions for event_scheduler\n   - Check for conflicts in the scheduler function\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::AbstractArray{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}})\n    isconflict(start_event, finish_event) = start_event > finish_event\n\n    scheduler(events) = any(isconflict.(events .> shiftarray(events, 1)))\n\n    if length(events) == 0\n        return \"No events\"\n    elseif scheduler(events)\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `event_scheduler` function accepts an array of tuples as its argument, where each tuple represents an event with a start and finish time in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'. The function uses the Dates package to parse the dates. It checks for any scheduling conflicts by comparing the starting time of each event with the finishing time of the next event. If there is an overlap (conflict), it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\". If there are no events in the input list, it returns \"No events\".","status":200,"tokens":[427,344],"elapsed":16.123554666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
