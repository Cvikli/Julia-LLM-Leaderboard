Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

Think through my approach step by step:\n   - First, I will create a function to parse dates and times from strings using Dates package.\n   - Next, I will sort the input events based on their start times.\n   - Then, I will check for conflicts between consecutive events in the sorted list. If any conflict is found, return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, return \"No conflicts\" if all events have been checked.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\n```julia using Dates\n\nfunction parse_event(event)\n    start = DateTime(event[1])\n    finish = DateTime(event[2])\n    return (start, finish)\nend\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    if isempty(events)\n        return \"No events\"\n    end\n\n    parsed_events = map(parse_event, events)\n    sorted_events = sort!(parsed_events; by = x -> x.start)\n\n    for i in 2:length(sorted_events)\n        if sorted_events[i].start < sorted_events[i - 1].finish\n            return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n    end\n\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\nSince the given example has conflicting events, the output should be \"Conflict\". Let's test with some other examples as well to ensure the function works correctly for various cases:\n\n```julia event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 13:00\")])\nevent_scheduler([])\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 10:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 10:30\", \"2023-12-01 11:30\")])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[307,620],"elapsed":26.622701625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
