If the list is empty, it returns \"No events\". It uses a dictionary to keep track of scheduled events based on their start time (as keys) and stores each event as a value. For each new event, it checks if there are any scheduling conflicts with existing events in the dictionary by checking for overlapping times. If there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\". Otherwise, it adds the new event to the dictionary and continues checking the next event. If no conflicts are found, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[119,384],"elapsed":15.592606292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
