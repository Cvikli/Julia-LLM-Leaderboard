Think through the approach:\n   We need to compare each pair of events and check if they have any overlapping time. If there is an overlap, we will return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, we will continue checking all pairs. If no conflicts are found, we will return \"No conflicts\".\n\n2. Write functions and other code:\n   To parse the dates, we'll use the Dates package. Let's define a helper function to parse the date strings into DateTime objects.\n\n3. ```julia\n   using Dates\n\n   function parse_datetime(date_str)\n       year, month, day, hour, minute = split(date_str, \"-\")\n       return DateTime(Year(parseint(year)), Month(parseint(month)), Day(parseint(day)), Hour(parseint(hour)), Minute(parseint(minute)))\n   end\n\n   function event_scheduler(events)\n       if isempty(events)\n           return \"No events\"\n       end\n\n       for i in 1:length(events)-1\n           start_i, end_i = parse_datetime.(event_sponsors(events[i]))\n           for j in i+1:length(events)\n               start_j, end_j = parse_datetime.(event_sponsors(events[j]))\n               if start_i <= end_j && end_i >= start_j\n                   return \"Conflict\"\n               end\n           end\n       end\n\n       return \"No conflicts\"\n   end\n\n   function event_sponsors(event)\n      return (event[1], event[2])\n   end\n   ```\n   \n4. Solve the task:\n   The `parse_datetime` function is used to parse the date strings and convert them into DateTime objects. The main logic for checking conflicts between events is implemented in the `event_scheduler` function using a nested loop.\n\n5. Check that the solution is correct:\n   To ensure the code works correctly, we can test it with various inputs:\n   \n   ```julia\n   event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]) # Conflict\n   event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 12:00\", \"2023-12-01 14:00\")]) # No conflicts\n   event_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:00\", \"2023-12-01 12:00\")]) # Conflict\n   event_scheduler([]) # No events\n   ```","status":200,"tokens":[307,744],"elapsed":31.840571,"_type":"aimessage"}]
