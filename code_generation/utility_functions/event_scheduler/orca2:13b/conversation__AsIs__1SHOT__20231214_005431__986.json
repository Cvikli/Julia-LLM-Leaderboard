Here's a function `event_scheduler` that checks for scheduling conflicts among a list of events:\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport dates\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    # Get the start and finish times for each event\n    for event in events:\n        start = event[0]\n        finish = event[1]\n        \n    # Create a dictionary of events with their start and finish times as keys\n    schedule = {start: [], finish: []}\n    for event in events:\n        schedule[event[0]].append(event[1])\n    \n    # Check for overlapping events\n    conflicting_events = []\n    for start, finish in schedule.items():\n        if len(schedule[start]) > 1:\n            conflicting_events.append((start, finish))\n    return \"No conflicts\" if not conflicting_events else \"Conflict\"\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. First, we loop through the list of events and extract the start and finish times for each event using slicing (`event[0]` and `event[1]`).\n2. Next, we create a dictionary called `schedule` where the keys are the start and finish times, and the values are lists of all the events that overlap with each time slot. We do this by iterating over the list of events again and appending the events to their corresponding time slots in the `schedule` dictionary.\n3. Then, we use a loop to check for overlapping events. For each start time, we check if there are more than one event that overlap with it. If there are, we append the start and finish times of those events to the `conflicting_events` list.\n4. Finally, we return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events, or \"Conflict\" if there are any.\n\nNote: The function uses the `dates` module to parse the start and finish times in the format `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'`.","status":200,"tokens":[107,466],"elapsed":16.265620541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
