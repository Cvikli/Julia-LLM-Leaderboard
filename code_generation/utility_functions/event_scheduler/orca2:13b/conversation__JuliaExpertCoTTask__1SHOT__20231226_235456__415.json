Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Steps\n\n1. Define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of tuples as an argument.\n2. Initialize an empty set called `conflicts` to store the overlapping events.\n3.
