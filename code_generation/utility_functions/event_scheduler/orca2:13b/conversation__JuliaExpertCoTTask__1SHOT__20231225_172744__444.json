From 09:00 to 11:00 on December 1, 2023.\n2. From 11:30 to 12:30 on December 1, 2023.\n\nThe first event does not overlap with the second event since there is a gap between 11:00 and 11:30. Therefore, the function returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[313,899],"elapsed":66.0560755,"_type":"aimessage"}]
