[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').

Then, we'll create a function named `event_scheduler` that takes in a list of events and returns whether there is any scheduling conflict among those events or not.\n\n1. Install the Dates package:\n```bash\njulia>using Dates\n```\n1.

Then, we check if there are any events in the list and return \"No events\" if so.\n* If not, we sort the events by finish time (in ascending order) to simplify our conflict detection process.\n* We then iterate over each event in reverse order of sorting. For each event, we check for conflicts with both the previous and next events (if they exist). A conflict occurs when two events overlap in time. The flag `conflict` is used to track whether a conflict has been detected.\n* If a conflict is found, we sort the events again to ensure that overlapping events are adjacent.\n* Finally, we check for conflicts within the same day and return \"Conflict\" if any are found; otherwise, we return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[411,797],"elapsed":17.888918375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
