[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of events where each event is a tuple with a start and a finish time (in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'). Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events.

We'll implement a simple greedy algorithm to check for scheduling conflicts: if an event starts after another event's end time, then these events overlap and there is a conflict.\n\nFirst, let's import the necessary packages and define the function signature:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Tuple{Tuple{DateTime, DateTime}}) where T<:Ord\n# Convert all start times to Julian Day numbers\nstart_times = [utc_to_jd(event_1) for event_1 in @curry(events .*) ]\n\n# Sort events by their end time (not inclusive)\nend_times = sort!(reverse=true, by=(:julian_day => start_times))\n\n# Check if any event overlaps with another one\nfor i in 2:length(start_times), j in 1:(i-1):=length(start_times) + 1 ->\nif start_times[i] >= end_times[j - 1]\nreturn \"Conflict\"\nend\nend\n\n# If we've checked all events and found no overlaps, return \"No conflicts\"\nreturn \"No conflict\"\nend\n```\nNow you can use this function with a list of event tuples:\n```julia\nevents = [\n(2021-06-01 15:30, 2021-06-02 16:45),\n(2021-06-03 09:15, 2021-06-04 10:30)\n]\n\nresult = event_scheduler(events)\nprintln(result)# Output: No conflict\n```","status":200,"tokens":[126,384],"elapsed":7.042111834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
