Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of the `event_scheduler` function using the Dates package for date and time manipulation:\n```python\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\nif isempty(events)\nreturn \"No events\"\nend\n\nstart_times = map(parse, split(join(format(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\", ...), \", \"*len(events)-1)))\nfinish_times = map(parse, split(join(format(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M}\", ...), \", *len(events)\", \"-1\"), \"\\n\"))\n\nscheduled_events = [start_times[i] | addhours(finish_times[i], events[i][1]) for I in range(#length(events))]\nconflicts = any(scheduled_events[i] >= scheduled_events[j] for I, J in combinations(range(len(scheduled_events)), 2))\n\nif conflicts\nreturn \"Conflict\"\nelse\nreturn \"No conflicts\"\nend\nend\n```\nThis function works by:\n1.

Creating a list of scheduled start times and adding the corresponding end time to each element, resulting in the actual scheduling for each event.\n3. Checking if any two events overlap by generating all possible combinations of two events (using `combinations`) and checking if their scheduled start times are greater than or equal to each other's scheduled start times. If there is a conflict, it returns \"Conflict\"; otherwise, it returns \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[278,365],"elapsed":10.03528375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
