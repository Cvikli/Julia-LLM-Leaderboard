If it is, then we return the string \"No events\". Otherwise, we iterate through all pairs of consecutive events in the list and check for overlapping times using the Dates package's parsing capabilities.\n\nIf there are any overlapping start or finish times between two consecutive events, we return the string \"Conflict\". If no conflicts are found, we return the string \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[128,398],"elapsed":12.604953291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
