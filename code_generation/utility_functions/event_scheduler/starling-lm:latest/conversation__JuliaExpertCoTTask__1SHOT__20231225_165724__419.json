First, we need to parse the start and finish times from the given tuples. We can use Julia's `Date` package to achieve this. \n2. Next, we need to compare the timings of each pair of events. If any two events overlap in time, we return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, we proceed to step 3.\n3. If no conflicts are found, we return \"No conflicts\". If there are no events, we also return \"No events\".\n4. Finally, we define and implement the `event_scheduler` function according to these steps. \n\nHere's a Julia implementation of the solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    # Step 1: Parse start and finish times from tuples\n    parsed_times = []\n    for (start, end_) in events\n        start_time = parse(DateTime, start)\n        end_time = parse(DateTime, end_)\n        push!(parsed_times, (start_time, end_time))\n    end\n\n    # Step 2: Compare the timings of each pair of events\n    for i in 1:length(events)-1\n        for j in i+1:length(events)\n            if overlaps(parsed_times[i][1], parsed_times[i][2], parsed_times[j][1], parsed_times[j][2])\n                # Step 3: If two events overlap, return \"Conflict\"\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Step 4: If no conflicts are found, return \"No conflicts\"\n    # If there are no events, also return \"No events\"\n    length(events) == 0 ? \"No events\" : \"No conflicts\"\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\n\nThis code defines and implements the `event_scheduler` function that solves the task according to the outlined steps.","status":200,"tokens":[316,542],"elapsed":18.334668042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
