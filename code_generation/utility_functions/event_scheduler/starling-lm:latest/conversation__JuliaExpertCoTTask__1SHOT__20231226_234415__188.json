Start by importing the Dates package since it'll be used for parsing the timestamps in the events. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```\n\n2. Define the `event_scheduler` function which takes a list of tuples as its argument:\n\n```julia\nfunction event_scheduler(events::Vector{Tuple{String, String}})::String\n```\n\n3. Initialize an empty `conflicts` variable to keep track of any overlapping events.\n\n4. Iterate through all the events and for each pair of events, parse their start and finish times into `DateAndTime` objects:\n\n```julia\n    for i in 1:length(events)\n        for j in (i+1):length(events)\n            start_time1, end_time1 = parse.(Dates.DateAndTime, split(events[i][1], \" \"))\n            start_time2, end_time2 = parse.(Dates.DateAndTime, split(events[j][1], \" \"))\n```\n\n5. Check if the events overlap in time. If they do, mark a conflict:\n\n```julia\n            if start_time1 <= end_time2 && start_time2 <= end_time1\n                conflicts = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n    end\n```\n\n6. After checking all pairs of events, if any `conflicts` were detected, return \"Conflict\". Otherwise, return \"No conflicts\":\n\n```julia\n    if conflicts\n        return \"Conflict\"\n    else\n        return \"No conflicts\"\n    end\nend\n```\n\n7. Test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"], [\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\"])\n```\n\nThis function will return `\"Conflict\"` since the two events overlap.","status":200,"tokens":[316,522],"elapsed":22.960589875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
