Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\". Use package Dates for parsing.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my solution to the problem:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler(events) =\n    if length(events) == 0\n        \"No events\"\n    else\n        for i in 1:length(events)\n            start, finish = events[i]\n            if any(start <= ft < finish || ft <= start < finish)\n                return \"Conflict\"\n        end\n        \"No conflicts\"\n    end\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes a list of events as input.\n* We first check if the list is empty, and return a string message accordingly.\n* Otherwise, we iterate through the list of events using a for loop.\n* For each event, we check if there are any overlapping events by checking if the finish time of the current event is earlier than the start time of the next event, or vice versa. If there is an overlap, we return \"Conflict\".\n* If there are no overlaps, we return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\nevent_scheduler([(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")])\n```\nThis should return \"No conflicts\".","status":200,"tokens":[300,338],"elapsed":14.26141575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
