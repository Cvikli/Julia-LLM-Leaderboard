Write a function `event_scheduler` that checks for any scheduling conflicts among the events. The function should return \"No conflicts\" if there are no overlapping events and \"Conflict\" if any events overlap in time. If the list is empty, return \"No events\".

We import it using `using Dates`.\n\nStep 2: Define the event_scheduler function that takes a list of tuples as input.\nThe function will iterate through each tuple and convert the start and end times to datetime objects using `DateTime(start, end)`. It will then compare these datetime objects to check for any overlapping events. If an overlap is found, it will return \"Conflict\". If no overlap is found, it will return \"No conflicts\". If the list is empty, it will return \"No events\".\n\nHere's the Julia code implementing this solution:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction event_scheduler(events)\n    for (start, end) in events\n        start = DateTime(start)\n        end = DateTime(end)\n        \n        for (event_start, event_end) in events\n            if start <= event_start && event_start < end || \n               start < event_end && event_end <= end\n                return \"Conflict\"\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return \"No conflicts\"\nend\n```\n\nStep 3: Test the function with the provided data.\nWe can test our function by calling `event_scheduler` with the given list of events:\n```julia\nevents = [(\"2023-12-01 09:00\", \"2023-12-01 11:00\"), (\"2023-12-01 11:30\", \"2023-12-01 12:30\")]\nprintln(event_scheduler(events))\n```\nThe output will be \"Conflict\" since there is an overlap between the first and second events.","status":200,"tokens":[316,442],"elapsed":20.47891425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
