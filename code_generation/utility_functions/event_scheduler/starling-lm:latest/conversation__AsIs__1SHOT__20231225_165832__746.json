Import the necessary package Dates to parse the dates and times.\n2. Define a function `event_scheduler` that takes a list of events as input.\n3. Check if the input list is empty, if so, return \"No events\".\n4. Sort the events based on their start times.\n5. Iterate through the sorted events and check for any overlapping events. If an overlap is found, return \"Conflict\".\n6. If no conflicts are found after iterating through all the events, return \"No conflicts\".\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the `event_scheduler` function:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dateutil.parser import parse\n\ndef event_scheduler(events):\n    if not events:  # If the list is empty, return \"No events\"\n        return \"No events\"\n    \n    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort the events based on their start times\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_events) - 1):\n        start, finish = sorted_events[i]\n        next_start, _ = sorted_events[i + 1]  # Get the next event's start time\n        \n        if (parse(next_start).timestamp() < parse(finish).timestamp()):  # Check for overlap in time\n            return \"Conflict\"\n    \n    return \"No conflicts\"\n```\n\nYou can use this `event_scheduler` function to check for scheduling conflicts among the events.","status":200,"tokens":[125,361],"elapsed":11.414463,"_type":"aimessage"}]
