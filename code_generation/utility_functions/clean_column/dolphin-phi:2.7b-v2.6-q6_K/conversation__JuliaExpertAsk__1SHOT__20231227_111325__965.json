The third argument to `translate` is a set of mappings, where each mapping consists of two elements: the character to be replaced (e.g., ' ', '-'), and the character that will replace it (e.g., '_' in this case).\n\nThis function takes an input column name (`col`) and returns a cleaned version of the name, as specified by your requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[115,231],"elapsed":6.157282375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
