If the character is not a whitespace, it gets added to a `StringBuilder`. After all characters have been processed, the function converts the StringBuilder into a new string and then lowercases it. The `toString()` method returns a new string that represents this string object.\n\nThis function will return `\"My Column\"` as `\"My_Column\"`, but `lowercase(\"My _COLUMN\")` would give you `\"my_column\"`.\n\nNote: This function does not handle hyphens in a way that matches the expected behavior of replacing spaces and hyphens with an underscore. If this is required, additional logic would need to be added to the function.","status":200,"tokens":[115,273],"elapsed":7.248327708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
