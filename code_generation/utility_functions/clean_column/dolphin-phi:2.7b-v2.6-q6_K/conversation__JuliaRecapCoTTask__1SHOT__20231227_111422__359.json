[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In this task, we are asked to write a function `clean_column` that cleans the given column name. Here is how I would approach this problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\nclean_name = lowercase(stripwhitespace(replace(col, \"[ -]\", \"_\")))\nreturn clean_name\nend\n```\nIn the function `clean_column`, we are using the following Julia syntax:\n- `lowercase(string)`: This function converts the input string to lowercase. It takes a single argument which is a string and returns a new string with all characters in lowercase.\n- `stripwhitespace(string)`: This function removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the input string. It takes a single argument which is a string and returns a new string with no leading or trailing whitespaces.\n- `replace(string, pattern, replacement)`: This function replaces all occurrences of the specified pattern in the input string with the specified replacement string. It takes three arguments - `string`, `pattern`, and `replacement` - where `string` is the input string, `pattern` is a regular expression pattern to match, and `replacement` is the new string that will replace all matched patterns.\n\nThis function should meet the requirements of the problem by properly cleaning the column name according to the specified instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[367,301],"elapsed":9.24836725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
