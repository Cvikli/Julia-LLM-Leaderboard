For example, `\"My Column\"` becomes `\"my column\"`.\n2. `strip`: This function removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from a string. For example, `\" My Column \"` becomes `\"My Column\"`.\n3. `replace`: This function replaces all occurrences of the first argument (a pattern) with the second argument (a replacement). In this case, we're replacing any spaces or hyphens with an underscore. So `\"My-Column\"` becomes `\"my_column\"`, and `\"My Column\"` becomes `\"my_column\"`.\n4. The `|>` symbol is called a \"pipe\" operator. It allows us to chain multiple functions together in a way that's easier to read than nesting them inside each other. In this case, we're taking the output of `lowercase` and piping it into `replace`, which returns the final cleaned column name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,300],"elapsed":8.313547204,"_type":"aimessage"}]
