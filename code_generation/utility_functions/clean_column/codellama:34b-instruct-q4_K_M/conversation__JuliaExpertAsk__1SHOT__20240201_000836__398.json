This is useful for documentation and can help prevent errors.\n2. The `lowercase()` function converts the column name to lowercase, making it easier to work with.\n3. The `strip()` function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the column name. This helps ensure that we don't accidentally include spaces in our new column name.\n4. The `replace()` function replaces any spaces or hyphens in the column name with an underscore. We use a regular expression (i.e., `r\"[\\s-]\"`) to match these characters, and `_` as the replacement string. This helps make the column name more readable and easier to work with in Julia.\n5. Finally, we return the cleaned column name as a string using the `::String` type annotation.\n\nNote that this function assumes you're working with strings (i.e., `AbstractString`) for your column names. If you have a different data type, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[108,327],"elapsed":9.397450252,"_type":"aimessage"}]
