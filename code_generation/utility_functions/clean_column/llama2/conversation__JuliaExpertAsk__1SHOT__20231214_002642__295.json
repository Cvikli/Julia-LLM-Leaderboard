Here is a function `clean_column` that meets your requirements:\n```julia\nclean_column(col) = lowercase(trim(sub(\" \\\\*\\\\h $\", \"_\"), col))\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `lowercase(trim(sub(\" \\\\*\\\\h $\", \"_\"), col))` uses the `lowercase` function to convert the column name to lowercase, and then uses the `trim` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n* The `sub` function is used to replace any spaces and hyphens in the column name with an underscore. The regular expression `\" \\\\*\\\\h $\"` matches any space or hyphen character, and replaces them with an underscore.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input column name is a string. If the input is a vector of strings, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[108,195],"elapsed":6.950898417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
