[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! I'm ready to help you solve the task. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nStep 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets\n\nI will recall the following useful Julia snippets that can be applied to the task at hand:\n\n* Lowercasing a string: `lowercase(col)`\n* Stripping leading and trailing spaces: `col |> strip()`\n* Replacing spaces and hyphens with an underscore: `replace(col, \" [ ]\", \"_\")`\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task\n\nUsing the snippets recalled in Step 1, I will write a function `clean_column` that performs the desired cleaning of the column name. Here is the implementation:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    lowercase(col) |> strip() |> replace(col, \" [ ]\", \"_\")\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-Check Solution Correctness\n\nTo ensure that the solution is correct, I will test it with a few examples and verify that the output is as expected. Here are some example inputs and their corresponding outputs:\n\n* `clean_column(\"My Column\")` should output `\"my_column\"`\n* `clean_column(\" My Column \")` should output `\"my_column\"`\n* `clean_column(\"-My Column-\")` should output `\"my_column\"`\n\nIf the above tests pass, we can confirm that the function is working correctly.\n\nPlease provide any Special Instructions you have, if any.","status":200,"tokens":[1,339],"elapsed":12.058360084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
