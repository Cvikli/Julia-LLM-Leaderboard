Here is a possible implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return lc(trim(sub(col, \" \\\\*$\", \"_\"), \" \"); # lowercase, trim leading/trailing spaces, replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `lc()` converts the input string to lowercase.\n* `trim()` removes leading and trailing spaces from the input string.\n* The `sub()` function replaces all occurrences of spaces and hyphens in the input string with an underscore. The regular expression ` \" \\\\*$\"` matches any space or hyphen, and the substitution ` \"_` replaces them with an underscore.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[1,184],"elapsed":5.85732925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
