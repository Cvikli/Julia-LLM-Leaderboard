X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's start solving the task using our systematic approach.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* Lowercasing a string with `string.lowercase()` function.\n\t* Stripping leading and trailing whitespaces with `string.rstrip()` function.\n\t* Replacing spaces and hyphens with an underscore using regular expression substitution with `sub()` function.\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Write a function `clean_column(col)` that takes a column name as input and returns its cleaned version.\n\t* Use the recallered snippets to implement the function.\n\t* Here's an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return string.lowercase(string.rstrip(col, \" \"); colreplace(col, \"-\", \"_\"));\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with different input column names and verify that the output is as expected.\n\t* Here are some test cases to try:\n\t\t+ `clean_column(\"My Column\")` should output `\"my_column\"`\n\t\t+ `clean_column(\"My   Column\")` should output `\"my_column\"`\n\t\t+ `clean_column(\"- My Column\")` should output `\"my_column\"`\n\t\t+ `clean_column(\"My   Column   \")` should output `\"my_column\"`\n4. Implement any additional Special Instructions provided by the user, if any.\n\nNote: In Julia, we use the `$` symbol for string interpolation, which is a more concise and safer alternative to Python's `format()` method. Also, we prefer using general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to avoid being too restrictive and emphasize performance, clarity, and abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.","status":200,"tokens":[379,426],"elapsed":18.733587167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
