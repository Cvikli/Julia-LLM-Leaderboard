[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started on the task at hand. Based on the problem statement and guidelines provided, here are the steps I will follow to solve this task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Lowercasing a string: `lowercase(col)`\n\t* Stripping leading/trailing whitespaces: `col = replace(col, r\"\\s\", \"\")`\n\t* Replacing spaces and hyphens with an underscore: `col = replace(col, \" \", \"_\")`\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Write a function `clean_column(col)` that takes in the column name as input and returns the cleaned column name\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with some sample inputs to ensure it produces the expected output\n\nHere's the implemented function `clean_column`:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Lowercase the input string\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading/trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, r\"\\s\", \"\")\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, \" \", \"_\")\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\nI hope this meets your requirements!
