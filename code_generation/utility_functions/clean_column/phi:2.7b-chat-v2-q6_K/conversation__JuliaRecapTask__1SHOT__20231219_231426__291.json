[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started on the task at hand. Based on the problem statement and the Julia language guidelines you provided, here are the steps I will follow to solve the task:\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n\n* Lowercasing a string: `string.lowercase()`\n* Stripping leading/trailing whitespaces: `string.replace(r\"\\s+\", \"\")`\n* Replacing spaces and hyphens with an underscore: `string.replace(\" [A-Z]\", \"_\")`\n\nStep 2: Solve the task\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return col.lowercase()\n        .replace(r\"\\s+\", \"\")\n        .replace(\" [A-Z]\", \"_\")\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-check the solution is correct\n\nTo double-check the solution, I will test it with a few sample inputs and check if the output is as expected. Here are some examples:\n\n* `clean_column(\"My Column\")` should output `\"my_column\"`\n* `clean_column(\"My   Col  \")` should output `\"my_col \"_`\n* `clean_column(\"-My Col-\")` should output `\"my_col \"_`\n\nIf the test cases pass, we can confirm that the function is working correctly.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any additional special instructions or modifications to the guidelines you would like me to follow while solving the task.","status":200,"tokens":[379,351],"elapsed":15.849097792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
