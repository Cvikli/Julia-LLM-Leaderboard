Here is a possible implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = trim(col, r\" \\\")\n    return replace(col, \" \", \"_\")\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* `lowercase(col)` converts the column name to lowercase.\n* `trim(col, r\" \\\")` removes any leading or trailing spaces from the column name using a regular expression pattern. The `r` prefix indicates that we are using a raw string literals, which allows us to use backslash as a special character. The `\"\\\"` pattern matches any space character.\n* `replace(col, \" \", \"_\")` replaces any spaces in the column name with an underscore.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with the name of the column you want to clean, like this:\n```\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\nI hope this helps!
