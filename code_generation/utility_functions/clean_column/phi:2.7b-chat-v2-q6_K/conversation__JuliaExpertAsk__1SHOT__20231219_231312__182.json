Here is a possible implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = trim(col, \" \")\n    col = replace(col, \"-\", \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `lowercase(col)` converts the column name to lowercase.\n* `trim(col, \" \")` removes any leading or trailing spaces from the column name.\n* `replace(col, \"-\", \"_\")` replaces any hyphens in the column name with an underscore.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input column name is a string. If you need to work with other types of inputs (e.g., integers, arrays), you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,184],"elapsed":5.793472958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
