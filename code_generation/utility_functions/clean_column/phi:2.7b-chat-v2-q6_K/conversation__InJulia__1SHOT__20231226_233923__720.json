Each dataset has column names that are not in a consistent format. You have been tasked to create a function in Julia called `clean_column` which cleans up these column names by converting them into lowercase, removing any leading or trailing spaces and replacing hyphens and spaces with underscores. \n\nYou've also been given the following list of datasets:\n1) \"Policy Analysis - 2020\"\n2) \"Education Policy- 2018\"\n3) \"Health Care Policies - 2015\"\n4) \"Transportation Planning- 2017\"\n5) \"Environmental Policies - 2019\"\n\nQuestion: \nWrite a Julia function `clean_column` that can clean the column names of all datasets and explain your solution.\n\n\nFirst, define your Python function `clean_column` as described in the conversation above. The function should take in one argument which represents the name of a column to be cleaned.\nHere's the initial version:\nfunction clean_column($col) {\n  return lcfirst(strtr($col, \" -\", \"_\"))\n}\n\nNext, apply this `clean_column` function to each dataset by using the `map` function in Julia. This will give you a new list of cleaned column names for each dataset:\ndatasets = [\"Policy Analysis - 2020\", \"Education Policy- 2018\", \"Health Care Policies - 2015\", \"Transportation Planning- 2017\", \"Environmental Policies - 2019\"]\ncleaned_columns = map(clean_column, datasets)\n\nAnswer: \nThe function `clean_column` cleans the column names by converting them into lowercase, removing any leading or trailing spaces and replacing hyphens and spaces with underscores. When applied to each dataset, it returns a new list of cleaned column names for each dataset. The solution is as follows:\n```python\ndef clean_column(col):\nreturn lcfirst(strtr($col, \" -\", \"_\"))\ndatasets = [\"Policy Analysis - 2020\", \"Education Policy- 2018\", \"Health Care Policies - 2015\", \"Transportation Planning- 2017\", \"Environmental Policies - 2019\"]\ncleaned_columns = map(clean_column, datasets)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[72,508],"elapsed":13.297931084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
