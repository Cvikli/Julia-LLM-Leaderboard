Here is a function for cleaning a column name in Julia:\n```julia\nclean_column(col) = lowercase(trim(sub(\" \\\\* \\\\-\", \"_\"), col))\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `lowercase()` converts the input string to lowercase.\n* `trim()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string.\n* `sub()` replaces any occurrences of \" \\\\* \\\\-\" (the spaces and hyphens) with an underscore.\n\nNote: The `sub()` function takes a regular expression pattern as its argument, which in this case is a literal string consisting of the spaces and hyphens that we want to replace.","status":200,"tokens":[108,154],"elapsed":5.601335625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
