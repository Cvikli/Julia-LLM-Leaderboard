Here's an example function in Julia that does what you described:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = replace(col, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\", \"\") # strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\-\\s]\", \"_\") # replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    return col\nend\n```\nLet me explain what each line of the function does:\n\n* `lowercase(col)`: Makes the column name lowercase.\n* `replace(col, r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\", \"\")`: Strips leading and trailing whitespaces from the column name using regular expressions. The `r` prefix tells Julia that we're working with a raw string, and the `replace()` function replaces any sequences of one or more whitespace characters (`\\s`) with an empty string.\n* `replace(col, r\"[\\-\\s]\", \"_\")`: Replaces any spaces and hyphens in the column name with an underscore using regular expressions. The `r` prefix tells Julia that we're working with a raw string, and the `replace()` function replaces any occurrences of the specified characters (`[ - \\s]`) with an underscore.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with the name of the column you want to clean, like this:\n```\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[1,345],"elapsed":11.034594917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
