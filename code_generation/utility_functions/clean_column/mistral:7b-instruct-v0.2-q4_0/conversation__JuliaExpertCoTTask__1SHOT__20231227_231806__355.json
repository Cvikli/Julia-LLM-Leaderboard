We define a function `clean_column` that takes one argument `col`.\n2. Inside the function, we use `strip` and `lowercase` functions to remove leading/trailing whitespaces and lowercase the column name respectively.\n3. We use regular expressions with the `replace` function to replace any spaces or hyphens in the string with an underscore symbol.\n4. Finally, we test the function by calling it with the given data \"My Column\".","status":200,"tokens":[191,222],"elapsed":7.6676425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
