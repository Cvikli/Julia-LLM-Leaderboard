Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Lowercase the column name\n   - Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n   - Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n\n2. Write any functions and other code needed:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n\n    return col\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\nThe `clean_column` function defined above will take a column name as input, lowercase it, strip any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore.\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct:\n\nWe can test the `clean_column` function with the provided example:\n\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\n\nThe output matches the expected result, so we can be confident that the `clean_column` function works correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[193,292],"elapsed":4.014167375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
