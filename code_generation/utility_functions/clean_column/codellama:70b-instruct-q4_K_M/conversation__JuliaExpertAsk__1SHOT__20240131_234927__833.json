Let me know if you have any questions or if I can improve it!\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # lowercase and strip leading/trailing whitespace from column name\n    col = lowercase(strip(col))\n\n    # replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    return replace(col, r\"[ \\-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function on a given column name:\n\n```julia\nmy_column_name = \"My Column\"\ncleaned_column_name = clean_column(my_column_name) # returns \"my_column\"\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the input `col` is always of type `String`. If you wanted to handle other data types, such as integers or floats, then you could modify the function definition to include a type assertion. For example:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::Union{String, Int, Float64})\n    ...  # same code from above\nend\n```\n\nThis would ensure that `clean_column` only works with strings, integers, or floating-point numbers as inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[117,278],"elapsed":15.213538482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
