It first converts the string to lowercase using `lowercase()`, then strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`. Then, it replaces any spaces with underscores using `replace()` and removes any remaining hyphens from the string. Finally, it returns the cleaned column name as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":11.146820838,"_type":"aimessage"}]
