I've added comments to explain each step in the process:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Convert the column name to lowercase\n    col = lowercase(col);\n\n    # Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col);\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores using Regex (Regular Expressions)\n    return replace(col, r\"[\\s\\-]+\"=>\"_\");\nend;\n```\nUsage example: \n```julia\ncleaned_column = clean_column(\"My Column\")\nprintln(cleaned_column) # Output: my_column\n```\nPlease note that this function assumes the column name is a string. If you want to handle other data types, you can use `try` and `catch` blocks or check for specific data types before processing them with this function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,209],"elapsed":11.188955683,"_type":"aimessage"}]
