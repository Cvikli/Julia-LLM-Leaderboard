[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets the requirements of this task and takes into account the special instructions.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    col = lowercase(strip(col)) # Lowercase and strip leading/trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\") # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nThis function performs the following steps:\n\n1. **Lowercases** the input column name using `lowercase()`. This ensures that all characters are in lowercase, regardless of whether they were already lowercase or not.\n2. **Strips leading and trailing whitespaces** using `strip()` to remove any extra spaces at the beginning or end of the string.\n3. **Replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores** using `replace()`. This is done by providing a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]\"`) which matches whitespace characters (`\\s`) and hyphens (`-`), and replacing them with an underscore (`_`).\n\nThe function returns the cleaned column name as an `AbstractString`, which allows it to handle a wide range of string types, including ASCIIStrings, UTF8Strings, etc.\n\nPlease note that if the input column name is empty or contains only whitespace characters, the function will return an empty string (`\"\"`) after stripping leading and trailing whitespaces.","status":200,"tokens":[0,318],"elapsed":17.203352821,"_type":"aimessage"}]
