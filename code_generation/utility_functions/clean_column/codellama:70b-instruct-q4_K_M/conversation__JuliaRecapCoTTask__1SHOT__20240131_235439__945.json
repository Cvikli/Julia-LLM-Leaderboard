[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces from col\n    col = strip(col)\n    \n    # Convert col to lowercase\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores in col\n    col = replace(col, r\"[ \\-]+\"=>'_')\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\nThis function handles the given Task, applying the instructions you provided to clean a column name. It takes an `AbstractString` argument (so it can accept String or SubString types) and returns a cleaned version of that string with all spaces and hyphens replaced by underscores, and leading and trailing whitespaces removed.\n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation and may not handle more complex cases, such as repeated spaces/hyphens in the input string or non-ASCII characters. If you need to support these scenarios, please provide additional instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":12.260152749,"_type":"aimessage"}]
