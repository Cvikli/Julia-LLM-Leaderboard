This function assumes the column name is a string. If not, it will throw an error. It also handles any other characters that are not alphanumeric, spaces, hyphens or underscores by removing them from the final result.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase and remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    col = strip(lowercase(col))\n\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\n\n    # Remove any other characters that are not alphanumeric or an underscore\n    col = replace(col, r\"[^\\w_]\" => \"\")\n\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nThe function takes in the column name (`col`) and returns the cleaned version of it. It uses `strip` to remove leading and trailing whitespace, `lowercase` to convert all characters to lowercase, and `replace` to replace spaces and hyphens with an underscore and remove any other non-alphanumeric or underscore characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,261],"elapsed":13.983877373,"_type":"aimessage"}]
