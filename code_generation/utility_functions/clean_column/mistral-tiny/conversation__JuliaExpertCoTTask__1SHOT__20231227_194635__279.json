Here's a brief explanation of how it works:\n\n1. The function takes one argument, `col`, which represents the column name to be cleaned.\n2. The first thing the function does is convert the column name to lowercase using the `lowercase` function.\n3. Next, the function removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function.\n4. Finally, the function replaces any spaces and hyphens with underscores using a regular expression and the `replace` function.\n5. The function then returns the cleaned column name.\n6. To test the function with the provided data, we simply call it with the argument \"My Column\".","status":200,"tokens":[193,318],"elapsed":9.39796575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
