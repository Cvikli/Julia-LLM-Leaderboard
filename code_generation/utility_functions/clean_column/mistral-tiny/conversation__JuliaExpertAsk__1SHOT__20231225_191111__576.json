It uses the following Julia built-in functions:\n\n1. `lowercase`: Lowercases the given string.\n2. `strip`: Removes leading and trailing whitespaces.\n3. `replace`: Replaces all occurrences of a specified regular expression with a given string.\n4. `AbstractString`: The type of the column name argument.\n\nThe regular expression `r\"[ \\t]+|-|\\\\\\s\"` matches one or more consecutive whitespaces, hyphens, or backslashes followed by whitespaces. It is replaced with the underscore character `_`. This results in the desired column cleaning behavior you described.","status":200,"tokens":[117,223],"elapsed":2.163587958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
