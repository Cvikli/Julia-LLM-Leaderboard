Here is a function in Julia that does what you described:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = trim(col)\n    \n    # Replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, \" [^_]\") {\"_\"}\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\nLet me explain how the function works:\n\n1. `lowercase(col)`: This line converts the column name to lowercase.\n2. `trim(col)`: This line removes any leading and trailing whitespaces from the column name.\n3. `replace(col, \" [^_]\") {\"_\"}`: This line replaces any spaces and hyphens in the column name with an underscore. The `replace` function takes a pattern (in this case, any character that is not an underscore) and a replacement string (in this case, an underscore). The `[]` symbol is used to define a character class, where `[^_]` matches any character that is not an underscore.\n4. Return the cleaned-up column name: `return col`.\n\nYou can call the function like this: `clean_column(\"My Column\")`, which will return `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[79,304],"elapsed":10.237579208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
