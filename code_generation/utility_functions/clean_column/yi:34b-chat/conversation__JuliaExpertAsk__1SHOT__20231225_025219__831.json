It uses the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing whitespaces, and a custom transformation function within the `do` block to replace spaces and hyphens with underscores. The `lowercase` function is then applied to the result to ensure that the column name is lowercase.","status":200,"tokens":[117,151],"elapsed":21.788298584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
