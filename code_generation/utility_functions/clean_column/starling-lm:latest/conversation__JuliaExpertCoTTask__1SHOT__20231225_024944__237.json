First, we need to lowercase the column name using Julia's built-in `lowercase` function. This will convert all uppercase letters in the string to their lowercase equivalents. For example, \"MY COLUMN\" becomes \"my column\". \n   \n```julia\ncol = \"MY COLUMN\"\nlower_col = lowercase(col)\n```\n\n2. Next, we need to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the string using Julia's `strip` function. This will eliminate any spaces at the beginning or end of the string. For example, \"my column \" becomes \"my column\" and \"column\" becomes \"column\". \n   \n```julia\ncol = \"MY COLUMN\"\nclean_col = strip(lower_col)\n```\n\n3. Now, we need to replace any spaces and hyphens in the string with underscores using Julia's `replace` function. This function takes two arguments: a pattern to search for and a replacement string. We can use the regular expression \"\\s\" to match whitespaces and \"-\" to match hyphens, and replace them with \"_\". For example, \"my column\" becomes \"my_column\" and \"column-abc\" becomes \"column_abc\". \n   \n```julia\ncol = \"MY COLUMN\"\nclean_col = replace(lower_col, \"\\s|-\", \"_\")\n```\n\n4. Finally, we can define the `clean_column` function that takes a column name as input and follows the steps above to clean it:\n   \n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    lower_col = lowercase(col)\n    clean_col = strip(lower_col)\n    cleaned_col = replace(clean_col, \"\\s|-\", \"_\")\n    return cleaned_col\nend\n```\n\nNow we can test our function with the provided input:\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Output: my_column\n```","status":200,"tokens":[200,472],"elapsed":21.078447958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
