Define the function `clean_column` that takes one input parameter, `col`.\n2. Use the built-in `lower()` function to convert the column name to lowercase. This ensures consistency in the naming convention and makes it easier to work with the data later on.\n3. Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces from the cleaned column name using the built-in `strip()` function. This makes the column name cleaner and more readable.\n4. Replace any spaces and hyphens in the column name with an underscore using the `replace()` function. This ensures that the column names are consistent and easy to use in other parts of the code.\n5. Return the cleaned column name as the output of the function.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the function:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = strip(col)\n    col = replace(col, \" \" => \"_\")\n    replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\nTo test the function with the provided input:\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\")  # Output: \"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[200,292],"elapsed":9.893020084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
