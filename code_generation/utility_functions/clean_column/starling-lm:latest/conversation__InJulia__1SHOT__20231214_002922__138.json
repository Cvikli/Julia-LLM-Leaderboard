Here is a function in Julia that does the cleaning you described:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(col) # Lowercase the column name\n    col = replace(col, r\"(\\s+|-)\" => \"_\") # Replace any leading or trailing whitespaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    return col # Return the cleaned column name\nend\n```\nHere's a breakdown of how the function works:\n\n* `lowercase(col)`: Converts the column name to lowercase.\n* `replace(col, r\"(\\s+|-)\" => \"_\"`: Replaces any leading or trailing whitespaces and hyphens with an underscore using the `replace` function. The regular expression pattern `r\"(\\s+|-)\"` matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, and line breaks) or a hyphen. The replacement string is simply `_`.\n* `return col`: Returns the cleaned column name.\n\nYou can call this function by passing in the name of the column you want to clean as an argument, like this:\n```\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.","status":200,"tokens":[79,289],"elapsed":9.718594917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
