[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the special instructions provided, here's how to write the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = strip(col) # Remove leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = lowercase(col) # Convert to lowercase\n    col = replace(col, r\"[- ]+(?= [A-Z])\" => \"_\") # Replace multiple spaces and hyphens with underscores before capital letters\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a single argument `col` of type `AbstractString`, which represents the column name. It then uses several built-in Julia functions to clean the column name:\n\n1. `strip(col)`: This removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the string.\n2. `lowercase(col)`: This converts all characters in the string to lowercase.\n3. `replace(col, r\"[- ]+(?= [A-Z])\" => \"_\")`: This regular expression pattern matches one or more consecutive spaces and hyphens, followed by a capital letter, and replaces them with an underscore. The lookahead assertion `(?= [A-Z])` ensures that this only happens before a capital letter to maintain the original camelCase or snake_case naming conventions.\n\nThe function returns the cleaned column name as its output.","status":200,"tokens":[382,316],"elapsed":14.601729792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
