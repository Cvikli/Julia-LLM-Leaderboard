Think through your approach step by step\n- I need to write a function named `clean_column`.\n- This function will take one parameter, which is the name of the column as a string.\n- I will lowercase the entire string to ensure uniformity.\n- I will strip any leading or trailing spaces to clean the column name.\n- Lastly, I will replace all spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n\n### 2. Write any functions and other code you need\nLet's write the required function based on the step-by-step approach outlined above.\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercasing the string\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Stripping leading and trailing spaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    \n    # Replacing spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, ' ' => '_', '-' => '_')\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\n\n### 3. Solve the task\nWe will now solve the given task with our `clean_column` function.\n\n```julia\n# Cleaning the provided column name\ncleaned_column = clean_column(\"My Column\")  # Expected: \"my_column\"\n```\n\n### 4. Check that your solution is correct\nThe expected result for the input \"My Column\" is \"my_column\". The function logic outlined above should meet this expectation, thus providing a correct solution to the task.","status":200,"tokens":[170,304],"elapsed":25.620053541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
