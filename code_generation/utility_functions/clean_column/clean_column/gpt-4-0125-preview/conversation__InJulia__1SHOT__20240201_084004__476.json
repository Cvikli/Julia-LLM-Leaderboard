This involves using Julia's string manipulation functions to:\n\n1. Lowercase the column name.\n2. Strip leading and trailing whitespaces.\n3. Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n\nHere is how you could write the `clean_column` function:\n\n```julia\n# Define the clean_column function\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s\\-]+\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n\n# Example usage\ncol_name = \" My Column-Name \"\nclean_name = clean_column(col_name)\nprintln(clean_name)  # Output: my_column_name\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `col` as input, applies the series of transformations, and returns the cleaned string. Note that the `replace` function uses a regular expression (`r\"[\\s\\-]+\"`) to match any space (`\\s`) or hyphen (`\\-`) characters and replace them with an underscore. The `+` in the regular expression indicates that the pattern should match one or more occurrences of the specified characters, ensuring that consecutive spaces or hyphens are also replaced with a single underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[72,302],"elapsed":19.754388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
