Here's how you could write the `clean_column` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `col` as input and performs the following steps:\n1. Convert the string to lowercase with `lowercase()`.\n2. Remove leading and trailing whitespace with `strip()`.\n3. Replace any sequence of spaces (`\\s`) or hyphens (`-`) with underscores (`_`). This is done using the `replace()` function along with a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]+\"`) to match spaces and hyphens. The `+` in the regex pattern indicates that one or more occurrences of the character set `[\\s-]` will be matched and replaced with `_`.\n\nYou can test the function with an example like so:\n\n```julia\nclean_col = clean_column(\"  My Column-Name \")\nprintln(clean_col)  # Output: \"my_column_name\"\n```\n\nThis should work as expected based on your specifications.","status":200,"tokens":[72,281],"elapsed":30.581849292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
