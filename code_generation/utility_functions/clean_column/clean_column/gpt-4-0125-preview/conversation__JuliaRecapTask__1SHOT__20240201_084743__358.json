[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that performs the desired operations for cleaning a column name:\n\n```julia\n\"\"\"\n`clean_column` cleans a given column name by performing the following operations:\n- Lowercasing the entire string\n- Stripping leading and trailing whitespaces\n- Replacing any spaces and hyphens with underscores\n\"\"\"\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)::AbstractString\n    # Lowercase the entire string\n    lowercased_col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    stripped_col = strip(lowercased_col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    clean_col = replace(stripped_col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return clean_col\nend\n```\n\nLet's double-check the correctness of the solution by applying it on a sample input:\n```julia\n# Sample column name\ncol = \"  My Column-Name \"\n\n# Clean the column name\ncleaned_col = clean_column(col)\n\nprintln(cleaned_col)  # Expected output: \"my_column_name\"\n```\n\nThis code defines the `clean_column` function according to the task's requirements and provides a way to test its functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[329,241],"elapsed":17.291281083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
