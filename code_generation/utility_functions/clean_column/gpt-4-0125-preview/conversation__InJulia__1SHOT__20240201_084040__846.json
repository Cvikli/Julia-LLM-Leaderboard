This function will take a string `col` as an input, and then it applies the transformations you specified: lowercasing the string, stripping leading and trailing whitespaces, and replacing spaces and hyphens with underscores. Here is how you can define this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    lowered = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    stripped = strip(lowered)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    cleaned = replace(stripped, r\"[\\s\\-]+\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return cleaned\nend\n```\n\nHere is a breakdown of the key parts of this function:\n\n- `lowercase(col)`: Converts all characters in the string to lowercase.\n- `strip(lowered)`: Removes any leading and trailing whitespaces from the string.\n- `replace(stripped, r\"[\\s\\-]+\" => \"_\")`: Replaces any sequence of spaces (`\\s`) or hyphens (`\\-`) with an underscore (`_`). The Regular Expression `[\\s\\-]+` is used to match one or more occurrences of spaces or hyphens.\n\nYou can test this function with an example like:\n\n```julia\nprintln(clean_column(\"   My Column-Name  \"))\n```\n\nThis should output `my_column_name` as per the specifications you provided.","status":200,"tokens":[72,303],"elapsed":36.193113291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
