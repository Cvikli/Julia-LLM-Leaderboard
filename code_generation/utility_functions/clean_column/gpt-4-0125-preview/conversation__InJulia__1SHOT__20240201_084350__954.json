Note that in the regular expression `[\\s\\-]+`, the square brackets `[]` define a character class that matches either a space or a hyphen, and the `+` ensures that one or more of these characters are matched and replaced together, avoiding consecutive underscores in the result.","status":200,"tokens":[72,349],"elapsed":23.224425958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
