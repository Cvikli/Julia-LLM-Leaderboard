Lowercase the entire string.\n2. Strip any leading or trailing whitespaces.\n3. Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n\nHere is how you could write the `clean_column` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return lowercase(replace(strip(col), r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\"))\nend\n\n# Example usage\ncleaned_col = clean_column(\" My Column-Name \")\nprintln(cleaned_col)  # Output: my_column_name\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n\n- `strip(col)` removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the column name.\n- `lowercase(...)` converts the column name to all lowercase letters.\n- `replace(..., r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")` replaces any sequence of spaces (denoted by `\\s` in the Regular Expression `r\"[\\s-]+\"`) or hyphens (`-`) with a single underscore (`_`). The `+` in the Regular Expression means \"one or more of the preceding element,\" which ensures that multiple consecutive spaces or hyphens are replaced by just a single underscore.\n\nRemember to replace `col::String` with `col` if you don't want to explicitly type-annotate the argument as a string, though it's good practice in Julia to specify the type where possible to exploit multiple dispatch and improve code clarity.","status":200,"tokens":[72,311],"elapsed":29.122821333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
