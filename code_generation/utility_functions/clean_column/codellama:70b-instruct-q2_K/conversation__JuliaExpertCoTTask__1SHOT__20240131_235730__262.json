I hope it meets your requirements!\n\n```julia-repl\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # lowercase and replace spaces with underscores\n    col = replace(lowercase(strip(col)), \" \" => \"_\")\n    # remove leading or trailing hyphens\n    col = strip(col, ['-'])\n    return col\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n\n* `clean_column` is a function that takes in one argument (`col`) which represents the column name. \n* I first convert the input string to lowercase using the `lowercase()` function.\n* Next, I strip any leading or trailing whitespaces from the string using the `strip()` function.\n* After that, I replace all spaces with underscores in the string using the `replace()` function. \n* Lastly, I remove leading and trailing hyphens (if they exist) using the `strip()` function.\n\nThe final return value is a cleaned column name. \n\nPlease let me know if this meets your requirements or if you have any further questions!","status":200,"tokens":[0,249],"elapsed":10.163219538,"_type":"aimessage"}]
