Write the function definition for `clean_column`. The function should take a single parameter `col` which is the column name to be cleaned. It should return a string containing the cleaned version of the input.\n2. Inside the function, use the `lowercase()` method to convert the input to lower case. You can also use the `strip()` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the input.\n3. Use the `replace` function with a regular expression (regex) pattern to replace spaces and hyphens in the cleaned string with underscores. The regex pattern should be `\"[\\\\s-]\"` and the replacement string is just `\"_\"` (a single underscore).\n4. Return the cleaned column name from the `clean_column` function.\n5. Outside of the function, use the `println()` method to print the output of calling `clean_column(\"My Column\")` and `clean_column(\"Another-Column\")`. These should demonstrate the function's functionality by producing a cleaned version of each input column name.\n\nHere is the completed Julia code:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Convert to lowercase, remove leading/trailing whitespaces, and replace spaces/hyphens with underscores using regex pattern [\\\\s-]\n    return replace(strip(lowercase(col)), r\"[\\\\s-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n\n# Test the function by printing cleaned versions of input column names\nprintln(\"Cleaned: \", clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Output: \"my_column\"\nprintln(\"Cleaned: \", clean_column(\"Another-Column\")) # Output: \"another_column\"\n```\nThis code defines a function `clean_column` that takes one parameter, `col`, which is the column name to be cleaned. The function returns a string with the cleaned version of the input. It performs several tasks to accomplish this: it converts the input to lowercase, removes leading and trailing whitespace, and replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores using regular expressions. Finally, it prints the output of calling `clean_column` on two sample inputs, demonstrating its functionality by producing a cleaned version of each input column name.","status":200,"tokens":[87,495],"elapsed":20.526594253,"_type":"aimessage"}]
