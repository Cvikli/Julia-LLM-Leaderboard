It first converts the column name to lowercase using the `lowercase` function. Then, it strips any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function. Finally, it replaces spaces and hyphens with an underscore using the `replace` function with a regular expression (`r\"[\\s-]\"`) that matches spaces and hyphens.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Clean \"My Column\" to get \"my_column\"\ncleaned_col = clean_column(\"My Column\")\nprintln(cleaned_col)  # Output: my_column\n```\n\nThis solution should meet your requirements.
