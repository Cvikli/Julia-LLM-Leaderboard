Input validation: Ensure that the input is a valid string.\n2. String processing: Convert the input to lowercase, strip leading and trailing whitespaces, and replace spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n3. Output: Return the cleaned column name as a string.\n\nHere's an implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia that follows the above approach:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)::String\n    # Input validation\n    if typeof(col) != String\n        error(\"Invalid input type: expected string\")\n    end\n    \n    # String processing\n    col = lowercase(col)  # Convert to lowercase\n    col = strip(col)      # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, \" \" => \"_\")  # Replace spaces with underscores\n    col = replace(col, \"-\" => \"_\")  # Replace hyphens with underscores\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\nNow you can test the function by passing in the string `\"My Column\"`:\n```julia\nclean_column(\"My Column\")  # Output: \"my_column\"\n```\nThe output is a cleaned column name as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":11.366375048,"_type":"aimessage"}]
