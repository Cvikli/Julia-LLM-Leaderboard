The `r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\"` part tells it to replace any whitespace or hyphen characters with underscores, while `lowercase` and `strip` are used to convert the column name into lowercase and remove leading/trailing whitespaces respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[194,168],"elapsed":9.562834209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
