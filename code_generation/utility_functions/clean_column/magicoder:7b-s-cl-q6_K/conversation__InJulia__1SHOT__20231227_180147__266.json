However, there is a slight problem that may arise if you have any other special characters in your column names that are not spaces or hyphens. In Julia, the `replace` function uses regular expressions to find and replace specific patterns of text. By using `[\\s-]` it will only find and replace spaces or hyphens. If there are other special characters you want to clean up as well, you need to add them inside the brackets.\n\nFor example, if you have a column name with dots like \"my.column\", this function won't work because it doesn't contain any spaces or hyphens. The solution is to use a more complex regular expression:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = lowercase(col)\n\n    # Replace any leading or trailing whitespaces with an empty string\n    col = replace(col, r\"^[ \\t]+|[ \\t]+$\", \"\")\n\n    # Replace spaces, hyphens and dots with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s-.]\", \"_\")\n\n    return col\nend\n```\nIn this version, the function will also remove any dots.","status":200,"tokens":[79,401],"elapsed":20.60716275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
