Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Lowercase the input string using `lower()` function.\n   - Strip leading and trailing whitespaces using `strip()` method.\n   - Replace spaces and hyphens with underscore using a regular expression in the format of \"\\s\" (space), \"-\" (hyphen) to match those characters and replace them with an underscore (\"_\").\n2.
