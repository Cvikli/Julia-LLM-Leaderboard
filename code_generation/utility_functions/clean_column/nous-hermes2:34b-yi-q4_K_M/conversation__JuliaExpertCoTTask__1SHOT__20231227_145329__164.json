Define a function `clean_column(col)` that takes a column name as input.\n2. Use string manipulation functions such as lowercase(), strip(), replace() from the DataFrames package to modify the column name.\n3. Return the cleaned column name.\n\n# Code\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    cleaned_col = lowercase(strip(replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\")))\n    return cleaned_col\nend\n\nclean_column(\"My Column\") # Output: \"my_column\"\n```\n\n# Verification\n\nThe function `clean_column` takes a column name and returns the cleaned version by following these steps:\n1. Convert the column name to lowercase using lowercase().\n2. Remove any leading or trailing whitespaces using strip().\n3. Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores in the column name using replace(col, r\"[ -]\" => \"_\"). The regular expression [ -] matches any space or hyphen character, which is replaced by an underscore (\"_\").\n4. Return the cleaned column name as output.","status":200,"tokens":[192,290],"elapsed":52.392981917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
