The `col` is first converted to lowercase using the `lowercase()` function.\n2. Any leading or trailing whitespaces are stripped from the lowercased column name with `replace(lowercased, r\"\\s|-|\" => \"_\")`. This uses regular expressions and replaces any spaces or hyphens with an underscore.\n3. Finally, a call to `return cleaned[1:end-1]` removes the last character from the string if it's an underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[117,199],"elapsed":35.463491667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
