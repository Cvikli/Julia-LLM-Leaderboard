Here's a simple Julia function to perform the cleaning steps you specified for the `col` argument as a column name:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = strip(col)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = replace(col, r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function in your Julia environment. Here's how you would use it:\n\n```julia\ncleaned_column = clean_column(\" My Column-Name \")\nprintln(cleaned_column)  # Output will be: \"my_column_name\"\n```\n\nThe function handles the case conversion, whitespace removal, and replacement of both hyphens and spaces with underscores. The `replace` function uses a regular expression pattern to match multiple occurrences of spaces and hyphens and replaces them with a single underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[72,202],"elapsed":11.507221375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
