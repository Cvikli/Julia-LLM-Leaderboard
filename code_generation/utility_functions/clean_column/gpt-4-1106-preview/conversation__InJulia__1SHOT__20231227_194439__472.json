You can write a function in Julia to perform this cleaning task on the column names as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    cleaned_col = lowercase(col)          # Lowercase the entire string\n    cleaned_col = strip(cleaned_col)      # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    cleaned_col = replace(cleaned_col, r\"[ -]+\" => \"_\")  # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    return cleaned_col\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ncol_name = \" My Column-Name \"\ncleaned_name = clean_column(col_name)\nprintln(cleaned_name) # Should print \"my_column_name\"\n```\n\nThis function first converts the entire `col` string to lowercase, then strips any spaces from both ends. It uses a regular expression in the `replace` function to find all occurrences of spaces and hyphens (one or more times, indicated by `+`) and replaces them with underscores. The function returns the cleaned column name.","status":200,"tokens":[72,203],"elapsed":14.146800583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
