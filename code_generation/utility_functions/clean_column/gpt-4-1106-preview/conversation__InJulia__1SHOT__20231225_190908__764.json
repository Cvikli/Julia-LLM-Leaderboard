Here is a function `clean_column` written in Julia that will clean up column names according to the rules you specified:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return lowercase(replace(col, r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")) |> strip\nend\n```\n\nThe function `clean_column` takes a string `col` as its argument, applies several string operations and returns the cleaned column name. Here's a breakdown of what each function does:\n\n- `lowercase(col)`: Converts all characters in the string `col` to lowercase.\n- `replace(col, r\"[\\s-]+\" => \"_\")`: Replaces all groups of spaces (`\\s`) and hyphens (`-`) in the `col` with underscores (`_`).\n- `strip`: Removes any leading or trailing whitespaces from the resulting string after the `replace` function has been applied.\n\nPutting it all together, any input string will be transformed through these steps, and the resulting string will be in a cleaned, consistent format.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ncol_name = \" My Column-Name \"\ncleaned_col_name = clean_column(col_name)\nprintln(cleaned_col_name) # Output should be \"my_column_name\"\n```\n\nAs you can see from the example, when you call `clean_column` with a column name, it will return the cleaned version.","status":200,"tokens":[72,291],"elapsed":13.603247125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
