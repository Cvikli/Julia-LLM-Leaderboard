Below is a Python function that performs the cleaning operations on a column name as you described:\n\n```python\ndef clean_column(col):\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = col.lower()\n    # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = col.strip()\n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    col = col.replace(\" \", \"_\").replace(\"-\", \"_\")\n    return col\n\n# Example usage:\ncolumn_name = \" My Column-Name \"\ncleaned_column_name = clean_column(column_name)\nprint(cleaned_column_name)  # Output: my_column_name\n```\n\nThis function takes a string `col` as input, applies the cleaning steps, and returns the cleaned column name. You can test the function with different column names to ensure it works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[69,163],"elapsed":12.87856875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
