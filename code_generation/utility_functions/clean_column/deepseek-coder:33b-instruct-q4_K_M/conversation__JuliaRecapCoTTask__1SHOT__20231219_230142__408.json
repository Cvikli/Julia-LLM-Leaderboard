[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, thank you for providing the task and special instructions! Based on the given guidelines and instructions, I will approach this problem systematically as a world-class Julia language programmer. Here are my steps to solve the task:\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets (5 minutes)\n\nI will quickly review the Julia syntax and features that might be helpful for this task, such as variable declarations, control structures, functions, arrays, slicing, tuples, dictionaries, and string interpolation. I will also keep in mind the reserved names and any special instructions provided.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task (30 minutes)\n\nUsing the recalled syntax and features, I will write a function `clean_column` that meets the requirements specified in the task. Here is the solution:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = replace(col, r\"\\s+\", \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-check the solution (5 minutes)\n\nTo ensure that the solution is correct, I will test it with a few examples and check if the output matches what was expected. Here are some sample inputs and outputs to test the function:\n\n| Input | Output |\n| --- | --- |\n| \"My Column\" | \"my_column\" |\n| \"Hello   World\" | \"hello_world\" |\n| \"-My-Column-\" | \"-my_column_\" |\n\nIf any of these outputs are incorrect, I will modify the function accordingly.\n\nStep 4: Implement Special Instructions (if any) (10 minutes)\n\nIf there are any special instructions provided, I will prioritize them over the general guidelines and approach the task accordingly. For example, if the instruction is to use a specific package or feature that is not mentioned in the guidelines, I will make sure to include it in my solution.\n\nTotal Time: 60 minutes\n\nI hope this systematic approach helps me solve the task efficiently while ensuring the output meets your expectations!","status":200,"tokens":[1,464],"elapsed":16.729782292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
