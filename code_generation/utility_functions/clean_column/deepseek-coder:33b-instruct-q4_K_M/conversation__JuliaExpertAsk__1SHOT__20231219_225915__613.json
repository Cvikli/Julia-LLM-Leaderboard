Here is a possible implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(col) # lowercase the column name\n    col = replace(col, r\"\\s+\", \"_\") # strip leading and trailing spaces\n    col = replace(col, r\"-\", \"_\") # replace hyphens with underscores\n    return col # return the cleaned column name\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `lowercase`, `replace`, and `rfind` functions from the standard library to perform the desired transformations on the input column name. The `r\"\\s+\"` pattern matches one or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, line breaks, etc.), and the `replace` function replaces them with an underscore. Similarly, the `r\"-\"` pattern matches a hyphen, and the `replace` function replaces it with an underscore.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input column name is a string. If the input is a symbol or any other type of data, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,240],"elapsed":7.621562375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
