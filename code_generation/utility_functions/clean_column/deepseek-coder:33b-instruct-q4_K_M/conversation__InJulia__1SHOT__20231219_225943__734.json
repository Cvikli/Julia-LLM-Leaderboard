Here is an example of how you could implement the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(col) # Lowercase the column name\n    col = trim(col) # Strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, \" \\\\([-] \\\\)\" => \"_\") # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    return col # Return the cleaned column name\nend\n```\nHere's a breakdown of how each line contributes to the overall function:\n\n* `lowercase(col)`: Converts the input column name to lowercase. This is necessary because Julia's string manipulation functions (like `trim`) operate on uppercase strings by default, and we want our cleaned column names to be in lowercase.\n* `trim(col)`: Strips leading and trailing whitespaces from the column name using the `trim` function. This is necessary because we don't want any unnecessary whitespace characters in our cleaned column names.\n* `replace(col, \" \\\\([-] \\\\)\" => \"_\")`: Replaces any spaces and hyphens (`-`) in the column name with an underscore (`_`). This is necessary because we want to replace these special characters with something more generic and less likely to cause issues when working with the cleaned column names.\n* `return col`: Returns the cleaned column name at the end of the function.\n\nWith this function, you can pass in a column name as an argument (`\"My Column\"`), and it will return the cleaned column name (`\"my_column\"`).","status":200,"tokens":[1,363],"elapsed":11.644837958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
