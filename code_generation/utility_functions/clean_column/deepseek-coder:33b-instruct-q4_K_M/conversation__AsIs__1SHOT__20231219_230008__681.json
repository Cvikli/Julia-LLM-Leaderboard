Here is a function `clean_column` that does what you described:\n```\ndef clean_column(col):\n    return col.lower().strip().replace(\" \",\"_\").replace(\"-\",\"_\")\n```\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The function starts with the argument `col`, which is the column name to be cleaned.\n2. We use the `lower()` method to convert the column name to lowercase. This is important because some databases may treat uppercase and lowercase names differently.\n3. Next, we use the `strip()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the column name. This ensures that the cleaned column name does not have any unnecessary spaces.\n4. Finally, we replace any occurrences of spaces and hyphens in the column name with an underscore using the `replace()` method. This is done to make the column name more readable and consistent.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function can be used:\n```\nprint(clean_column(\"My Column\")) # Output: \"my_column\"\nprint(clean_column(\"My   Column\")) # Output: \"my_column\"\nprint(clean_column(\"My-Column\")) # Output: \"my_column\"\n```\nI hope this helps!
