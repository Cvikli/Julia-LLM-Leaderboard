X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, let's get started! Based on the problem statement and special instructions provided, here are the steps I will follow to solve this task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Lowercasing a string: `string.lowercase()`\n\t* Stripping leading/trailing spaces: `string.replace(r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\", \"\")`\n\t* Replacing spaces and hyphens with an underscore: `string.gsub(\" [^_] \", \"_\")`\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Write a function `clean_column(col)` that takes a string column name as input\n\t* Lowercase the input string using `string.lowercase()`\n\t* Strip leading and trailing spaces using `string.replace(r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\", \"\")`\n\t* Replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore using `string.gsub(\" [^_] \", \"_\")`\n\t* Return the cleaned column name\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with some sample input values, such as \"My Column\", \"my column\", \" MY COLUMN \", and \" MY_COLUMN \"\n\t* Verify that the output is correct, i.e., \"my_column\" for all inputs\n\nHere's the implemented `clean_column` function:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the input string\n    col = col.lowercase()\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing spaces\n    col = col.replace(r\"^\\s+|\\s+$\", \"\")\n    \n    # Replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore\n    col = col.gsub(\" [^_] \", \"_\")\n    \n    return col\nend\n```\nNote that I've used `AbstractString` as the input type to make the function more flexible and able to handle different types of strings. Also, I've avoided using any new packages unless explicitly requested.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!","status":200,"tokens":[1,475],"elapsed":17.154483708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
