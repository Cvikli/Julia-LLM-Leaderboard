In this case, we use it to convert the column name to lowercase.\n2. `strip`: This function removes any leading or trailing whitespace from a string. We use it to remove any spaces before or after the column name.\n3. `replace`: This function replaces all occurrences of a pattern with another string. In this case, we replace any space or hyphen with an underscore. The `r\"\\s+\"` regex matches one or more whitespace characters (spaces and tabs).\n4. `return`: We return the cleaned column name as a result of the function.\n\nTesting:\n```julia\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[202,220],"elapsed":23.476104416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
