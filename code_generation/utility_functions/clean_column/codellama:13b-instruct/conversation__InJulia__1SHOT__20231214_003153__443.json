Here is a function in Julia that does the cleaning you described:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the column name\n    col = tolower(col)\n    \n    # Strip leading and trailing spaces\n    col = replace(col, \" \"^ )\n    col = replace(col, \"\\n\" )\n    \n    # Replace any hyphens with an underscore\n    col = replace(col, \"-\")\n    return col\nend\n```\nHere's a breakdown of the function:\n\n* `tolower()` converts the column name to lowercase.\n* `replace()` is used to strip leading and trailing spaces from the column name. The regular expression `\" \"^` matches any single space at the beginning or end of the string, and the replacement string is an empty string, which effectively removes the space. Similarly, the regular expression `\\n` matches any new line character, and the replacement string is also an empty string, which effectively removes the newline.\n* `replace()` is used again to replace any hyphens in the column name with an underscore. The regular expression `\"-\"` matches any hyphen, and the replacement string is an underscore, which effectively replaces the hyphen with an underscore.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with the name of the column you want to clean as an argument, like so: `clean_column(\"My Column\")`. This will return the cleaned column name, which in this case is `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[79,332],"elapsed":11.191398084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
