Here is a possible implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = substitute(col, r\"(\\s+|-)\\s*\", \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `lowercase` function is used to convert the column name to lowercase.\n* The `substitute` function is used to replace any leading or trailing whitespaces and hyphens with an underscore. The regular expression pattern `(\\s+|-)\\s*` matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, and line breaks) followed by one or more whitespace characters, and replaces it with an underscore.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the column name is a string. If the input is a symbol or a number, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,197],"elapsed":6.216790833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
