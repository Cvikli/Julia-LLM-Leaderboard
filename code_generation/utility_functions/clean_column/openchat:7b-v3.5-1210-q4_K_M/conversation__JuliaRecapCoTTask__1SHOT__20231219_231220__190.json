[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! I'm ready to help you solve the problem. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\nI will recall the following useful Julia snippets for this task:\n\t* Lowercasing a string: `string = lowercase(col)`\n\t* Stripping leading and trailing whitespaces: `col = remove(col, start=true, end=true)`\n\t* Replacing spaces and hyphens with an underscore: `col = replace(col, \" \") -> \"_\"`\n2. Solve the task:\nI will use the above snippets to write a function `clean_column` that takes a string `col` as input and returns its cleaned version. Here is the implementation:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = remove(col, start=true, end=true)\n    col = replace(col, \" \") -> \"_\"\n    return col\nend\n```\n3. Double-check the solution:\nI will double-check the solution by testing it with a few examples and checking that the output is correct.\n\nHere are some example inputs and outputs to test the function:\n\n* Input: \"My Column\"\n\t+ Output: \"my_column\"\n* Input: \"   My Column  \"\n\t+ Output: \"my_column\"\n* Input: \"My-Column\"\n\t+ Output: \"my_column\"\n\nIf the above examples pass, I will consider the function to be correct.\n\nPlease provide any additional instructions or modifications to the function as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[1,360],"elapsed":12.775000625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
