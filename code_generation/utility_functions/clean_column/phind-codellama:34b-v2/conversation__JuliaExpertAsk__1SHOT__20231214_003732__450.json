Here is a possible implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = trim(col, whitespace())\n    col = replace(col, \" [^_]\") {\"_\"}\n    return col\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `lowercase(col)` converts the column name to lowercase.\n* `trim(col, whitespace()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the column name.\n* `replace(col, \" [^_]\")` replaces any non-underscore characters with an underscore, so that the output is a valid identifier. The `[^_]` pattern matches any character that is not an underscore.\n\nNote: In Julia, `AbstractString` is a type alias for any string type, including character arrays and buffers. `lowercase`, `trim`, and `replace` are built-in functions in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[108,217],"elapsed":7.687990917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
