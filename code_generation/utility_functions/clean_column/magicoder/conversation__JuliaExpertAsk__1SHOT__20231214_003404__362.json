Here is the function you requested:\n```julia\nclean_column(col) = lowercase(sub(r\"\\s+\", \"_\", col))\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `lowercase` converts the column name to lowercase.\n* `sub` is a function that replaces a pattern (in this case, any sequence of one or more whitespace characters) with a replacement string. The pattern is specified using regular expressions (`r`), and the replacement string is specified as a string literal (\"_\").\n\nFor example, if we call the function like this:\n```julia\n> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\nIt will return the cleaned-up column name.","status":200,"tokens":[108,162],"elapsed":5.8998115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
