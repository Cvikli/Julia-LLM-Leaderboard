Here is a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[\\s-]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by first calling `lowercase` to convert the string to lower case, then `strip` to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces. The `replace` function is used with a regex pattern that matches either whitespace (`\\s`) or hyphen (`-`), and replaces them with underscore (`_`).","status":200,"tokens":[118,129],"elapsed":4.308584083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
