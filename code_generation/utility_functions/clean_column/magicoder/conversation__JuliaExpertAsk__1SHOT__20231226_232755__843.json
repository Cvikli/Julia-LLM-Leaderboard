Here is a function `clean_column` that does the job:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # lowercase, strip whitespace from both ends and replace spaces and hyphens with underscore\n    return replace(lowercase(strip(col)), r\"[- _]\" => \"_\")\nend\n```\nThe function `clean_column` firstly converts all characters to their lower case equivalents using the `lowercase` function. Then, it removes any leading or trailing whitespaces using the `strip` function and finally replaces any spaces or hyphens with underscores. The `replace` method is used with a regular expression `r\"[- _]\"` that matches either space or hyphen characters (as well as underscore) with an underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[118,189],"elapsed":6.079795333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
