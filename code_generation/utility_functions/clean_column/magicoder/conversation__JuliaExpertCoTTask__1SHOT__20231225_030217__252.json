Next it replaces all spaces and hyphens with underscores using the `replace()` method. This function can be easily translated into Julia as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    return lowercase(strip(col)) |> replace(\" \", \"_\") |> replace(\"-\", \"_\")\nend\n\nprintln(clean_column(\"My Column\"))  # my_column\n```\nThis Julia function uses the built-in `lowercase` and `replace` functions to achieve the same result as its Python counterpart.","status":200,"tokens":[194,209],"elapsed":7.129679,"_type":"aimessage"}]
