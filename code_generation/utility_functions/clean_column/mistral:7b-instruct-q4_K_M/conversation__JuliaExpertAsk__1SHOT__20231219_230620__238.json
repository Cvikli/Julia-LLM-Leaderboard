Here is a possible implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col)\n    col = lowercase(col) # lowercase the column name\n    col = trim(col) # remove leading and trailing spaces\n    col = replace(col, \" \\\\* \".++) # replace any spaces or hyphens with an underscore\n    return col # return the cleaned column name\nend\n```\nNote that in Julia, we use the `lowercase` function to convert the column name to lowercase, and the `trim` function to remove leading and trailing spaces. The `replace` function is used to replace any occurrences of the spaces or hyphens with an underscore.","status":200,"tokens":[1,158],"elapsed":4.959884417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
