Here is a possible implementation of the `clean_column` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(col) # lowercase the column name\n    col = trim(col) # strip leading and trailing whitespaces\n    col = replace(col, \" \\\\\" => \"_\") # replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    return col # return the cleaned-up column name\nend\n```\nNote that `trim` is a built-in function in Julia that removes leading and trailing whitespaces from a string. The `replace` function replaces a pattern (in this case, spaces and hyphens) with a replacement string (an underscore).","status":200,"tokens":[1,158],"elapsed":4.966739708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
