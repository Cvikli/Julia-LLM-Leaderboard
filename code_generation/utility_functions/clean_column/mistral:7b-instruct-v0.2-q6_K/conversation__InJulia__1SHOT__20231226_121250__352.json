The function accepts a single argument `col` which is an abstract string.\n2. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from the string.\n3. The `lowercase` function converts the entire string to lowercase letters.\n4. The regular expression `r\"[-\\s]+\"`, with the `replace` function, is used to replace any sequences of spaces and hyphens with a single underscore.\n5. Finally, the cleaned column name is returned as output.","status":200,"tokens":[74,251],"elapsed":13.976712333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
