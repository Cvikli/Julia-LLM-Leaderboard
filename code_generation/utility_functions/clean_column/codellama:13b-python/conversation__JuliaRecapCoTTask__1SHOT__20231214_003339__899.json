X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started on the task of creating a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name.\n\nStep 1 - Recall Julia Snippets (5 minutes)\n\n* Review the Julia language syntax and key features such as variables, control structures, functions, arrays, slicing, tuples, namedtuples, dictionaries, and reserved names.\n* Identify any relevant snippets from the Julia standard library or user-defined code that can be reused in the function `clean_column`.\n\nStep 2 - Solve the Task (30 minutes)\n\n* Using the recalled syntax and features, create a function `clean_column` that takes a column name as input (`col`) and returns its cleaned version.\n* Implement the logic to lowercase the column name, strip any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replace any spaces and hyphens with an underscore.\n* Test the function with various inputs to ensure it works correctly.\n\nStep 3 - Double-check Solution (10 minutes)\n\n* Review the implemented code line by line to ensure it is correct and follows the guidelines provided.\n* Check that the function properly lowers case, removes leading/trailing whitespace, and replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores.\n\nSpecial Instructions:\n\n{{instructions}}\n\nIf you have any special instructions, please provide them now and I will prioritize them over the above guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[11,322],"elapsed":11.6173625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
