[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::String)\n    # Apply the desired transformations to `col`\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = strip(col)\n    col = replace(col, \" \", \"_\")\n    col = replace(col, \"-\", \"_\")\n    return col\nend\n```\nLet's go through each step of the problem-solving process:\n\n1. **Recall Julia snippets**: We recall the `lowercase` function to lowercase a string and the `strip` function to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from a string. We also recall the `replace` function to replace all occurrences of a given pattern in a string with another string.\n2. **Solve the Task**: Based on the problem statement, we define a function called `clean_column` that takes a column name as an input and applies the desired transformations to clean it up. We use the `lowercase`, `strip`, and `replace` functions to achieve this.\n3. **Double-check that the solution is correct**: To ensure that our solution is correct, we test it with some sample inputs. For example, if we call `clean_column(\"My Column\")`, we expect it to return `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,277],"elapsed":3.773518685,"_type":"aimessage"}]
