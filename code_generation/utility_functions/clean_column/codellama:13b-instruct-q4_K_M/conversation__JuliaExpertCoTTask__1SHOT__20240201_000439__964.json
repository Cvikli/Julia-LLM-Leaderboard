Think through your approach step by step:\n\t* Lowercase the column name using `lowercase`\n\t* Strip leading and trailing whitespaces using `strip`\n\t* Replace any spaces or hyphens with an underscore using `replace` with a regular expression (`r\"\\s+|-\"`) that matches one or more whitespace characters or a hyphen, and replaces them with an underscore.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\t* The function `clean_column` takes a single argument of type `String` and returns a new string that is the cleaned column name.\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Call the `clean_column` function with the input string \"My Column\" to get the desired output \"my_column\".\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\t* Run the code and check that it produces the expected output for various inputs, including \"My Column\", \"Another Column\", and \"Column-with-hyphens\".","status":200,"tokens":[0,327],"elapsed":4.424322784,"_type":"aimessage"}]
