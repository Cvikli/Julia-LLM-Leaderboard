Here is a function `clean_column` that does what you described:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    col = lowercase(col)\n    col = trim(col, startswith = true, endswith = true)\n    return replace(col, \" \", \"_\")\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `lowercase(col)` converts the column name to lowercase.\n* `trim(col, startswith = true, endswith = true)` removes any leading and trailing spaces from the column name.\n* `replace(col, \" \", \"_\")` replaces any spaces in the column name with an underscore.\n\nYou can call this function by passing in the column name as an argument, like this: `clean_column(\"My Column\")`. The resulting cleaned-up column name will be `\"my_column\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[108,196],"elapsed":6.948678542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
