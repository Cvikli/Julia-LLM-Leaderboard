Here is a function for cleaning a column name in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    return lowercase(trim(replace(col, \" \\\\\", \"_\")));\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `lowercase` converts the input string to lowercase.\n* `trim` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string.\n* `replace` replaces any occurrences of \" \\\\\" (backslash-spaces) with an underscore.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input string is a valid column name, and may not work correctly for all inputs. If you need to handle more complex transformations or edge cases, you may want to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,164],"elapsed":5.155849167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
