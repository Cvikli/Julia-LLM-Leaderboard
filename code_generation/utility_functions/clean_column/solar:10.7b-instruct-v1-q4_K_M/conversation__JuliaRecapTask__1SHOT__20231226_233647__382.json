[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Step 1: Recall useful Julia snippets - lowercase, replace, strip\n    \n    # Step 2: Solve the Task\n    cleaned_name = strip(replace(lowercase(col), r\"\\s+\", \"_\"))\n    return cleaned_name\nend\n```\n\nThis function `clean_column()` takes in a string as an argument (representing the column name). It uses several Julia functions to clean and transform the column name:\n\n- `lowercase(col)` is used to convert the entire column name to lower case.\n- `strip(x)` removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string `x`.\n- `replace(str, pat, rep)` replaces all occurrences of pattern `pat` with replacement `rep` in `str`. In this case, it replaces one or more whitespaces \"\\\\s+\" with an underscore \"_\".\n\nThe cleaned column name is then returned by the function.","status":200,"tokens":[389,231],"elapsed":16.721955583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
