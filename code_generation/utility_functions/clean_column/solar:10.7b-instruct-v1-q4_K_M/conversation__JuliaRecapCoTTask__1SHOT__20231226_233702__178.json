[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `clean_column` that cleans a column name (`col`) by lowercasing it, stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, and replacing any spaces and hyphens with an underscore, eg, \"My Column\" becomes \"my_column\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Assuming there are no special instructions provided, here is the Julia function to clean a column name according to the given requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction clean_column(col::AbstractString)\n    # Lowercase the string\n    cleaned_str = lowercase(col)\n    \n    # Remove leading and trailing whitespaces\n    cleaned_str = strip(cleaned_str)\n    \n    # Replace spaces and hyphens with underscores\n    cleaned_str = replace(cleaned_str, r\"[ -]+\", \"_\")\n    \n    return cleaned_str\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in an `AbstractString`, performs the requested operations, and returns the cleaned version of the column name. Note that Julia standard libraries are used (no additional packages) and type annotations provide enough flexibility for various input types while preserving readability and performance.","status":200,"tokens":[391,191],"elapsed":14.367354459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
