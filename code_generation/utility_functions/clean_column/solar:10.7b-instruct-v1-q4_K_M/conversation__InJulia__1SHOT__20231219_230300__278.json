This is useful because some columns may have leading or trailing caps that you want to remove.\n2. `trim(col)`: The `trim` function removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the column name. This is useful because some columns may have unnecessary whitespace at the beginning or end of the name.\n3. `replace(col, \" \\\\+ \".split())`: The `replace` function replaces any occurrences of the pattern \" \\\\+\" with an underscore. The `split()` function splits the pattern into individual characters, and then the `replace()` function replaces each character with an underscore. This is useful because some columns may have spaces or hyphens in their names that you want to replace with an underscore.\n4. `return col`: The function returns the cleaned column name after applying all of the transformations.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with the name of the column you want to clean, like this:\n```\njulia> clean_column(\"My Column\")\n\"my_column\"\n```\nI hope this helps!
