We can use the built-in `startswith` function to check if a word starts with a capital letter. Here's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(first(word)))\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis will give us the following output:\n\n```julia\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[204,208],"elapsed":7.196312167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
