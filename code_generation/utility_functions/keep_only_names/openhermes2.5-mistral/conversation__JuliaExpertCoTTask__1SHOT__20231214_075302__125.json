Let's get started.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n\t* Identify the criteria for a word to be kept in the list (i.e., it must start with a capital letter).\n\t* Think about how to iterate over the list of words and check each one against the criterion.\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\t* Create a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with only the words that start with capital letters.\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Implement the function using a for loop to iterate over the list of words, and a conditional statement to check if the first letter of each word is a capital letter. If it is, then the word is kept in the list, otherwise it is removed.\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with some example input (provided in the task) and make sure it produces the expected output.\n\nHere is the implemented function `keep_only_names`:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractString[])\n    new_list = []\n    for word in words\n        if first(word) == uppercasefirst(word)\n            push!(new_list, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_list\nend\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[188,331],"elapsed":12.407316917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
