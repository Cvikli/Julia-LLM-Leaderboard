It does this by iterating over each word in the provided list and checking if its first character is between 'A' and 'Z'. If it is, the word is added to a new list of filtered words. The function then returns this list of filtered words.","status":200,"tokens":[73,279],"elapsed":8.737975291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
