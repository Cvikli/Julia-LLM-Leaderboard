[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started on the task at hand. Based on the provided instructions and guidelines, here are the steps I will follow to solve the problem:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `lowercase` function for converting strings to lowercase\n\t* `startswith` function for checking if a string starts with a certain prefix\n\t* `filter` function for filtering out unwanted elements in a list\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Create a function `keep_only_names(words::AbstractString)` that takes a list of words as input and returns a new list with only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\t* Use the `lowercase` function to convert the input list to lowercase\n\t* Use the `startswith` function to filter out the words that do not start with a capital letter\n\t* Use the `filter` function to create a new list with only the filtered words\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with a few input cases, such as [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Capital\"]\n\t* Verify that the output list contains only the words that start with capital letters\n\nHere's the implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\n# Function to keep only names that start with a capital letter\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractString)\n    # Convert input list to lowercase\n    words = lowercase(words)\n    \n    # Filter out words that do not start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> startswith(word, 'Capital'), words)\n    \n    # Return the filtered list of words\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on the solution!","status":200,"tokens":[11,405],"elapsed":14.665617417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
