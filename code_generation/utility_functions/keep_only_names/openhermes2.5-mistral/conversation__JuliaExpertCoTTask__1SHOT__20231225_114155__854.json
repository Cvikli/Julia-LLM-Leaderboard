Iterate over each word in the provided list of words (`words`).\n2. Check if the first character of the word is a capital letter.\n3. If it's a capital letter, keep the word; otherwise, discard it.\n4. Collect all the kept words in a new list.\n5. Return the final list of only capitalized words.\n\nHere's the Julia code implementing these steps:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{<:AbstractString})\n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list of words.\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is a capital letter.\n        if uppercase(first(word)) == first(word)\n            push!(result, word)  # If it's a capital letter, keep the word; otherwise, discard it.\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nNow we can use this function for our provided example:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nThis will output `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[204,288],"elapsed":15.04083175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
