Here is an example of how you could write a function in Julia to remove words from a list that do not start with a capital letter:\n```\n# Load the WordPress module for convenience\nusing WordPress\n\n# Define the function to keep only names that start with a capital letter\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Create an empty list to store the kept words\n    kept_words = Vector{String}()\n    \n    # Iterate over the provided list of words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if first(word) >= 'A' && first(word) <= 'Z'\n            # Add the word to the kept list\n            pushed keep_only_names(word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the kept words\n    return kept_words\nend\n```\nTo use this function, you can call it with a list of strings as an argument, like this:\n```\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Fido\", \"Capital\"]\nkept_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(\"Kept names:\")\nprintln(kept_names) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Fido\", \"Capital\"]\n```\nThis function uses the `first` function to check if the first character of each word is a capital letter. If it is, the word is added to the kept list using the `pushed` function from the WordPress module. The `return` statement at the end of the function returns the kept words as a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[69,359],"elapsed":12.056898166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
