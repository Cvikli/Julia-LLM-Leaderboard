Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nkeep_only_names(words) = filter(word -> startswith(word, capitalize(word)), words)\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `filter` is a built-in function in Julia that allows us to create a new list by applying a function to each element of the input list.\n* `startswith` is a built-in function in Julia that checks if a string starts with a given substring.\n* `capitalize` is a built-in function in Julia that capitalizes the first letter of a string.\n\nBy using `filter` and `startswith`, we can create a new list that only contains words that start with a capital letter. The `startswith` function checks if the first character of each word in the input list is a capital letter, and if it is, the word is included in the output list.\n\nFor example, if we call `keep_only_names` with the list `[ \"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Capitalize\" ]`, it will return the list `[ \"Dog\", \"Capitalize\" ]`.","status":200,"tokens":[98,258],"elapsed":8.984797667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
