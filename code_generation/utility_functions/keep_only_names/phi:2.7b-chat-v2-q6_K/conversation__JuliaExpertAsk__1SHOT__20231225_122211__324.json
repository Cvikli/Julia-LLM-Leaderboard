For this particular task, you have three types of images: dogs, cats, and birds. You have written a function `keep_only_names` that filters out words from a list based on whether they start with a capital letter or not. \n\nThe function works fine for your English language dataset but it's not working as expected for the Julia language dataset because it doesn't recognize the difference between an initial capital and lowercase letter in the first word of each image name when written in all-lower case. \n\nYou have a list `img_names` which is a collection of strings representing the names of images in your project, but some of these names are not correctly formatted for the Julia language due to this issue:\n\n```python\nimg_names = ['Dog', 'cat', 'Bird', 'dog', 'bird']\n```\n\nYour task is to write a new function `correct_image_names(img_names)` that corrects these image names by converting them to all lower case and then uses the `keep_only_names` function to filter out any words in these images' names that don't start with a capital letter.\n\nQuestion: How would you write the `correct_image_names(img_names)` function?\n\n\nThe first step is to convert all the image names from uppercase or lowercase to all lower case, which can be done using the `toLowerCase()` function in Julia. \n```python\nlowercase_img_names = map(words => words[0].toLowerCase(), img_names)\n```\nThis code transforms the list of image names into a new list where each name is converted to all lower case, but only the first letter of each word remains capitalized. \n\nNext, you need to filter out any strings in `lowercase_img_names` that don't start with a capital letter using the `keep_only_names` function from your previous question. Remember to use the `filter()` and `map()` functions together here for more efficiency. \n```python\ncorrected_img_names = filter(keep_only_names, map(words => words[0], lowercase_img_names))\n```\nThis code first applies the `map()` function to convert each image name into a list containing its first letter, then uses the `filter()` function to keep only those names that start with a capital letter.\n\nAnswer: The `correct_image_names(img_names)` function would look like this: \n```python\nfunction correct_image_names(img_names) {\nlowercase_img_names = map(words => words[0].toLowerCase(), img_names)\nreturn filter(keep_only_names, map(words => words[0], lowercase_img_names))\n}\n```","status":200,"tokens":[102,681],"elapsed":18.138032416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
