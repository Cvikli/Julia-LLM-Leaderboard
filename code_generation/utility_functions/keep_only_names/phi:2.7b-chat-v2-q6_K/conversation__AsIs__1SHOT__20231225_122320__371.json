It does this by iterating over each word in the original list, checking if its first character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method, and appending it to a new list if it is. Finally, it returns the new list of capitalized words.\n\n\nImagine you are an agricultural scientist studying different types of plants and their names. You have recently been given a database that contains all the names of different plant species in the English language. However, this database has been corrupted by a sneaky hacker and some entries don't seem to make sense.\n\nHere's what we know from the database:\n1) All plant names are written as two words: a common word followed by an uncommon word. The unusual word starts with a capital letter (ex: 'Rose', 'Apple Tree') \n2) None of these names follow this pattern except for one - \"Dog\". However, it's not clear whether it's a valid name or not.\n3) You also noticed that the database contains only one other word which does not start with a capital letter and is related to plants: 'dog'.\n\nQuestion: Based on your knowledge of our conversation above about identifying words starting with a capital letter, can you determine if \"Dog\" is indeed an acceptable name for a plant species?\n\n\nFirst, we recall the fact from our conversation that a valid word in this context must start with a capital letter. This means that the first character of \"Dog\" should be a capital letter 'D'. However, upon inspecting it, we see that the first character is indeed lower case. Thus, using deductive logic, \"Dog\" cannot be a plant name based on our initial condition.\n\nNext, let's consider the second part of our puzzle. We know from the conversation that in the context of plants and names, 'dog' can also be a word as long as it is followed by another capital letter-starting word to form a proper noun. However, upon inspecting the data again, we find no such word following 'Dog'. Hence, even if we ignore our initial condition from step 1 for this particular test case (proof by contradiction), it still doesn't change the fact that \"Dog\" does not seem to follow the valid naming rule in this context.\nAnswer: No, based on both direct proof and proof by contradiction, \"Dog\" is not an acceptable name for a plant species.","status":200,"tokens":[62,621],"elapsed":16.161688833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
