The challenge is that this time, you can only use methods provided by the Julia language itself without any external libraries or APIs. \n\nHere are some additional rules:\n1. You should minimize the number of method calls in your solution. \n2. Your code must be readable and easy to understand for future developers. \n3. Your solution must handle cases where the list `words` is empty, contains only non-alphabetic words, or all words start with capital letters. \n4. You are not allowed to use any built-in functions that check if a word starts with a capital letter (like `start_with?`) in your solution.\n\nQuestion: What would be your optimized algorithm for this task and how many method calls would it make given an input list of words `words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bear\"]`?\n\n\nStart by defining a function to check if a string is all uppercase (`is_all_caps`). This function can be defined without using any built-in functions and would only have two method calls: `length` and `each`.\n```python\nfunction is_all_caps(s)\n    length(s) == 1 && all?(c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z' for c in s);\nend\n```\n\nNext, define a function to filter out the words that do not start with capital letters from `words`. This function will iterate over each word and call `is_all_caps`. If it returns true, keep the word. Otherwise, remove it. This function can be defined without using any built-in functions except for `each`, which has a constant number of method calls.\n```python\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    words = filter(&is_all_caps, words);\nend\n```\n\nFinally, define the main function that tests the solution using the provided input list of words `words`. This function should call `keep_only_names` and print out the result.\n```python\nfunction test()\n    words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bear\"];\n    keep_only_names(words);\nend\n```\nAnswer: The optimized algorithm would be defined in functions `is_all_caps`, `keep_only_names`, and `test`. It requires 3 method calls (`length`, `each`, `filter`) for the input list of words `[\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bear\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[102,611],"elapsed":16.159028959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
