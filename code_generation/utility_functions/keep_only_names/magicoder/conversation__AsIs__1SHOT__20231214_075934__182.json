Here is a function `keep_only_names` that does what you described:\n\n```\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    return [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes a list of words as input (`words`).\n* It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list of words.\n* It filters out all words that do not start with a capital letter by using the `if` statement. The `word[0].isupper()` check checks if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, then the word is kept in the list. Otherwise, it is removed from the list.\n* The function returns the filtered list of only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Capital\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Capital\"]\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[52,256],"elapsed":8.491545584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
