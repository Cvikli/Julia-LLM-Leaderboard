The `islowercase(first(x))` checks if the first character of the string `x` is lower case, i.e., not a capital letter. The `!isnumeric(x)` checks if the string `x` contains no numbers (which would make it impossible to be all uppercase).\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"123number\", \"Doggo\", \"Number\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # prints: Cat Doggo\n```\nPlease note, `islowercase` considers upper case letters with accents (like é, ü) as not being lower case. If you need to consider them as lower case, a different approach would be needed.","status":200,"tokens":[108,247],"elapsed":7.70762125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
