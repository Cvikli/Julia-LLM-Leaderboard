The predicate in this case checks if the first character of each word (converted to uppercase to be consistent with the problem statement) is equal to its own uppercase version, i.e., it's a capital letter.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"doggy\", \"Bear\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Bear\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,201],"elapsed":6.415644666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
