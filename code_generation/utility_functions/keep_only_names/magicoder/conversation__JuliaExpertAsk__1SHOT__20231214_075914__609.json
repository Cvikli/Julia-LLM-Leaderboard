Here is a function `keep_only_names` that does what you described:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> startswith(word, capitalize(word)), words)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `filter` function is used to create a new list where each element is replaced by the result of applying the function `startswith` to the original element.\n* The `startswith` function checks if the first character of the word is a capital letter. If it is, the word is kept in the filtered list. If not, the word is removed from the list.\n* The `capitalize` function is used to convert the word to a string, so that we can use the `startswith` function on each word in the list.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Capital\", \"lowercase\"]\nkept_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(kept_names) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Capital\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,246],"elapsed":8.579433,"_type":"aimessage"}]
