This is a concise way of creating new lists based on existing lists, often including or excluding certain conditions. \n\nHere's how you might define the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\nThis function goes through each word in the provided list. The `isuppercase` function checks if a character is upper case, and the `[1]` index returns the first letter of the string. If the first letter is an uppercase letter, it's included in the new list. Otherwise, it's ignored.\n\nHere's how you might call this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"mouse\", \"Elephant\"]\nprint(keep_only_names(words)) # prints [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,225],"elapsed":7.120715125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
