[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, let's create this `keep_only_names` function in Julia.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String}) \n    filter!(startswith(w -> isuppercase(w[1]), words)) do w\n        all(isletter, collect(eachchar(w)))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the built-in `filter!` method to remove elements from the array that do not pass a certain condition (the first character of the string should be uppercase). The condition `startswith(w -> isuppercase(w[1]), words)` checks if any word in `words` starts with an uppercase letter.\n\nThe anonymous function passed to filter! checks if all characters in each word are letters using `collect(eachchar(w))`, and `all(isletter, ...)`. \n\nPlease note that this will remove both words that do not start with a capital letter and words that contain non-letter characters.","status":200,"tokens":[372,218],"elapsed":8.257773042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
