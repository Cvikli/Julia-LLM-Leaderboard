The `islowercase(first(x))` checks if the first character of a string is a lowercase letter while `isuppercase(first(x))` checks if it's an uppercase letter. By using logical AND operator (`&&`), we ensure both conditions are satisfied. Hence, removing all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, \"dog\" but keeping \"Dog\").\nThe result will be: [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\"].","status":200,"tokens":[198,207],"elapsed":12.97538625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
