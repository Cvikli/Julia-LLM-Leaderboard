If it is, it adds that word to a new list (which is returned at the end).\n\nLet's test this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bear\", \"doggy\", \"Elephant\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThis should return `[\"Dog\", \"Bear\", \"Elephant\"]`. \n\nThe function uses the built-in `isuppercase` function to check if a character is uppercase. In Julia, strings are indexed just like arrays and you can get an individual character from the string using indexing with brackets [].","status":200,"tokens":[69,249],"elapsed":7.673745084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
