[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that solves your problem using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = String[]  # initialize the array of results\n\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis function `keep_only_names` takes an argument `words`, which should be a list of strings. It iterates over each string in the list and checks if the first character of that string is uppercase using the `isuppercase` built-in Julia function. If it's an uppercase letter, it adds the word to the result array.\n\nPlease note that this code will remove words with capital letters at any position (not just start), because in Julia string indices are 1-based. You may want to add some logic if you want to only consider words starting with a capital letter as in English grammar.","status":200,"tokens":[369,214],"elapsed":8.1326375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
