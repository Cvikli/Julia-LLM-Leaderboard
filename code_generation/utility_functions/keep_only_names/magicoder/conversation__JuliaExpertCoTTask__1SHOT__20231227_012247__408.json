The anonymous function checks whether the first character of each word (string slice `[1]`) is in uppercase using the `uppercase` function which converts all lowercase letters in a string to their corresponding uppercase counterparts and leaves all other characters as they are.\n\nHere's how you can call it:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nThis will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[198,196],"elapsed":12.507168458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
