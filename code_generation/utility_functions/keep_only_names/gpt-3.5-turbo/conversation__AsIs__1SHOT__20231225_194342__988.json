Finally, we return the resulting list.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"Elephant\", \"dog\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(names)  # Output: ['Dog', 'Bird', 'Elephant']\n```\n\nThis will remove the words \"cat\" and \"dog\" from the original list, keeping only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[61,181],"elapsed":3.116636208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
