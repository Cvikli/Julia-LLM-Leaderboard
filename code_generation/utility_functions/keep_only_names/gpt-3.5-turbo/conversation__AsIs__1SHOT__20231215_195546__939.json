It checks if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If it is uppercase, the word is kept in the resulting list. If it is not uppercase, the word is skipped and not included in the resulting list.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```python\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"mouse\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(filtered_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n['Dog', 'Elephant']\n```\n\nIn this example, the function removes the words \"cat\" and \"mouse\" because they do not start with a capital letter, and returns a new list containing only the words \"Dog\" and \"Elephant\".","status":200,"tokens":[61,214],"elapsed":4.402458792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
