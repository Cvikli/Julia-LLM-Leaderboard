[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"Write a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    return [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each word in the input list. It checks if the first letter of each word is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. If the first letter is uppercase, the word is kept in the resulting list. Otherwise, the word is skipped.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```python\nword_list = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Tree\", \"house\", \"Car\"]\n\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(word_list)\nprint(filtered_words)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n['Dog', 'Tree', 'Car']\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` is called with the `word_list` as an argument. It returns a new list `filtered_words` that contains only the words that start with a capital letter. The result is then printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[61,217],"elapsed":7.683030375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
