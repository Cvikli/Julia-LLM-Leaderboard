Here's the code for the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    names = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a list of words like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"orange\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\n\nHope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.","status":200,"tokens":[64,147],"elapsed":2.753605166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
