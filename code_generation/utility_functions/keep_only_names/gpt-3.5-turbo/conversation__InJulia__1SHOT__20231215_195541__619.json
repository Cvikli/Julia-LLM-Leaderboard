Here's the implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the `filter` function to iterate over each word in the `words` list and keep only the words that start with a capital letter. The `isuppercase` function is used to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. Finally, the filtered words are returned as the result.\n\nYou can test the function with a list of words like this:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"lion\", \"Tiger\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThe output will be `[\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Tiger\"]`, as it removes the words \"cat\" and \"lion\" which do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,203],"elapsed":4.540301916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
