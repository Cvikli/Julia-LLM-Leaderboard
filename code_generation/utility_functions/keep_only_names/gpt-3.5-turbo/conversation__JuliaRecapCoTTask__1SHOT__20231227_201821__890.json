[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this Task, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an empty array to store the filtered words.\n2. Iterate over each word in the input list.\n3. Check if the first character of the word is a capital letter.\n4. If the condition is true, add the word to the filtered list.\n5. Finally, return the filtered list of words.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nLet's test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"apple\", \"Banana\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThe output will be `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Banana\"]`, which is the list of words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[323,214],"elapsed":3.501974833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
