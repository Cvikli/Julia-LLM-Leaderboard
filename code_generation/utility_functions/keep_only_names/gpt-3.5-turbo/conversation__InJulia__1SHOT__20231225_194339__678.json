[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Write a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a sample implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    keep_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(first(word))\n            push!(keep_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return keep_words\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function to remove words from a given list that do not start with a capital letter. Here's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `keep_only_names` iterates over the `words` list and checks if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to the `keep_words` list. Finally, the function returns the `keep_words` list which contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,209],"elapsed":3.086308542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
