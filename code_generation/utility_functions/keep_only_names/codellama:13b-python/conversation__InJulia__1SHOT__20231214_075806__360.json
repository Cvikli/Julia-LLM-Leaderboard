Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    for word in words\n        if first(word) != uppercasefirst(word)\n            remove!(words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `for` loop iterates over the list of words `words`.\n* In each iteration, we check if the first character of the word is not a capital letter using the `first` function. If it's not, we remove the word from the list using the `remove` function.\n* After removing all non-capitalized words, we return the updated list of only the capitalized words using the `return` statement.\n\nYou can test the function with a sample list of words like this:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Capitalize\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThe output should be:\n```\n[\"Dog\", \"Capitalize\"]\n```\nNote that the `uppercasefirst` function is used to convert a word to its uppercase version. You can replace it with any other function that converts a string to its uppercase version, such as `toupper`.","status":200,"tokens":[69,289],"elapsed":9.694645375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
