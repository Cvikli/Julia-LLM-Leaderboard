Here's a possible implementation of `keep_only_names` in Julia:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names(words) = filter(word -> startswith(word, uppercase), words)\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `filter` is a built-in function in Julia that applies a function to each element of a list and returns a new list with the filtered elements.\n* `startswith` is a function in Julia that checks if a string starts with a given prefix. In this case, we use `uppercase` as the prefix to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"house\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) # [ \"Dog\", \"house\" ]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[98,184],"elapsed":6.536981875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
