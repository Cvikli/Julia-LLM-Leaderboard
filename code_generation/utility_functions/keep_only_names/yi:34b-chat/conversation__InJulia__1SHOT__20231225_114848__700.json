Here's how you might implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Capitalize each word for comparison\n    capitalized_words = map(String, words) do word\n        return uppercasefirst(word)\n    end\n    \n    # Filter out words that do not start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(w -> ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\", w), capitalized_words)\n    \n    # Return the list of filtered words\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nsome_words = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Mouse\", \"tiger\", \"zebra\"]\nkept_names = keep_only_names(some_words)\nprintln(kept_names)  # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Mouse\", \"Tiger\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function first capitalizes each word in the list using `uppercasefirst` and then uses a filter to remove any words that do not match the regex pattern `r\"^[A-Z]\"`, which matches words starting with an uppercase letter. Finally, it returns the filtered list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[71,328],"elapsed":43.507144458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
