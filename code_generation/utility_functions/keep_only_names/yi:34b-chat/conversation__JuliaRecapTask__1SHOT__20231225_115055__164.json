[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    # Start with an empty list to store the filtered words\n    capitalized_words = Vector{AbstractString}()\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the original list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character is uppercase\n        if occursin(uppercasefirst(word[1]), word)\n            # If yes, add it to the new list\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the list of words (`words`) and uses `occsin` to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to a new vector called `capitalized_words`. Finally, the new vector is returned as the filtered list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[382,202],"elapsed":34.258443417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
