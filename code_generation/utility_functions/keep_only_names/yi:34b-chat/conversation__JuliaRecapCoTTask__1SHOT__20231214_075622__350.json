[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started on solving the task at hand. Based on the provided instructions, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `split()` for splitting a string into an array of substrings\n\t* `startswith()` for checking if a string starts with a specific prefix\n\t* `subset()` for selecting a subset of elements from an array\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Create a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input\n\t* Iterate over the list using a `for` loop\n\t* Check if each word starts with a capital letter using `startswith()`\n\t* If it does, include the word in the output list\n\t* Otherwise, remove the word from the list\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Use `println()` to print out the resulting list of words to ensure it contains only words that start with capital letters\n\nHere's the code for `keep_only_names`:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractString)\n    # Split input string into an array of substrings\n    words_array = split(words, \" \")\n    \n    # Initialize output list to contain only words that start with capital letters\n    output = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the input words\n    for word in words_array\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if startswith(word, \" Capital Letter\")\n            # Add the word to the output list\n            push!(output, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the output list of words that start with capital letters\n    return output\nend\n```\nNote that we're using `AbstractString` as the input type to make sure the function can handle any string type. Also, we're using `startswith()` instead of `startswith()` for more generality.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on the code!","status":200,"tokens":[11,445],"elapsed":16.24843325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
