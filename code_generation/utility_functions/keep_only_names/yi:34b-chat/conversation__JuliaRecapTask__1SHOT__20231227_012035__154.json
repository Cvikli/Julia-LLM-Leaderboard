[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\n# Import the Iterators package for the `filter` function.\nusing Iterators\n\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use a filter to keep only words that start with a capital letter.\n    return collect(filter(word -> startsWithCapitalLetter(word), words))\nend\n\n# A utility function to check if a word starts with a capital letter.\nfunction startsWithCapitalLetter(word)\n    # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n    return isupper(first(word))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Horse\", \"rabbit\"]\nkept_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(kept_words) # Output should be: [\"Horse\"]\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `Iterators.filter` function to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter. The `startsWithCapitalLetter` function checks if the first character of a word is uppercase using the `isupper` function, which is part of Julia's standard library. The `first` function is used to get the first character of a string without losing its type (unlike `Char(word[1])`).\n\nThe example usage shows how the function would be called and prints out the expected result.","status":200,"tokens":[382,306],"elapsed":48.218733542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
