X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started on solving the task at hand. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* Iterating over a list of words using the `for` loop\n\t* Checking if a string starts with a capital letter using the `isequal` function\n\t* Creating a new list by removing elements from an existing list using the `filter` function\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Create a function `keep_only_names(words)` that takes a list of words as input and returns a new list with only the names that start with a capital letter.\n\t* Use a `for` loop to iterate over the input list `words`.\n\t* Check each word in the loop using `isequal` if it starts with a capital letter. If it does, add it to a new list called `keep_only_names`.\n\t* After the loop, return the `keep_only_names` list.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function by providing it with a list of words and verifying that only the names that start with capital letters are returned.\n\t* Use multiple examples to ensure the function works correctly for different input lists.\n\nHere is the implemented function:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    keep_only = []\n    for word in words\n        if isupper(word)\n            push!(keep_only, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return keep_only\nend\n```\nIn this function, we use the `for` loop to iterate over the input list of words. For each word, we check if it starts with a capital letter using the `isequal` function. If it does, we add it to a new list called `keep_only`. Finally, we return the `keep_only` list.\n\nLet me know if you would like me to run any additional tests or make any changes to the code based on your feedback!","status":200,"tokens":[369,444],"elapsed":19.308342542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
