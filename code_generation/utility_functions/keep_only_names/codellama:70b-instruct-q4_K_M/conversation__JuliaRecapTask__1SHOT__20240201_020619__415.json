[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(x -> !islowercase(first(x)), words)\nend\n```\nThe function `keep_only_names` takes an array of strings (`words`) and uses the `filter` function to remove all words that start with a lowercase letter. The `filter` function iterates over each word in the list, and applies the provided condition. If the condition returns true for any given element, it is kept, otherwise it is removed from the result.\nIn this case, we use an anonymous function (`x -> !islowercase(first(x))`) as the condition to check if a word starts with a lowercase letter (`!islowercase`). We negate `islowercase` using `!` because we want to keep words that do not start with a lowercase letter.\nThe `first` function returns the first character of each string in the array, and `islowercase` checks if it is a lowercase character. By combining these two functions, we can determine whether a word starts with an uppercase or lowercase letter.\nNote that this implementation assumes that all elements in the input list are strings (of type `AbstractString`). If the input list contains other types of elements, you may need to modify the function to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,304],"elapsed":16.44838914,"_type":"aimessage"}]
