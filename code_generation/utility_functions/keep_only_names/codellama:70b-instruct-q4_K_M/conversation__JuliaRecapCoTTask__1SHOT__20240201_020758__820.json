[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code for this task using Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})::Array{SubString}\n    filtered = filter(s -> startswith(s, uppercase), words)\n    return split.(filtered)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an array of strings (`words`) as input and returns a new array containing only the words that start with capital letters. It uses the `filter` function to create a new array containing only those elements that pass a certain test (in this case, if they start with a capital letter). Then it splits each element into an array of characters using the built-in `split` function and returns them.\n\nPlease note that the output type is not explicitly specified in the code above because Julia's type inference will automatically determine it based on the input provided to the function.","status":200,"tokens":[19,195],"elapsed":10.706648318,"_type":"aimessage"}]
