For each word in the array, we check if the first letter is uppercase using `isuppercase`. If it is, we add it to the `names` array. Finally, we return the `names` array after iterating through all words in the list.\n\nIn this example, the resulting filtered names would be: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Fish\"].","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":14.899979497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
