[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is my proposed solution:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if !isuppercase(first(word))\n            continue; # ignore the current word since it doesn't start with a capital letter\n        end\n        \n        push!(result, word); # add the word to our list of valid names\n    end\n    \n    return result;\nend\n```\n\nPlease note that I've made some assumptions:\n- The input list `words` can contain multiple words.\n- The function iterates through each word in the list and checks if it starts with a capital letter.\n- If a word doesn't start with a capital letter, it is not added to the result list (i.e., \"dog\" will be removed).\n- If a word does start with a capital letter, it is added to the result list (e.g., \"Dog\").\n\nThis function should provide a solution that meets the requirements of your task.
