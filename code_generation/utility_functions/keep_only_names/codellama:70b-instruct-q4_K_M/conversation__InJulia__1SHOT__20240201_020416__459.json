It's quite similar to Python and Ruby.\n```julia-repl\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String})::Array{String}\n    # Initialize an empty array to store the capitalized words.\n    result = String[]\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list of words.\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of the word is uppercase (capital letter).\n        if typeof(word[1]) == Char && isuppercase(word[1])\n            # Add the capitalized word to our result array.\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words as input and iterates over each word in the list using a for loop. It checks if the first character of each word is uppercase (capital letter) using the built-in functions `typeof`, `isuppercase`. If so, it adds that capitalized word to an empty array (`result`) using the `push!` function. Finally, when all words are checked, it returns the array containing only capitalized words as its output.","status":200,"tokens":[77,282],"elapsed":15.390959313,"_type":"aimessage"}]
