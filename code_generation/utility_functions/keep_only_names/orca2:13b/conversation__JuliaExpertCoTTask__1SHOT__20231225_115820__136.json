Define a function named `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as an input.\n2. Initialize an empty list to store the words that start with capital letters.\n3. Iterate over the input list of words using a for loop.\n4. For each word, check if it starts with a capital letter by comparing its first character to an uppercase letter.\n5. If the word starts with a capital letter, append it to the list of words that start with capital letters.\n6. After the loop, return the list of words that start with capital letters as the output of the function.\n\nHere is the code implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Initialize an empty list to store words that start with capital letters\n    result = []\n\n    # Iterate over the input list of words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the word starts with a capital letter\n        if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])\n            # Append the word to the result list\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # Return the result list\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with the given data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[201,341],"elapsed":29.419661542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
