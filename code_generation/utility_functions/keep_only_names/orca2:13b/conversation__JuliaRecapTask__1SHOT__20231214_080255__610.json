[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started on the task of writing a function `keep_only_names` that removes all words from a list (`words`) that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets (7 minutes)\n\n* Julia's built-in `split` function to split a string into an array of substrings\n* The `startswith` function to check if a string starts with a specific prefix\n* The `contains` function to check if a string contains a specific substring\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task (30 minutes)\n\n* Use the `split` function to split the input list of words into an array of substrings\n* Iterate over the array of substrings and use the `startswith` function to check if each substring starts with a capital letter\n* Use the `contains` function to check if any of the substrings do not start with a capital letter\n* Remove the substrings that do not start with a capital letter from the original list of words\n\nStep 3: Double-check the solution (5 minutes)\n\n* Verify that the resulting list of words only contains words that start with capital letters\n\nHere's the complete code for `keep_only_names`:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractString)\n    # Split input list into an array of substrings\n    words_array = split(words, \" \");\n    \n    # Iterate over array of substrings and remove non-capital letters\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words_array if startswith(word, \" Capital Letter\")];\n    \n    return filtered_words;\nend\n```\nNote that we're using the `AbstractString` type to indicate that the input list of words can be any string type (e.g., character array or symbol). We're also using the `startswith` function to check if a substring starts with a specific prefix, which in this case is \" Capital Letter\".\n\nStep 4: Review and Reflect (5 minutes)\n\n* Reflect on the problem-solving approach used in this task\n* Discuss any challenges or difficulties encountered during the task\n* Identify areas for improvement in the code or approach\n\nIn this task, we focused on using Julia's built-in functions to solve the problem efficiently and accurately. We also prioritized readability and maintainability by following a consistent naming convention and avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\nOverall, this task demonstrated the versatility of the Julia language in solving practical problems while adhering to best practices for programming.","status":200,"tokens":[369,572],"elapsed":24.24768325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
