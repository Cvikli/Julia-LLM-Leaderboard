It uses the `filter` function to iterate over the input vector and check if each word starts with a capital letter. If it does, the word is included in the output vector.\n\nYou can test this function by calling it on a vector of strings, like this:\n```\njulia> words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"Dog\", \"cat\"]\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"apple\"\n \"banana\"\n \"Dog\"\n \"cat\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":6.300678499,"_type":"aimessage"}]
