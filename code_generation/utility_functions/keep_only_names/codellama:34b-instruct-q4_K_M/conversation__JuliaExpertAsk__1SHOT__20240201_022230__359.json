If it is not, we remove that word from the list using the `filter!` function. The resulting vector of words is then returned by the function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input list contains only strings. If you need to handle other types of data, you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":4.391219523,"_type":"aimessage"}]
