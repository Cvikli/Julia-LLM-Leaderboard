For each word in the list, it checks whether the first letter is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function from the `Unicode` module. If the word does not start with a capital letter, it deletes that word from the vector using the `deleteat!` function.\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with a list of words as an argument:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\nprintln(words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,216],"elapsed":6.06739181,"_type":"aimessage"}]
