It applies the predicate to each element in the iterable, and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate returned `true`.\n* In this case, we use the `isuppercase` function from the Julia standard library to check if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. If it is, then the word is included in the resulting list; otherwise, it is excluded.","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":4.78781599,"_type":"aimessage"}]
