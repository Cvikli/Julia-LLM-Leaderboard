It applies the predicate function to each element of the iterable and returns a new iterable containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate.\n* The predicate function in this case is `isuppercase(word[1])`, which checks whether the first character of the word is an uppercase letter. If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,166],"elapsed":4.591631241,"_type":"aimessage"}]
