It applies the predicate to each element of the iterable and returns a new iterable containing only the elements for which the predicate returned true.\n* `isuppercase` is a built-in function that checks whether a character is uppercase.\n* `first(w)` returns the first character of the string `w`.\n* The anonymous function `w -> isuppercase(first(w))` checks whether the first letter of each word in the list is uppercase. If it is, the word is kept; otherwise, it is removed from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,201],"elapsed":5.687851385,"_type":"aimessage"}]
