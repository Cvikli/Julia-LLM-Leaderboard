Then, we iterate over the list of words and check if each word starts with a capital letter using the `isuppercase()` function. If the word starts with a capital letter, we add it to the `names` list using the `push!()` function. Finally, we return the `names` list.\n\n# Testing\n\nTo test this function, we can call it with a list of words and check if the output is correct:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names) # Should print [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,269],"elapsed":7.485578516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
