The `for` loop iterates over each word in the `words` list.\n2. The `if` statement checks if the first letter of the current word is not uppercase (using the `isuppercase()` function). If it isn't, then we know that the word does not start with a capital letter and should be removed from the list.\n3. The `deleteat!()` function is used to remove the current word from the list. We use `findfirst(==(word), words)` to get the index of the word in the list, and then pass that index to `deleteat!()` to remove it.\n4. After all words have been processed, the modified list is returned by the function.\n\nNote: This function modifies the original list. If you want to create a new list without modifying the original, you can use `filter()` instead of `for` loop and `deleteat!()`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":8.092131929,"_type":"aimessage"}]
