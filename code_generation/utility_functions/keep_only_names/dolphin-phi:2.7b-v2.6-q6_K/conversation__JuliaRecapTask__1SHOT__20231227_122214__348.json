[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can define a function `keep_only_names` that iterates over the provided list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter using type annotations and general syntax.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{String}) where isUppercase(word)\nnewWords = []\nfor word in words\nif isUppercase(word)\npush!(newWords, word)\nend\nend\nreturn newWords\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we iterate over each word in the provided list using a for loop. For each word, we check if it starts with a capital letter by using the `isUppercase` function which returns true if all the characters of a string are uppercase. If the word is indeed capitalized, we push it into a new array and return this array after the iteration. The function uses the `push!` method to add elements to an array in place, improving performance over appending each element individually with `append`. \n\nThe type annotation `AbstractArray{String}` specifies that the input parameter `words` is an array of strings. The type `isUppercase` is defined for a string type, returning true if all characters are uppercase. The function `keep_only_names` returns an array of strings, adhering to the requirements of the problem.\n\nThis solution does not rely on any external packages and is efficient in terms of memory usage and time complexity.","status":200,"tokens":[357,331],"elapsed":10.070989917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
