For each `word`, we use the `isupperfirstchar` function to check if the first character of the word is uppercase. If it is, we push the word into our result list (which we initially initialize as an empty list). Once all words have been processed, we return the result list.\nIn terms of complexity, this function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array `words`, since we need to iterate over each element exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst-case scenario all elements of the array are pushed into the result list, which contains at most n elements.","status":200,"tokens":[108,239],"elapsed":6.338722167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
