Here's how you could write the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\nresult = []\nfor word in words\nif isupper(firstchar(word))\npush!(result, word)\nend\nend\nreturn result\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the input list. It checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using `isupper(firstchar(word))`. If it is, the word is added to a new list called `result` with `push!`. Finally, `return result` returns the list of words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[108,191],"elapsed":5.14139075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
