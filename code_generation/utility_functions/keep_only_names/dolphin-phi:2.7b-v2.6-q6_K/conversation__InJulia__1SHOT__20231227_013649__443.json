For each word, it checks if the first letter is uppercase using `isupperfirst()`. If it is uppercase, the word is added to the result array with `push!(result, word)`. Finally, the function returns the result array.\n\nHere's how you could use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"giraffe\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) # This will return [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[71,199],"elapsed":5.202294541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
