It iterates over each word in the vector and uses the `firstmatch` function to check if the first character of the word is a capital letter (`[A-Z]`). If it is, the word is included in the output vector using list comprehension. The function then returns the vector of words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[196,165],"elapsed":8.330825292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
