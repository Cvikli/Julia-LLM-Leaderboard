It iterates over each word in the list, checks if it starts with a capital letter using the `starts-with` method and only includes it in the result if it does:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\nresult = Vector{String}()\nfor word in words\nif isupperfirst(word)\npush!(result, word)\nend\nend\nreturn result\nend\n```\nIn this function `isupperfirst(word)`, we check if the first letter of the string `word` is an uppercase letter. If it is, then the function returns true and continues to the next iteration. If not, the function immediately returns false and stops checking for the remaining words. The `push!(result, word)` statement appends each matching word to the beginning of the vector `result`, so that the first item in `result` will always be the first capitalized word in the input list.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Doggy\", \"Bird\", \"dog\", \"Cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nThis will output `[\"Dog\", \"Doggy\", \"Bird\"]`, which are the only words in the input list that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[71,315],"elapsed":8.170880583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
