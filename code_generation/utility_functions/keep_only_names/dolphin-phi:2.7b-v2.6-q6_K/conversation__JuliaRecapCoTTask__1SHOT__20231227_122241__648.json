[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, the function `keep_only_names` can be written as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractStringArray)\nnew_words = []\n\nfor word in words\nif word[1] == toupperfirst(word[1])\npush!(new_words, word)\nend\nend\n\nreturn new_words\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over the input list of words. For each word, it checks if the first character is uppercase. If so, it adds the word to a new list which will be returned at the end.\n\nIf there are no such words in the input, the function returns an empty list. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes you're using Python's built-in `toupperfirst` function and its syntax is slightly different from Julia. In Python, `toupperfirst(word[1])` will return the uppercase version of the first character in `word`. In Julia, there isn't a built-in equivalent for this so we use `word[1] == toupperfirst(word[1])` which performs the same check. \n\nAlso, in Python, we can directly add the word to the new list using `push!(new_words, word)`. In Julia, you need to first initialize an empty list with `new_words = []` and then use `push!(new_words, word)` inside the loop.","status":200,"tokens":[360,326],"elapsed":9.959200542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
