Here is how you can define this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered = [word for word in words if startswith(word, 'A':'Z')]\n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by creating a new array that includes only those elements of `words` for which the `startswith` condition is true. \n\nPlease note that this function doesn't remove strings that start with lowercase letters but are otherwise valid names (e.g., \"Dog\", \"DOG\"). If you need to handle such cases, you would have to add additional checks or use a regular expression for the name checking logic. The `startswith` function only checks if a string starts with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[70,195],"elapsed":32.912678625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
