[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that will achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    names = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])  # Check if the first letter is uppercase\n            pushdₓₜ(names, word)  # If it is, append to the `names` vector\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each word in the input list. For each word, it checks if the first character (accessed using indexing with `word[1]`) is uppercase (checked by `isuppercase(word[1])`). If it's uppercase, it appends that word to another list of names. The function then returns this list of names.","status":200,"tokens":[399,187],"elapsed":40.293575791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
