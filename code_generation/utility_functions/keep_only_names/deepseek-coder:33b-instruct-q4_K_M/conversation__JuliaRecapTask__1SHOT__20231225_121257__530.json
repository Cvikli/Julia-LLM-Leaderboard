[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\nThis function uses a list comprehension to create a new array of words that only includes those which start with an upper-case letter. `isuppercase` is used to check the first character of each word, and `word[1]` extracts it. \n\nFor example, if you call `keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\"])`, this function will return a list with only the words \"Dog\" and \"Apple\". \n\nPlease note that Julia uses 1-based indexing, meaning that `word[1]` is the first character of the word. The function `isuppercase` returns `true` if its argument is an upper-case letter, and `false` otherwise. Thus, `isuppercase(word[1])` checks whether the first character of each word in `words` is an upper-case letter or not.","status":200,"tokens":[397,243],"elapsed":49.493544416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
