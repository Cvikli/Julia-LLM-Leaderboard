Here is a simple implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1]) && isalpha(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\nIn the function above, `filter` takes two arguments: a predicate (a function that returns a boolean value) and an iterable. The predicate checks if the first letter of each word in the list is uppercase and is alphabetical. If both conditions are met, then it keeps the word; otherwise, it gets removed. \n\nHere's how you can test this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Elephant\", \"123\", \"@abc\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Should print: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]\n```\nIn the example above, only words starting with a capital letter are kept. All other words are removed. Note that this function doesn't remove words containing digits or special characters, it only removes lowercase words and non-alphabetical ones.","status":200,"tokens":[70,272],"elapsed":45.102876791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
