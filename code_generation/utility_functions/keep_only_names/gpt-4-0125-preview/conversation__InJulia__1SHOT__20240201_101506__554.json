In Julia, you can write a function `keep_only_names` as follows. This function iterates over the provided list of words and uses the `filter` function in conjunction with a lambda function to keep only those words that start with a capital letter. Capital letters have ASCII values ranging from 65 ('A') to 90 ('Z'), which can be checked using the `isuppercase` function for the first character of each word.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter the vector to keep words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Giraffe\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[\"Banana\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```\n\nIn this code, the `filter` function iterates through each word in the `words` vector. The lambda function `word -> isuppercase(word[1])` is applied to each element, returning `true` for words that start with a capital letter and `false` otherwise. Only elements for which the lambda function returns `true` are kept in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[64,278],"elapsed":32.192285834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
