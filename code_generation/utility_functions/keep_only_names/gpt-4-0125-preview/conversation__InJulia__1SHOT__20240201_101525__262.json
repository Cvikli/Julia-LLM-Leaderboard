This solution checks the first letter of each word in the provided list (`words`) and keeps only those words where the first letter is uppercase. Julia strings are UTF-8 encoded and indexed by byte positions, not character indices, so functions like `isuppercase()` that expect a character will work correctly when passed the first character of a string.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the list of words to keep only those that start with an uppercase letter\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Should print [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis effectively iterates over each word in `words`, applies the filter criteria (`isuppercase(first(word))`), and returns a new list containing only the words that meet this criterion. The `first(word)` function gets the first character of the word, and `isuppercase()` checks if this character is uppercase. Thus, the function `keep_only_names` keeps words starting with a capital letter and removes others.","status":200,"tokens":[64,248],"elapsed":19.695317958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
