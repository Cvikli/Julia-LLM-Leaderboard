Here's how you could write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = []\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first letter of the word is uppercase\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))\n            # If so, append the word to the filtered_words array\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Date\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis function goes through each word in the `words` list and checks if the word starts with an uppercase letter (by comparing the first letter of the word with its uppercase version). If it does, the word is added to the `filtered_words` array. After iterating through all the words, the function returns the `filtered_words` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,270],"elapsed":14.238761667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
