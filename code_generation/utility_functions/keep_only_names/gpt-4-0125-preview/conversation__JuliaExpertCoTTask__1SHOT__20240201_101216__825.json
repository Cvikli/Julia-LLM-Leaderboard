Inside the function, we will iterate over the provided list of words and use a conditional check to determine if the first letter of each word is uppercase. If it is, we keep the word; otherwise, we remove it. To achieve this, we can use list comprehension for cleaner and more efficient code.\n\nHere's how the solution will look:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Using list comprehension to filter words starting with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))\n```\n\nThis code defines the required function `keep_only_names` and then tests it with the provided example `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`. The expected output should be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` as these are the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[173,225],"elapsed":18.17242525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
