Julia's `isuppercase` function can be used to determine if the first character of a word is uppercase. Below is an example implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the list by keeping only the words that start with a capital letter\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis code defines the `keep_only_names` function, which takes a list of words as input and filters out the words that do not start with an uppercase letter. The `filter` function in Julia applies a given condition (in this case, checking if the first letter of a word is uppercase using `isuppercase(first(word))`) across all elements of the collection. Only the elements for which this condition returns `true` are kept in the resulting collection. The `first` function is used to access the first character of each word.\n\nNote: This code assumes that all words are non-empty strings. If there's a possibility of encountering empty strings, you might want to add additional checking to handle or ignore such cases appropriately.","status":200,"tokens":[64,291],"elapsed":28.497893,"_type":"aimessage"}]
