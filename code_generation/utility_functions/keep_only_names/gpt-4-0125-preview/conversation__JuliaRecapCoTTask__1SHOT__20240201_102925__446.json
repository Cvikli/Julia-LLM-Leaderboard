[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To tackle this problem, we'll create a Julia function called `keep_only_names`. The function will iterate over a list of words, and use a conditional check to see if the first letter of each word is uppercase. Julia provides a convenient `isuppercase()` function to check if a character is uppercase. We can use array comprehension to filter out the words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nHere is how the solution could be implemented:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter words that start with an uppercase letter\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\n\nLet's breakdown the solution:\n\n- The function `keep_only_names` is defined with one parameter `words` which is expected to be a vector of strings (`Vector{String}`).\n- Inside the function, an array comprehension is used to iterate through each word in `words`.\n- For each word, `isuppercase(word[1])` checks if the first character is uppercase. `word[1]` gets the first character of the word, and `isuppercase` evaluates to `true` if this character is uppercase.\n- Only the words for which `isuppercase(word[1])` returns `true` are included in the new array created by the comprehension.\n- This new array, which consists of words starting with a capital letter, is then returned by the function.\n\nPlease note, this solution assumes that `words` will not contain any empty strings because trying to access the first character (`word[1]`) of an empty string would result in an error. If you expect empty strings and want to safely handle them, the function could be slightly modified to include a check for string length.","status":200,"tokens":[323,361],"elapsed":36.271172625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
