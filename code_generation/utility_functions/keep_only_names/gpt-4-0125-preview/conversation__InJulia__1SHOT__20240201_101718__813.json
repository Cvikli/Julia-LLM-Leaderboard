In this case, you want to keep words that start with a capital letter. You can check if a word starts with a capital letter by comparing the ASCII code of the first character to see if it lies in the range of ASCII codes for capital letters (A-Z, 65-90). Alternatively, a more straightforward way in Julia would be to use the `isuppercase` function on the first character of the word. Here's how you could write the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use filter to apply a condition to each word in the array\n    # The condition checks if the first character of each word is uppercase\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Elephant\", \"cat\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Should print [\"Elephant\", \"Zebra\"]\n```\n\nThis function uses a lambda (anonymous function) as the first argument to `filter`, where `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` specifies that for each `word` in `words`, it should only keep those where the first character `first(word)` is uppercase. The `filter` function then returns a new array containing only the words that meet this condition.","status":200,"tokens":[64,304],"elapsed":23.930139792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
