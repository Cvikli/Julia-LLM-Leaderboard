I will define a function called `keep_only_names` that accepts a list of words as its parameter.\n2. The function will iterate through the list of words.\n3. For each word, the function will check if the first letter of the word is uppercase.\n4. If the first letter is uppercase, the word will be kept in the result list.\n5. If the first letter is not uppercase, the word will be removed, i.e., not added to the result list.\n6. After iterating through all words, the function will return the result list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n## Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n```\n\n## Step 3: Solve the task\n\nGiven the data `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`, I will apply the function `keep_only_names` to solve the task.\n\n```julia\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\n## Step 4: Check that your solution is correct\n\nThe expected output should be `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` because these are the words that start with a capital letter among the provided list.","status":200,"tokens":[173,303],"elapsed":32.280286166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
