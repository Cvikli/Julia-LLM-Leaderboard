Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task, it's important to remember that Julia strings are arrays of characters and that we can access the first character of a string using `string[1]`. We can use this alongside the `isuppercase` function to check if the first letter of a word is uppercase. The `filter` function can be utilized to iterate through the list and keep only the words that meet the specified condition. Let's solve the task following the outlined problem-solving steps.\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets That Will Be Useful for This Task\n\n1. **Accessing the First Character of a String:** `firstChar = word[1]`\n2. **Checking if a Character is Uppercase:** `isuppercase(char)`\n3. **Filtering Elements in an Array:** We can use an anonymous function with the `filter` function to apply our condition to each element.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\nBased on the recalled snippets and the clarification, here's how we can solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # filter words based on the condition that the first letter must be uppercase\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check That the Solution is Correct\n\nI should test the function with an example list of words to ensure it correctly filters out those not starting with an uppercase letter.\n\n```julia\ntest_words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"rabbit\", \"Lion\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(test_words)\n\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Expected output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Lion\"]\n```\n\nBy inspecting the expected output, we verify that the solution behaves correctly, filtering out \"cat\" and \"rabbit\", which do not begin with an uppercase letter, and keeping \"Dog\", \"Elephant\", and \"Lion\", which do.","status":200,"tokens":[323,387],"elapsed":20.812555959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
