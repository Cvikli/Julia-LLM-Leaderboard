[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the task, we will define a Julia function named `keep_only_names` that takes a single parameter, `words`, which is a list of strings. Inside the function, we will filter the words by checking if the first character of each word is uppercase. To check for an uppercase character, we can use the `isuppercase` function in Julia on the first character of each word. Remember to handle cases where a word might be empty to prevent accessing the first character of an empty string, which would result in an error.\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets that will be Useful for this Task\n\n- **Defining a function**: `function functionName(params) end`\n- **Lambda functions**: `x -> condition`\n- **Filtering**: `filter(condition, collection)`\n- **String manipulation**: Accessing the first character `str[1]`, checking if a char is uppercase `isuppercase(char)`\n- **Conditional statements**: `if-else` construct\n\n### Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the list to keep only words that start with an uppercase letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check that the Solution is Correct\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\nLet's run some test cases to ensure the function behaves as expected:\n\n1. `keep_only_names([\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Elephant\", \"mouse\"])` should return `[\"Cat\", \"Elephant\"]`.\n2. `keep_only_names([\"Julia\", \"python\", \"Lisp\", \"javaScript\"])` should return `[\"Julia\", \"Lisp\"]`.\n3. `keep_only_names([\"\", \"NotEmpty\", \"123NumericStart\", \"UpperCase\"])` should return `[\"NotEmpty\", \"UpperCase\"]`, noting that an empty string and a string starting with a number are correctly filtered out.\n4. `keep_only_names([])` should return `[]` indicating it works with an empty input list.\n\nLet's manually verify these results by running representative examples, bearing in mind these are illustrative and not an exhaustive test suite.","status":200,"tokens":[322,442],"elapsed":49.98515175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
