Create a function `keep_only_names` that accepts a list of strings, `words`.\n2. Iterate over `words`, and for each word, check if it starts with a capital letter. To do this, compare the first letter of the word to its uppercase version. If they match, it starts with a capital letter.\n3. Collect words that start with a capital letter in a new list.\n4. Return the new list.\n\n### Write any functions and other code you need\n\nHere is the code for the function based on the steps outlined:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n### Solve the task\n\nNow, let's use the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\n### Check that your solution is correct\n\nOutput should be: `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`","status":200,"tokens":[173,242],"elapsed":27.5910885,"_type":"aimessage"}]
