[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Let's follow the systematic approach to solve this task:\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets that will be Useful for this Task\nWe will need:\n- A function definition using `function` keyword.\n- A loop: `for` loop to iterate over the list of words.\n- String functions: specifically, we want to check if the first letter of a word is uppercase. We can use `isuppercase()` function combined with slicing or indexing to achieve this.\n- Conditional statements: `if` to check the condition whether to keep a word or not.\n- An array to store and return the filtered list of words that start with a capital letter.\n\n### Solve the Task\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{AbstractString, 1})\n    # Initialize an empty array to hold words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = String[]\n\n    # Loop through each word\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first letter is uppercase\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check that the Solution is Correct\nLet's verify the function by applying it to a mix of words:\n\n```julia\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"grape\", \"Orange\"])) # Expected: [\"Banana\", \"Orange\"]\n```\n\nThis function should iterate over each word in the input list, check if the first letter is uppercase (indicating it starts with a capital letter), and only keep those words. The result for the given example should be `[\"Banana\", \"Orange\"]`, as those are the words starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[322,350],"elapsed":36.885591041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
