Create the function `keep_only_names` which takes a list of words as a parameter.\n2. Within the function, iterate over the list of words.\n3. Check if each word starts with a capital letter. In Julia, this can be verified using the `isuppercase()` function.\n4. Filter the words that start with a capital letter and discard the others.\n5. Return the filtered list.\n\n## Write any functions and other code you need\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n## Solve the task\n\nWith the provided data `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`, the code would be executed as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\n## Check that your solution is correct\n\nThe expected output should be:\n\n```\n[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nGiven the approach and the execution of the task with the provided data, this confirms the solution is correct.","status":200,"tokens":[173,258],"elapsed":30.373905083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
