You can then filter the list based on this criterion. Below is an example of how you might implement the `keep_only_names` function.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter the list of words to include only those that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Giraffe\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\n\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Banana\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```\n\nIn this function, `words::Vector{String}` specifies that the input `words` should be a vector of strings. `::Vector{String}` specifies that the function returns a vector of strings. The `filter` function is used to keep only those words for which the condition `isuppercase(first(word))` holds true. `first(word)` gets the first character of the word, and `isuppercase` checks if that character is uppercase. Thus, only words starting with a capital letter are retained in the filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[64,284],"elapsed":21.553997292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
