Here's how you could write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the list of words to keep only those that start with an uppercase letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nNote that this implementation makes use of the `filter` function, which applies the given condition (the lambda function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`) to each element in the `words` array. The `first(word)` function gets the first character of the word, and `isuppercase` checks whether this character is an uppercase letter. This way, only the words that start with an uppercase letter are kept in the resulting list.","status":200,"tokens":[64,228],"elapsed":18.8942705,"_type":"aimessage"}]
