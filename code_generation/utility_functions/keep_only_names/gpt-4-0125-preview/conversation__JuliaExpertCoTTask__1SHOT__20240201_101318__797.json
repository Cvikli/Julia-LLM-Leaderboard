Initialize an empty list `filtered_words` to store words from the input list that start with a capital letter.\n2. Iterate over each word in the provided list `words`.\n3. For each word, check if it starts with an uppercase letter. This can be done by comparing the first letter of the word (`word[1]`) with its uppercase version (`uppercase(word[1])`). If the comparison indicates the first letter is uppercase, append the word to `filtered_words`.\n4. Return the `filtered_words` list.\n\n## Solution\n\nLet's implement the `keep_only_names` function according to the approach.","status":200,"tokens":[173,130],"elapsed":10.839497375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
