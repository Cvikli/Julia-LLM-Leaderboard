In Julia, a simple and efficient way to do this is by using the `filter` function and a lambda function for the condition. The condition can check if the first character of a word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function and ensuring the character is an alphabet letter using `isletter`. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filter(word -> begin\n                        if isempty(word)\n                            false\n                        else\n                            first_char = first(word)\n                            isletter(first_char) && isuppercase(first_char)\n                        end\n                    end, words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"lion\", \"Tiger\", \"parrot\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Tiger\"]\n```\n\nThis function works as follows:\n- It uses the `filter` function which iterates over each element in `words`.\n- For each `word`, it checks if the word is not empty (to safely call `first(word)` without error).\n- It then checks if the first character of the word is a letter and also uppercase.\n- If both conditions are met, the word is passed through; otherwise, it's filtered out.\n- The resulting list contains only the words that start with an uppercase letter, assuming these represent names.","status":200,"tokens":[64,331],"elapsed":29.186181167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
