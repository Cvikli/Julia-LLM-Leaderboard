Here's a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of words to it. For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"bird\", \"Elephant\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print `[\"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]`, as it removes the word \"bird\" because it does not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,140],"elapsed":2.994369458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
