Here's a function `keep_only_names` in Julia that does what you've described:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing a list of words to it, and it will return a new list with only the words that start with a capital letter. For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[64,131],"elapsed":3.073792792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
