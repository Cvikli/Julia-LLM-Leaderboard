[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Since no special instructions were provided, I will follow the general Julia programming guidelines.\n\nHere's a solution to the Task:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty list to store the filtered words\n    filtered_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the provided list of words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first letter of the word is capital\n        if isupper(first(word))\n            # If it's capital, add it to the filtered_words list\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the filtered list of words\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nTo use this function with an example list of words:\n```julia\nexample_list = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Apple\", \"apple\", \"Julia\", \"julia\"]\nfiltered_list = keep_only_names(example_list)\nprint(filtered_list)  # Output: [ \"Dog\", \"Apple\", \"Julia\" ]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[383,253],"elapsed":11.991493625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
