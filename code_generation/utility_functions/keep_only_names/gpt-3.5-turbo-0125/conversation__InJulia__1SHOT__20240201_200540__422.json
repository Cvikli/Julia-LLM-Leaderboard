You can use the function by passing a list of words as an argument. For example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[64,133],"elapsed":1.307308375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
