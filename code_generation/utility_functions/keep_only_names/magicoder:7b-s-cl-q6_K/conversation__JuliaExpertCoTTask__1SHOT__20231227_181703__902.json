Filter! is similar to map!, but instead of applying a function to every element it removes elements for which the filter function returns false. For each word in words, if the first character (accessed using uppercase(word[1]) as Julia is 1 indexed) is not a capital letter, we remove that word from the array with the help of `filter!` function. The resultant array after applying this function will only contain words which start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[198,202],"elapsed":12.128825542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
