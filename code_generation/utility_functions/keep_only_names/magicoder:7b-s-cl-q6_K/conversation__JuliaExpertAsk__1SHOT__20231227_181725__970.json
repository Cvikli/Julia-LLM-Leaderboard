The `startswith` function checks whether a string starts with another string, and the `uppercase` function transforms all characters of a string into their uppercase equivalent. The `filter` function applies this check for each word and only includes those that pass (i.e., those whose first character is an uppercase letter).","status":200,"tokens":[108,145],"elapsed":8.438324084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
