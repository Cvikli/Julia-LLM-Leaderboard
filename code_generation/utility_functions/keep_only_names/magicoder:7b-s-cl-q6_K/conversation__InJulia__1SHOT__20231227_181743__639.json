The `startswith` function checks if a string starts with another string. For each word, it checks whether the first character of the word (after converting to uppercase) matches the first character of the word itself. If they don't match, the word is removed from the array.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Dog\", \"Bear\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n```\nAfter running this code, `words` would be updated to `[\"Cat\", \"Dog\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[69,207],"elapsed":11.331000584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
