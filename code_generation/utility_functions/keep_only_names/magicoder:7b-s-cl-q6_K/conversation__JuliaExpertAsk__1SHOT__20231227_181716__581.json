The `islowercase(first(x))` checks if the first character (the only one in this case because we're checking word by word) is lower case or not, i.e., it starts with an upper case letter. If it does then that word is kept and returned as part of the new list otherwise it gets filtered out.\n\nHere's how you can call this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words))  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[108,222],"elapsed":12.451645542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
