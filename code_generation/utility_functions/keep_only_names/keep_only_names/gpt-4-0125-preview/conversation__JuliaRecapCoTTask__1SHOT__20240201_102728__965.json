[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create a function that filters out all the words from a list that do not start with a capital letter in Julia, we'll use the `filter` function along with an anonymous function that checks the first letter of each word.\n\nHere's an approach to solving this task:\n\n### Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\n- Filtering: `filter(condition, collection)`\n- Accessing the first character of a string: `str[1]`\n- Checking if a character is uppercase: `isuppercase(char)`\n- String to Character Array: `collect(str)`\n\n### Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the words that start with a capital letter\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nVerify the function works as expected with a few test cases.\n\n```julia\n# Test 1\nwords1 = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"rabbit\", \"Zebra\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words1))  # Expected output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Zebra\"]\n\n# Test 2\nwords2 = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"grapefruit\", \"Orange\", \"watermelon\", \"Peach\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words2))  # Expected output: [\"Banana\", \"Orange\", \"Peach\"]\n\n# Test 3: Case with no capital letter - all should be filtered out\nwords3 = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"grapefruit\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words3))  # Expected output: []\n```\n\nThis implementation effectively iterates over the given list `words`, applies the condition of checking whether the first character of each word is uppercase, and filters out those that do not meet the criteria.","status":200,"tokens":[323,373],"elapsed":38.934625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
