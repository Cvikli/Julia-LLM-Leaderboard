The function will iterate through the list, checking each word to determine if it starts with a capital letter. In Julia, you can use the `isuppercase()` function to check if a character is uppercase. To ensure we're checking the first character of a word, we use indexing `[1]` on the string (as strings in Julia are indexable and UTF-8 aware). Finally, the function will return a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nHere’s how you can write this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Filter words that start with an uppercase letter. \n    # The Unicode.isuppercase function is used to ensure proper handling of Unicode characters\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis version uses the `filter` function, along with an anonymous function (`word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])`) that tests if a word is non-empty and starts with an uppercase letter. This method is concise and makes use of Julia's capabilities for handling Unicode characters (as indicated by the usage of `isuppercase` rather than a more basic ASCII check).\n\nLet’s test this function with an example:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Dates\", \"\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n[\"Banana\", \"Dates\"]\n```\n\nThis demonstrates that the function successfully filters out \"apple\", \"cherry\", and the empty string, keeping only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,374],"elapsed":26.101260792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
