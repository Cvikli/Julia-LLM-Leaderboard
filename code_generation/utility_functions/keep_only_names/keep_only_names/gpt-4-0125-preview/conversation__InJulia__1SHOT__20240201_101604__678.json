Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words where the first letter is uppercase\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"rabbit\", \"Zebra\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)\n```\n\nIn this function, `filter` is used with a lambda function that checks if the first character of each word (`first(word)`) is uppercase (`isuppercase`). The `filter` function iterates over each word in the `words` list, applying the condition, and only retains the words that satisfy this condition, effectively keeping only words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,179],"elapsed":12.706340708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
