[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we'll define a Julia function named `keep_only_names` that accepts a list of words. The function will filter out words that do not start with a capital letter. We'll use the standard Julia functions and control structures to accomplish this, emphasizing clarity and performance.\n\nFirst, recall that we can check if a character is uppercase in Julia using the `isuppercase` function. Since we need to check only the first character of each word, we can use `isuppercase(word[1])` to filter the words.\n\nLet's now write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter words to keep only those that start with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the provided list `words`, checks if the first character of each word is uppercase, and keeps only those words.\n\nLet's double-check to ensure this solution is correct:\n\n- The function correctly iterates over all items in the provided list.\n- It properly uses the `filter` function to select words that begin with an uppercase letter, based on the condition `isuppercase(word[1])`.\n- The function returns a new list containing only the words that passed the filter condition.\n\nTherefore, the solution appears to be correct according to the requirements outlined in the task.","status":200,"tokens":[322,283],"elapsed":22.822136791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
