[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task and the guidelines, the solution in Julia would involve iterating over the provided list of words and filtering out the words that do not start with a capital letter. This can be accomplished by using the `filter` function and checking the ASCII value of the first character of each word to determine if it is uppercase (ASCII values 65-90).\n\nHere's how the solution can be structured:\n\n1. Define the function `keep_only_names`.\n2. Use the `filter` function to iterate over the list of words.\n3. For each word, check if the first character is uppercase. This can be done by checking if the ASCII code of the first character falls within the range for uppercase letters (65-90).\n4. Return the filtered list.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Filter the words where the first character is uppercase\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\n**Double-check if the solution is correct:** \n\n- The function should correctly filter only those words that start with a capital letter.\n- We make use of `isuppercase` to check if the first character of each word is uppercase, which is a more direct and readable strategy than comparing ASCII values.\n- By using `filter`, the function remains concise and clear, adhering to the guidelines of emphasizing performance and clarity.\n\nThis code snippet fulfills the task requirements and follows the Julia language guidelines specified.","status":200,"tokens":[323,305],"elapsed":30.3477435,"_type":"aimessage"}]
