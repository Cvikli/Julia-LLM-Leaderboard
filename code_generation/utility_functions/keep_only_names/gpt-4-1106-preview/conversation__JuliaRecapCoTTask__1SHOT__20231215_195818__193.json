[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we will define a function `keep_only_names` in Julia that takes an array of strings as input and returns a new array containing only the strings that start with a capital letter. We will use the `isuppercase` function to check the first character of each string.\n\nHere are the steps we will follow:\n\n1. Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes an array of strings as an argument.\n2. Iterate over the array of strings.\n3. Check if the first character of each string is uppercase using `isuppercase`.\n4. If the first character is uppercase, keep the string; otherwise, discard it.\n5. Return the filtered array of strings.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{AbstractString, 1})\n    # Filter the array to keep only words that start with an uppercase letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nNow let's double-check the solution with some test cases:\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\"])) # Should return [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Date\"])) # Should return [\"Banana\", \"Date\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"\", \"Notempty\", \"alsoEmpty\", \"\"])) # Should return [\"Notempty\"]\n```\n\nThe function should correctly filter out words that do not start with a capital letter and return the remaining words.","status":200,"tokens":[323,333],"elapsed":24.112888292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
