In Julia, you can define a function `keep_only_names` to iterate over a list of words and filter out the ones that don't start with a capital letter. You can make use of the `isuppercase` function to check the first character of each word. Here's how you could implement such a function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Filter the words that start with uppercase letters only\n    filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords_list = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nThis function relies on the built-in `filter` function, which applies a condition to each element in the array. The condition is given as an anonymous function (`word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])`), which checks if the word is not empty and if the first character is uppercase.\n\nRemember that in Julia, indexing starts at 1, so `word[1]` refers to the first character of a word. The `isuppercase` function is used to check if this character is uppercase. The `filter` function will return a new array containing only the words that meet the specified condition.","status":200,"tokens":[64,284],"elapsed":24.639212375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
