[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a Julia function `keep_only_names` that takes an array of strings as input and returns a new array containing only the strings that start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{<:AbstractString})\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nTo ensure that this code is correct, let's create some test cases to verify its behavior:\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Alice\", \"bob\", \"Charlie\", \"david\"])) # Should return [\"Alice\", \"Charlie\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Tree\", \"house\", \"Mountain\"])) # Should return [\"Tree\", \"Mountain\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"123\", \"StartsWithNumber\"])) # Should return [\"StartsWithNumber\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"noCaps\", \"\", \"EmptyString\"])) # Should return [\"EmptyString\"] (assuming an empty string is considered starting with a capital letter)\nprintln(keep_only_names([])) # Should return an empty array\n```\n\nNote that the assumption made for an empty string is that it does not start with a lowercase letter, and since it's ambiguous, it's kept in the returned array. However, if you would prefer to have it removed, please let me know and I can adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[323,276],"elapsed":20.807697667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
