[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\n- Iterate over an array: `for word in words`\n- Remove elements from an array: Create a new array and only add the items that comply with the condition\n- Check if a string starts with a capital letter: In Julia, this can be done by checking if `word[1]` is in `uppercase` using `isuppercase`\n- Function definition syntax in Julia: `function f(args) ... end` \n\n# Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Initialize an empty array to store words with a capital letter\n    capitalized_words = String[]\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the words array\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)  # Keep the word if it starts with a capital letter\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return capitalized_words  # Return the filtered list of words\nend\n```\n\n# Double-check that the solution is correct\n- The function definition and syntax are according to the Julia programming style.\n- `isuppercase` correctly checks if the first character of a string is uppercase.\n- `push!` adds an element to the end of the array, which is used here to construct the resulting array.\n- The function returns an array of strings that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[322,285],"elapsed":23.645576834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
