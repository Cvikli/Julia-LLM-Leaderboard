[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we can define a function `keep_only_names` that takes an array of strings as input and filters out the strings that do not start with a capital letter. We can use the `isuppercase` function to check if the first character of a string is uppercase.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. Define the function `keep_only_names` that accepts an array of strings.\n2. Iterate over the array and use a filter to keep only the strings that start with an uppercase letter.\n3. Return the filtered array.\n\nLet's implement this in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{AbstractString, 1})\n    # Filter the words that start with an uppercase letter\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's double-check the solution to ensure it works correctly:\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\"])) # Should return [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Date\"])) # Should return [\"Banana\", \"Date\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"\", \"Notempty\", \"alsoEmpty\", \"\"])) # Should return [\"Notempty\"]\n```\n\nThe function should correctly filter out words that do not start with a capital letter and return the remaining words.","status":200,"tokens":[322,304],"elapsed":25.91392525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
