Below is a Python function that does exactly that. It iterates over the list of words and uses a list comprehension to filter out any word that does not start with a capital letter. In Python, the `str.istitle()` method can be used to check if a string starts with a capital letter and the rest of the characters are lowercase, which is typically the case for proper nouns (names). However, if you want to keep any word that simply starts with an uppercase letter (regardless of the case of the following letters), you can use the `str.isupper()` method on the first character of the word.\n\nHere's the function using `str.istitle()`:\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    # Using str.istitle() to check for title-cased strings (first letter capitalized, rest lowercased)\n    return [word for word in words if word.istitle()]\n\n# Example usage:\nwords_list = ['Alice', 'bob', 'Charlie', 'delta', 'Echo']\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprint(filtered_words)  # Output: ['Alice', 'Charlie', 'Echo']\n```\n\nAnd here's the version that keeps any word starting with an uppercase letter, regardless of the case of the following letters:\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    # Using str.isupper() on the first character to check for any uppercase starting letter\n    return [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\n\n# Example usage:\nwords_list = ['Alice', 'bob', 'Charlie', 'delta', 'Echo', 'Foxtrot']\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprint(filtered_words)  # Output: ['Alice', 'Charlie', 'Echo', 'Foxtrot']\n```\n\nRemember to handle the case where a word might be an empty string to avoid `IndexError` when accessing the first character.","status":200,"tokens":[61,390],"elapsed":39.330359791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
