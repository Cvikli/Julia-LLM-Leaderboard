[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is the Julia function `keep_only_names` that iterates over a list of words and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    # Using filter to keep only the words starting with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(w -> isuppercase(first(w)), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nI will now check if the function works correctly by testing it with different inputs.\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"mouse\", \"Rat\"]))  # Expected: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Rat\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"grape\", \"Pineapple\"]))    # Expected: [\"Banana\", \"Pineapple\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Horse\", \"iguana\"]))            # Expected: [\"Cat\", \"Horse\"]\n```\n\nThe function should filter out words like \"cat\" or \"apple\" which do not start with a capital letter and keep words like \"Dog\" or \"Banana\" which do start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[323,257],"elapsed":16.09092575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
