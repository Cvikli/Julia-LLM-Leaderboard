Here's the function `keep_only_names` which will iterate over the provided list of `words` and filter out the words that do not begin with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filter(word -> !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nYou call this function with a list of words as follows:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Alice\", \"bob\", \"Charlie\", \"delta\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Alice\", \"Charlie\"]\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` method, which takes a lambda function that checks each element in the `words` vector. The `word` is kept in the resulting list if the lambda function returns `true`. In this case, the lambda function checks that the string is not empty (to ensure there's a character to check) and that the first character is uppercase. If both conditions are met, the `filter` function will include that word in the output list.","status":200,"tokens":[64,245],"elapsed":12.5192145,"_type":"aimessage"}]
