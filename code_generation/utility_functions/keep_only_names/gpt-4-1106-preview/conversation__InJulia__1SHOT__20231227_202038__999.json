Here is a sample implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the array by keeping only the words that start with an uppercase letter\n    filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n- `filter` is used to process each element in the `words` array according to a Boolean condition.\n- `word -> isuppercase(first(word))` is a lambda (anonymous function) that takes each `word` as an argument and returns `true` if the first character of the word is uppercase, and `false` otherwise.\n- `first(word)` gets the first character of the word to check if it is uppercase.\n\nRunning this function will remove any word that doesn't start with an uppercase letter from the given list `words`.","status":200,"tokens":[64,239],"elapsed":19.02365025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
