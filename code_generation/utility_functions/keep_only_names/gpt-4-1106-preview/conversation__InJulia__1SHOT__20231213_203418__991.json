Below is a sample implementation of the function using a list comprehension, which is a concise way of creating a new list by iterating over each element in an existing list and testing a condition.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Use a list comprehension to keep words that start with an uppercase letter.\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"Julia\", \"world\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Python\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Julia\", \"Dog\", \"Python\"]\n```\n\nThe `isuppercase` function checks whether the first character of the word is an uppercase letter. The indexing `word[1]` gets the first character of the word.\n\nMake sure to note that `isuppercase` will throw an error if the word is an empty string because it would be trying to access the first character of an empty sequence. You can add an additional condition to skip empty strings if necessary. Here's an updated function that is robust to empty strings:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the words by checking that they're non-empty and start with an uppercase letter.\n    return [word for word in words if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"hello\", \"\", \"Julia\", \"world\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"\", \"Python\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Julia\", \"Dog\", \"Python\"]\n```\n\nThis version first checks that the word is not empty using `isempty` before checking the case of the first letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,382],"elapsed":44.328948041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
