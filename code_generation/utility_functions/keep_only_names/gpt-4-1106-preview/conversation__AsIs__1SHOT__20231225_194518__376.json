This function will filter out words from a list that do not start with a capital letter, which typically denotes proper nouns or names.\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    # Create a new list to store the names with capital letters\n    capitalized_words = []\n\n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the first character is uppercase\n        if word[0].isupper():\n            # If it is, add the word to our new list\n            capitalized_words.append(word)\n\n    # Return the list containing only the words with initial capital letters\n    return capitalized_words\n\n# Example usage:\nwords_list = [\"apple\", \"Boston\", \"cat\", \"Denver\"]\nfiltered_list = keep_only_names(words_list)\nprint(filtered_list)  # Output: [\"Boston\", \"Denver\"]\n```\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function checks each word in the `words` list to see whether the first character is uppercase using `word[0].isupper()`. If the initial letter is uppercase, it assumes the word is a name or a proper noun and adds it to a new list called `capitalized_words`. It then returns this filtered list.","status":200,"tokens":[61,262],"elapsed":12.746312708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
