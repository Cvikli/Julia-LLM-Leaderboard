Define a function called `keep_only_names` that takes a list `words` as its parameter.\n2. Use list comprehension to iterate through `words`.\n3. For each word, check if it starts with a capital letter (`str.istitle()` can be used for this purpose).\n4. Create a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n5. Return the new list.\n\n## Write any functions and other code you need\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # List comprehension to keep only words starting with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n## Solve the task\n\nThe code provided above is the solution to the task.\n\n## Check that your solution is correct\n\nNow we will test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\nWe expect to get the output `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` since \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\" start with capital letters, while \"banana\" and \"dog\" do not.","status":200,"tokens":[173,254],"elapsed":18.413570084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
