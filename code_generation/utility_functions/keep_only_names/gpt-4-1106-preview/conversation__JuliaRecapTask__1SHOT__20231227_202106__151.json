X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I will write a Julia function `keep_only_names` which takes an array of strings, iterates through it, and selects only those words that start with a capital letter. In Julia, we can check if the first character of a word is uppercase by using the `isuppercase` function.\n\nHere are the steps that we will perform within the function:\n\n1. Initialize an empty array to store the result.\n2. Iterate over each word in the input array.\n3. Check if the first character of the current word is in uppercase.\n4. If it is, add the word to the result array.\n5. After the loop, return the result array.\n\nLet's write the code for this function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{AbstractString,1})\n    # Initialize an empty array to keep words that start with uppercase letters\n    filtered_words = String[]\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the provided list of words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character is uppercase\n        if isuppercase(word[1])\n            # If it is, add it to the list of words to keep\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    # Return the list of words that start with uppercase letters\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's double-check that the solution is correct by testing the `keep_only_names` function with some example inputs.\n\n```julia\n# Test cases\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"cherry\", \"Date\"])) # Should output [\"Banana\", \"Date\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"hello\", \"World\", \"julia\", \"Language\"])) # Should output [\"World\", \"Language\"]\nprintln(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"bird\"])) # Should output [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[322,393],"elapsed":28.336380292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
