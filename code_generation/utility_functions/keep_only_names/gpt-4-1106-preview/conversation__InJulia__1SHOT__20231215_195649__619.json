In Julia, you can define the function `keep_only_names` to filter out words that do not start with a capital letter using the following code:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Filter the list of words to keep only those that start with a capital letter\n    return filter(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"Alice\", \"bob\", \"Charlie\", \"delta\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Alice\", \"Charlie\"]\n```\n\nThis function uses the `filter` function to keep only the words that satisfy the condition specified by the lambda function `word -> isuppercase(first(word))`. The `first(word)` function gets the first character of the word, and `isuppercase` checks if that character is an uppercase letter. If the condition is true, the word is kept; otherwise, it is filtered out.","status":200,"tokens":[64,194],"elapsed":17.011726583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
