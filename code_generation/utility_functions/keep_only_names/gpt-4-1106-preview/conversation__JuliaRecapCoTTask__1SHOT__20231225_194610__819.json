[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To accomplish this task, I will write a function `keep_only_names` in Julia, that filters out words from a provided list based on whether they start with a capital letter. To determine if a word starts with a capital letter, I'll check if the Unicode category for the first character is \"Uppercase_Letter\".\n\nHere are the steps to write this function:\n\n1. Define the function with an appropriate parameter.\n2. Use a comprehension to iterate over the list of words.\n3. For each word, check if the first character is uppercase.\n4. Return the filtered list.\n\nNow, let's write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{<:AbstractString})\n    # Keep words that start with an uppercase letter\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nI will now verify that this function works correctly by testing it with some input cases.","status":200,"tokens":[323,199],"elapsed":12.294958541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
