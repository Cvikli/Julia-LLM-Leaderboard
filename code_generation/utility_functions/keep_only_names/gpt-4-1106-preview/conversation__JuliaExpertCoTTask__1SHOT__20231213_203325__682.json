Define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input.\n2. Iterate over the list of words.\n3. Check for each word if it starts with a capital letter.\n4. If the word starts with a capital letter, keep it; otherwise, remove it from the list.\n5. Return the filtered list.\n\n## Code Implementation\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    # Filter the words list to keep only words starting with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(w -> isuppercase(w[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n## Solve the task\n```julia\n# Example data provided\nexample_words = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\n\n# Call the function with the example data\nresult = keep_only_names(example_words)\n```\n\n## Check that the solution is correct\n```julia\n# The expected output would be [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"] since these words start with a capital letter\nprintln(result) # Should print [\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]\n```\n\n## Run the example to confirm\nWhen this code is executed in a Julia environment, it should print `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` confirming that the function works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[173,270],"elapsed":20.417651458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
