The `filter` function will keep only those words for which the anonymous function returns `true`.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Cherry\", \"dog\"]\n\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output should be [\"Apple\", \"Cherry\"]\n```\n\nThis will print out the filtered list with only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[64,177],"elapsed":9.186094542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
