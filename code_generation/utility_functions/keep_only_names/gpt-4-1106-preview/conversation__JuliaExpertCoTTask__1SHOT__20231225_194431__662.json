Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes one argument, `words`, which is a list of strings.\n2. Iterate over each word in the `words` list.\n3. Check if the first character of each word is uppercase. In Julia, the `isuppercase` function can be used to test this.\n4. If the first character is uppercase, keep the word; otherwise, exclude it from the results.\n5.
