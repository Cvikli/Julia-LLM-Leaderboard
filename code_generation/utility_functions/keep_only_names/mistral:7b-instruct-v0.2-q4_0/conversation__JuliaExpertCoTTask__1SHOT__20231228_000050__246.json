Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Create a function called `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as an argument.\n   - Iterate over each word in the list and check if it starts with a capital letter.\n   - If a word starts with a capital letter, keep it in a new list.\n   - Return the new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{String})\n    result :: AbstractVector{String} = []\n\n    for word in words\n        if isfirstletter(word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z')\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nThe expected output should be `[\"Apple\"]`. The function correctly filters out words like 'banana', 'carrot' and 'dog'.","status":200,"tokens":[197,293],"elapsed":10.016046625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
