The `AbstractVector{String}` type is used for the input argument which allows using various vector types like Array{String}.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"apple\", \"Banana\", \"dog\", \"Elephant\"]\n4-element Array{String,1}:\n \"apple\"\n \"Banana\"\n \"dog\"\n \"Elephant\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Apple\"\n \"Banana\"\n \"Elephant\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[66,287],"elapsed":9.098512333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
