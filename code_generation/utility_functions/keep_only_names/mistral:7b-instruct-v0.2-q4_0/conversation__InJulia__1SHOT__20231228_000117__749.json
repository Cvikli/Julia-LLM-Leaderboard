Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{String})\n    filtered_words = filter(!isempty, words) # Remove empty strings first\n    filtered_words = filter(x -> occursin(\"^[A-Z]\", x), filtered_words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function takes an abstract vector of strings as its argument. The `filter!` function is used to remove empty strings at the beginning. After that, the `filter` function checks each word using regular expression matching (`occursin(\"^[A-Z]\" x)`) to find if it starts with a capital letter. Finally, the filtered list of words is returned as the result.","status":200,"tokens":[66,209],"elapsed":6.720726042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
