[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Recall Julia snippets:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})\n    # Your code here\nend\n```\n\nSolution:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, \"A\":'Z') || startswith(word, ' ')\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    result\nend\n```\n\nDouble-check:\n1. The function is named `keep_only_names`.\n2. It accepts a single argument `words`, which is an abstract array of strings.\n3. An empty list `result` is initialized to store the words that meet the condition.\n4. A for loop is used to iterate over each word in the input.\n5. The condition checks if a word starts with a capital letter or has a leading space, and if so, it is added to the result list using the `push!` function.\n6. Finally, the result list is returned at the end of the function.\n\nThis solution should correctly keep only the names that start with a capital letter from the provided list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[372,280],"elapsed":10.573570625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
