[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and without any special instructions, here's how you can write the function `keep_only_names` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, \"A:\"U) # check if the first character is uppercase\n            pushfirst!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filter!(x -> length(x) > 0, filtered_words) # remove empty strings\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The function takes an abstract array of abstract strings as its argument.\n2. We initialize an empty list called `filtered_words`.\n3. Using a `for` loop, we iterate over each word in the input list.\n4. Using the `startswith()` function, we check if the first character of the current word is uppercase (i.e., starts with a capital letter). If it does, then we add that word to our filtered list using the `pushfirst!()` function.\n5. Finally, we use the `filter!()` function to remove any empty strings from the filtered list before returning it as the final output.","status":200,"tokens":[372,284],"elapsed":10.667685291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
