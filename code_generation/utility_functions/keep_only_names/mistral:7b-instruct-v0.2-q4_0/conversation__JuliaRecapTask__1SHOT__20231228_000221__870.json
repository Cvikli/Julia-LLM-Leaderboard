[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the given problem statement and without any special instructions provided, here's how you can implement the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{<:AbstractString})\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, 'A':'Z') || startswith(word, ' ') # Check if the first character is a capital letter or a space\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    result\nend\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of this solution:\n\n1. `function keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{<:AbstractString})` - The function definition begins with the keyword `function`, followed by the name `keep_only_names`, and the list of formal parameters `words`. We define the type of `words` as an abstract array containing abstract strings.\n2. `result = []` - We initialize an empty array called `result` to store the names that we want to keep.\n3. `for word in words` - We iterate through each element `word` in the `words` array using a `for` loop.\n4. `if startswith(word, 'A':'Z') || startswith(word, ' ')` - Inside the loop body, we check if the first character of the current word is either a capital letter or a space using the `startswith` function from Julia's Base library. The range `'A':'Z'` covers all capital letters.\n5. `push!(result, word)` - If the condition in the `if` statement is true, we add the current word to our `result` array using the `push!` method.\n6. `end` - The loop ends with the keyword `end`.\n7. `result` - Finally, we return the `result` array containing all the names that satisfy the condition.","status":200,"tokens":[372,429],"elapsed":15.399717042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
