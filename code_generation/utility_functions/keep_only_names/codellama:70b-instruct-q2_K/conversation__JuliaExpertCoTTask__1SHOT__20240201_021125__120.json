[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

Each word in the list is a string.\n\n**Solution**: Here's how I would solve it:\n\n1. Create an empty list called `result`. This will contain our final output.\n2. Loop through each word in the provided list of words (`words`).\n3. For each word, check if the first letter is uppercase by using the method `uppercase(word[1]) == word[1]`. If it's true, then add the word to the `result` list using `push!(result, word)`.\n4. After looping through all words, return the final result.\n\nHere's how the code would look like in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty list called 'result'. This will contain our final output.\n    result = []\n\n    # Loop through each word in the provided list of words ('words').\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first letter is uppercase by using the method 'uppercase(word[1]) == word[1]'. If it's true, then add the word to the result.\n        if uppercase(word[1]) == word[1]\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    # After looping through all words, return the final result.\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNow you can test this function by running it with different input lists of words:\n\n`keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])`","status":200,"tokens":[0,438],"elapsed":18.404941324,"_type":"aimessage"}]
