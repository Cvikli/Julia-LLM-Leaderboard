Inside the function, we create an empty list (`valid_names`) to store the capitalized names. We iterate through each word and check if its first character (index 1) is uppercase by using `isupper(i[1])`. If it is a valid name, we push it into our list of valid names with `push!(valid_names, i)`. Finally, after the iteration ends, we return the `valid_names` array.\n*   The code prints the final result as \"The names are: [Dog, Tiger]\" since cat is not a proper name due to it starting with a lowercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":16.592770216,"_type":"aimessage"}]
