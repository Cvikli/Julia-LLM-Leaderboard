[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is how you can write the function using Julia's built-in functions and features:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{String})\n    return filter(word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\n\nIn this solution, I used the `filter` function to iterate over each element in the provided list of words. This function takes a predicate (a boolean-valued function that returns true or false) and applies it to each element in the collection. The `word -> word[1] == uppercase(word[1])` part is a lambda function that checks if the first character of a word is equal to its capitalized form (i.e., an uppercase letter). If this condition is true, the word is kept; otherwise, it's discarded.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each string in the provided list contains at least one character. If empty strings can be present in the input list, you may want to add a check for that.","status":200,"tokens":[0,231],"elapsed":9.504981914,"_type":"aimessage"}]
