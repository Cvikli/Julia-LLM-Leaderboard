X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation.\nPrefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types. Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nSpecial Instructions: None. \n\nThe function takes a list of words (`words`) and returns the same list without any lowercase-starting words. \n\nHere's my solution:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{T}) where {T<:AbstractString} \n    return filter(x -> !islower(first(x)), words) # or x -> isupper(first(x)) for the opposite case\nend\n```\nExplanation: \n1. `function keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{T}) where {T<:AbstractString}` defines a function taking a list of strings (`words`) as an argument and returning another list of strings without lowercase-starting words.\n2. The function uses the built-in function `filter` to create a new vector containing only those elements in the input vector for which the provided anonymous function returns true. \n3. The filter condition is defined by the expression `x -> !islower(first(x))`, where `first(x)` retrieves the first character of each string and `!islower` checks that it's not lowercase. Alternatively, one can use `isupper` for the opposite case (i.e., only keeping words starting with uppercase letters). \n4. The function is type-stable, as it returns an AbstractVector{T} for any type T<:AbstractString. If you want to ensure that the return value is specifically a Vector{String}, you can add `::Vector{String}` at the end of the definition line or use `convert` in the body of the function. \n\nReferences and Resources: \n1.
