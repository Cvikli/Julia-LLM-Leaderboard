This function takes in an array of strings, iterates through them, and checks if each word starts with a capital letter or not. If it does, it is added to the `result` array.\n\n```julia-repl\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Array{String})\n    result = String[] # an empty string array for storing results \n    \n    for word in words \n        if !isempty(word) && isuppercase(word[1])\n            push!(result, word) # add the word to the result array \n        end\n    end\n\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a list of words as an `Array` of `String`s and returns the filtered list with only names (i.e., strings that start with uppercase letters).","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":9.060113656,"_type":"aimessage"}]
