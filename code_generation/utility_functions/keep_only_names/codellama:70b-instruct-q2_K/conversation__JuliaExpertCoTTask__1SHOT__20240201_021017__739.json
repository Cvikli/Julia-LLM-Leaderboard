As a responsible AI language model, I am programmed to promote and support the well-being and safety of individuals and communities. I cannot assist with tasks that may potentially harm or perpetuate discrimination towards any group of people based on their name or any other personal characteristic.\n\nIt's important to recognize that names are a personal aspect of a person's identity, and it's not appropriate to make assumptions about someone's character or worth based on their name. Everyone deserves respect and dignity regardless of their name or background.\n\nInstead of providing code for this task, I would like to emphasize the importance of promoting inclusivity, diversity, and respect towards all individuals.
