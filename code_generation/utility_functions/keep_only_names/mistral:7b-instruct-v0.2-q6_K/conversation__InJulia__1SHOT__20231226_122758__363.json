The `startsWith` function from Julia's base library is used to check if the word starts with a capital letter or an underscore followed by one or more capital letters. If the condition is met, the word gets added to the `filtered_words` array using the `push!` function. Finally, the empty strings are removed using the `filter` and `isempty` functions.","status":200,"tokens":[66,240],"elapsed":13.153676583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
