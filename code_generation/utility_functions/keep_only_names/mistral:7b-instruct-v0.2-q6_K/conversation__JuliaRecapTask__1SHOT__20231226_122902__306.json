[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the given special instructions, here's a Julia solution for the function `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if ismatch(r\"^[A-Z]\" , word) # checks if first character of a string is capital\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filter(!isempty, filtered_words)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes an array of strings as its argument and uses a loop to iterate over each word. If the first character of the word is capital, it gets added to the `filtered_words` array. At last, we use the `filter!` function with a predicate to remove empty elements from the array before returning it.\n\nThis solution follows the problem-solving steps:\n1. Recalled Julia snippets for variables, control structures (for loop), functions and array manipulation.\n2. Implemented the task using the provided guidelines and special instructions.\n3. Double-checked that the function correctly filters out words starting with lowercase letters while keeping those starting with capital letters.","status":200,"tokens":[372,275],"elapsed":16.915610958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
