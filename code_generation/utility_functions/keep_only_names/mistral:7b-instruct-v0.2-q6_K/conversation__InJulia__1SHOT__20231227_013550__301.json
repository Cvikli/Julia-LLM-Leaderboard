The function iterates through each word in the list using a `for` loop and checks whether it starts with a capital letter using the built-in `startswith()` function. If a word starts with a capital letter, it gets added to the `filtered_words` vector using the `pushfirst!()` method. Finally, any empty elements are removed from the vector using the `filter!()` method and the filtered list is returned as output.","status":200,"tokens":[66,238],"elapsed":13.060150959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
