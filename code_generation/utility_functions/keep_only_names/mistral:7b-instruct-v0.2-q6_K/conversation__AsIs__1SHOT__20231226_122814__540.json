If a word starts with a capital letter, it gets added to the resulting list; otherwise, it is skipped over. Finally, this function returns the new filtered list.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```python\nwords = ['cat', 'Dog', 'apple', 'dog', 'Banana']\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(filtered_words)  # Output: ['Dog', 'Banana']\n```","status":200,"tokens":[63,305],"elapsed":16.473762167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
