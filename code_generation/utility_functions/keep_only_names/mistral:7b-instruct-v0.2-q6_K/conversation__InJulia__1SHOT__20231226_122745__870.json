It creates an empty vector `filtered_words` to store the words that meet the condition and then iterates through each word in the input vector. The condition for a word to be kept is if its first character is a capital letter or if it starts with an underscore followed by a capital letter. The function uses the built-in `startswith()` function from Julia's base library to check whether a string starts with a given substring, and the `push!()` function to add elements to the end of a vector.","status":200,"tokens":[66,249],"elapsed":13.626274083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
