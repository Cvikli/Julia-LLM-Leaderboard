The `filtered` variable is then returned, which contains only the words that were kept.\n\nYou can test this function by calling it with a list of words as an argument:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Dog\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)  # Output: [\"Hello\", \"World\"]\n```\nThis will return the list of words that started with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[77,190],"elapsed":10.623196084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
