Here is a function `keep_only_names` that does just that:\n```\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    return [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The list comprehension iterates over the `words` list.\n* The filter function `if word[0].isupper()` checks whether the first character of each word is a capital letter. If it is, the word is kept in the list; otherwise, it is removed.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"CAt\"]\nkept_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(kept_names) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[52,197],"elapsed":6.498217291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
