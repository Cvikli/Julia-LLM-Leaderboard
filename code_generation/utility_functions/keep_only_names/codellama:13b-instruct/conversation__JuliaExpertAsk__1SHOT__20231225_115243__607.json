The `startswith` function is used to check if a word starts with a capital letter, and the `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of a word to uppercase.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Hello\", \"world\", \"dog\"]\n3-element Vector{String}:\n \"Hello\"\n \"world\"\n \"dog\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n2-element Vector{String}:\n \"Hello\"\n \"world\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[115,218],"elapsed":12.371555667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
