[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"function keep_only_names(words::Array{<:AbstractString, 1})\n    return [word for word in words if isupper(first(word))]\nend\n\nExplanation:\n\n* We define a function `keep_only_names` that takes an array of strings as input.\n* We use the `[...]` syntax to create a new list, where each element is determined by the expression inside the square brackets. In this case, we're using a comprehension (a type of syntactic sugar) to iterate over the elements of `words` and only keep those that start with an uppercase letter.\n* We use the `isupper` function from the `Unicode` module to check if the first character of each word is an uppercase letter. If it is, we include it in the new list; otherwise, we exclude it.\n\nNote: The `<:AbstractString` syntax means that the input array can contain any type of string (e.g., `String`, `SubString`, etc.), as long as it is a subtype of `AbstractString`. This allows us to write more general and flexible code that can handle different types of strings without having to specify exactly which ones we want to support.","status":200,"tokens":[380,265],"elapsed":17.486061458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
