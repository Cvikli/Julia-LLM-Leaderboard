Let's solve this problem using the approach you described.\n\nStep 1: Think through our approach step by step\n\n* We need to iterate over the list of words and check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n* If it doesn't, we should remove it from the list.\n\nStep 2: Write any functions and other code we need\n\n* Let's define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input and returns a new list with only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nStep 3: Solve the task\n\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    new_list = []\n    for word in words:\n        if word[0].isupper():\n            new_list.append(word)\n    return new_list\n\nStep 4: Check that our solution is correct\n\nlet's test the function with some examples:\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]) # [\"]\nkeep_only_names([\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\"]) # [Alice, Bob, Charlie]\nkeep_only_names([\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\"]) # [2, 3, 4]\n\nGreat!
