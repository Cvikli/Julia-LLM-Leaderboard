[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(word[1])]\nend\n```\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `words` vector and return only those elements that start with an uppercase letter. It does this by using the `isuppercase` function on the first character of each element in the vector, which returns `true` if it is an uppercase letter.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the `startswith` function to check if a string starts with a specific substring. Here's an example:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if startswith(word, uppercase)]\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `startswith` function to check if a string starts with an uppercase letter. If it does, it is included in the output vector.\n\nBoth of these functions should produce the desired output, but the first one is more concise and easier to read.","status":200,"tokens":[377,250],"elapsed":16.6927645,"_type":"aimessage"}]
