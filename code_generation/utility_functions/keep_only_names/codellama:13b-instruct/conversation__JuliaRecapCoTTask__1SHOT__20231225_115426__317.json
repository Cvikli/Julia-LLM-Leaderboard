[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    return [word for word in words if uppercase(word[1]) == word[1]]\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* We iterate over the `words` vector and use a list comprehension to create a new vector with only the words that start with a capital letter.\n* The `[word for word in words if uppercase(word[1]) == word[1]]` syntax is called a list comprehension, it allows us to filter and transform the elements of an iterable (in this case, `words`) into a new vector.\n* The `uppercase(word[1]) == word[1]` condition checks if the first character of each word is uppercase or not. If it's true, then we keep the word in the output vector, otherwise we discard it.\n* The `::Vector{String}` at the end of the function signature indicates that the return type is a vector of strings.\n\nNote: This solution uses the `uppercase` function from Julia's standard library to convert the first character of each word to uppercase. If you want to use a different method, for example, to check if a character is uppercase or not, you can replace the condition with your own implementation.","status":200,"tokens":[380,290],"elapsed":18.893751084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
