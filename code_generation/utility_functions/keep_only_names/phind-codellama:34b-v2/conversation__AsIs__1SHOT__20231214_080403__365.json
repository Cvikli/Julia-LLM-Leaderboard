Here is a function `keep_only_names` that does what you described:\n\n```\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    new_list = []\n    for word in words:\n        if word[0].isupper():\n            new_list.append(word)\n    return new_list\n```\n\nLet me explain how the function works:\n\n1. `new_list = []`: We create an empty list to store the modified words.\n2. `for word in words`: We iterate over the original list of words using a `for` loop.\n3. `if word[0].isupper():`: We check if the first character of the current word is a capital letter. If it is, we append the word to the `new_list`.\n4. `new_list.append(word)`: We add the word to the modified list.\n5. `return new_list`: We return the modified list of words that only contain names that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can test the function by calling it with a list of words, like this:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"house\", \"House\"]\nnew_list = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(new_list)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"House\"]\n```\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[52,310],"elapsed":10.224008625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
