This function allows you to remove elements from an array based on a condition. The condition here is that a word starts with a capital letter.\n\nHere is an example implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filter!(word -> isuppercase(first(word)), words)\nend\n\n# Helper function to check if the first character of a string is uppercase.\nisuppercase(c::Char) = c == uppercase(c)\n```\nThis `keep_only_names` function accepts a vector of strings (`words`) as input, and modifies it in-place by using `filter!`. The condition for keeping a word is that the first character of the word (`first(word)`) is an uppercase letter (`isuppercase(first(word))`).\n\nYou can call this function with a vector of strings like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\", \"fish\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\nprintln(words)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, \"Dog\" and \"Bird\" are the words that start with a capital letter, so those are the only ones left in the `words` vector after calling `keep_only_names`.","status":200,"tokens":[80,325],"elapsed":41.704625625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
