X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started on solving the task at hand using the Julia language.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Iterating over a list of words using `for` loop\n\t* Checking if a string starts with a capital letter using `isupper` function\n\t* Removing an element from a list using `filter` function\n2. Solve the task:\n\tCreate a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words as input and returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter. Here's one way to solve this problem:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isupper(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\tVerify that the function returns the expected output for different inputs. For example, if we call `keep_only_names` with the list `[ \"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cats\" ]`, it should return `[\"Dog\", \"Cats\"]`.\n\nAnd here's the complete code:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> isupper(word[1]), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n\n# Test the function with different inputs\nwords = [ \"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cats\" ]\nprintln(keep_only_names(words)) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Cats\"]\n```\nBy following these steps, we can write a correct and efficient function using Julia programming language.","status":200,"tokens":[369,380],"elapsed":16.85924525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
