The function does this by iterating over each word in the input vector, checking if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `isuppercase` function, and adding the word to a new vector if it passes this test. The function then returns the new vector.","status":200,"tokens":[209,256],"elapsed":57.83738275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
