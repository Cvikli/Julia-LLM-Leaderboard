The `filter!` function then iterates over each word in the array and removes it if the first character of that word does not satisfy the condition specified by the `isuppercase` function, i.e., if it is not an uppercase letter.\n\nHere's a brief demonstration of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fan\", \"Goat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\nprintln(words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Goat\"]\n```\n\nIn this example, the words \"cat\" and \"fan\" are removed from the `words` array because they do not start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[80,267],"elapsed":34.556713083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
