It checks whether the first character of `word` (`first(word)`) is uppercase (`isuppercase(...)`). If it is, that `word` is included in the returned list. Otherwise, it's excluded. As a result, the function returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter. \n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"apple\", \"Ball\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words) # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Ball\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[80,223],"elapsed":29.399134666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
