In this case, the condition is that the first character of each word should be an uppercase letter and the last character should not be a lowercase letter (to exclude words like \"Dog.\"). The helper functions `isuppercase` and `islowercase` are used to check if a character is an uppercase or lowercase letter, respectively. \n\nHere's how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"Fish.\", \"Goat\", \"ant\", \"Bear\", \"donkey\", \"Emu?\", \"Fox\", \"hamster\"]\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(filtered_words)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Goat\", \"Bear\", \"Emu?\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[119,333],"elapsed":43.825725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
