List comprehension is a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. You can apply a condition to the list, like removing all words that do not start with a capital letter.\n\nHere's how you could implement `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercase(first(word))]\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, list comprehension is used to create a new list containing only the words from the input `words` that satisfy the condition `isuppercase(first(word))`. This condition checks whether the first letter of a word is uppercase. If it is, the word is included in the new list. Otherwise, the word is not included.\n\nFor example, when you call `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])`, it will return `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]` because those are the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[209,244],"elapsed":34.570459542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
