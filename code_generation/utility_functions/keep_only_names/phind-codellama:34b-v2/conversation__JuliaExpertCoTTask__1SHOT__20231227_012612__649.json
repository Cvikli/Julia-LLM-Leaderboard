[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can create a function `keep_only_names` that uses list comprehension to keep only the words which start with a capital letter. Here is an example implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    return [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\n\nprint(keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]))\n```\n\nThe `isupper()` function checks whether the first character of each word is a capital letter. The list comprehension then only keeps the words where this condition is true. \n\nWhen you run this code with the input `[\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]`, it will print: `['Apple', 'Carrot']`. As you can see, \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\" are the only words that start with a capital letter, so these are the ones kept in the list.","status":200,"tokens":[209,210],"elapsed":51.214062958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
