[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can achieve this task by iterating over the list of words, checking if each word starts with a capital letter and then appending it to a new list. In Julia, strings can be indexed, so you can check the first character of a string at index 1. Here is how you could implement `keep_only_names`:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})::Vector{String}\n    names = String[] # create an empty array for storing names\n\n    for word in words\n        if isuppercase(word[1])  # checks if the first character of word is uppercase\n            push!(names, word)  # appends the name to the names list\n        end\n    end\n\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThe `isuppercase` function checks if a character is uppercase. If you want to check for any unicode uppercase letter, you could use `isupper(word[1])` from Base Unicode.\n\nYou can call this function with a list of words like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"fish\", \"Giraffe\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]\n```\n\nThis will print `[\"Dog\", \"Elephant\", \"Giraffe\"]`, as these are the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[383,333],"elapsed":49.892221458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
