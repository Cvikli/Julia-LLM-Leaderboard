[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple function to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\nwords = upperfilter(words, true) # Filter words that start with a capital letter\n\nreturn words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `upperfilter` function from the standard Julia library to filter out words that don't start with a capital letter. The `true` argument passed to `upperfilter` ensures that only words starting with a capital letter are kept in the result list. \n\nYou can test this function using:\n\n```julia\n@assert(keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Lion\", \"Elephant\"]))\n```\n\nThis statement should pass if the function works as expected, meaning it correctly filters out words that don't start with a capital letter. \n\nPlease note that Julia is case sensitive and doesn't have a built-in function to check if a string starts with a capital letter like some other languages (e.g., Python). The `upperfilter` function above works by converting the first character of each word to uppercase, effectively discarding words that don't start with a capital letter according to Julia's rules.","status":200,"tokens":[362,257],"elapsed":5.770676292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
