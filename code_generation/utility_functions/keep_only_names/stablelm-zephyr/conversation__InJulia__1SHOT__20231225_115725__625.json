I'll explain the `starts_with` function below. Slightly simplified, this function would return a new array containing only the words that start with a capital letter (i.e., \"Dog\", \"Igor\", etc.).\n\nThe main function `keep_only_names` takes a list of strings (`words`) as input and returns a set of strings (implemented as an ordered collection). This is useful because sets automatically remove duplicates, so you won't end up with the same word appearing multiple times in the output.\n\nHere's how you might use this function:\n```julia\nnames = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Igor\", \"Lion\", \"dOG\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(names)\nprintln(List(\"*\")(filtered_names))\n# Output: [\"Dog\", \"Igor\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[75,291],"elapsed":5.112454083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
