[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words: Array[String])\nfor i, word in enumerate(words)\nif islower(word[1]) && first(word) != toupper(word[0])\nwords[i] = \"\"\nend\nend\nreturn words\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of `words` as input.\n- We iterate over the list using a `for` loop and an index variable `i`.\n- Within each iteration, we check if the second character (`word[1]`) is lowercase and the first character (`word[0]`) isn't uppercase.\n- If this condition is true, it means that the word doesn't start with a capital letter (lowercase after an uppercase). In such cases, we remove the word by assigning an empty string to the corresponding index in the `words` list.\n- Finally, we return the updated list of words without any lowercase words that don't start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[362,233],"elapsed":5.300938417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
