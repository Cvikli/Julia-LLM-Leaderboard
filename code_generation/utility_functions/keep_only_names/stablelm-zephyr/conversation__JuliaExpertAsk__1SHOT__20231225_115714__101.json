The function `keep_only_names` is defined with a type parameter `T`, which represents the type of elements in the input list `words`. We have specified that this function works only on vectors of any abstract data type (`where T : AbstractDataType`).\n2. Inside the function, we use the `match` method to check if each word starts with a capital letter or not. The regular expression pattern `r\"^\\w+|[A-Z][a-z]*$\"` matches words that start only with one or more alphanumeric characters (`\\w+`) or follow by an uppercase letter (`[A-Z]`), with optional lowercase letters after it (`[a-z]*`).\n3. We return a new vector containing the filtered words using the `[]` index operator and the result of each word match operation. The expression `words[word.match(r\"^\\w+|[A-Z][a-z]*$\")]` selects the elements from the original list based on their matching to the regular expression pattern.\n4. To test this function, you can use:\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\"];\n(Dog, Elephant)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,340],"elapsed":6.074263958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
