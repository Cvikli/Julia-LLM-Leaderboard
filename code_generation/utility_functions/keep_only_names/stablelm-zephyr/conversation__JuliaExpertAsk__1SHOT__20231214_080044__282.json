Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nkeep_only_names(words) = [word for word in words if first(word) == uppercase(word[1])]\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `first` function extracts the first character of each word in the input list.\n* The `uppercase` function converts the first character of each word to uppercase.\n* The `[]` operator filters out the words that do not start with an uppercase character.\n\nFor example, if we call `keep_only_names` with the input list `[ \"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Capital\" ]`, it will return `[ \"Dog\", \"Capital\" ]`.","status":200,"tokens":[98,172],"elapsed":6.170262083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
