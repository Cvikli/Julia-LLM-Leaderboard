When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the solution in Python, as requested:\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\nreturn [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\n\ndata = [\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(data)\nprint(result)# Output: ['Apple', 'Carrot']\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe function `keep_only_names` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each word in the provided list. It keeps only those words whose first character (accessed using `word[0]`) is an uppercase letter. The result is a new list containing only the desired words. In this case, it removes \"dog\" while keeping \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\".","status":200,"tokens":[197,173],"elapsed":6.110637084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
