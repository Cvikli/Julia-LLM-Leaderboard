Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n\n```\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    filtered_list = []\n    for word in words:\n        if word.istartwith(word. upper()):\n            filtered_list.append(word)\n    return filtered_list\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes a list of words as input (`words`) and returns a new list with only the words that start with a capital letter.\n* We use a list comprehension to create the new list.\n* Inside the list comprehension, we check if the current word starts with a capital letter by using the `istartwith` method. If it does, we append the word to the filtered list.\n* Finally, we return the filtered list.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"house\", \"House\"]\nfiltered_list = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(filtered_list) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"House\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[52,251],"elapsed":8.248421458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
