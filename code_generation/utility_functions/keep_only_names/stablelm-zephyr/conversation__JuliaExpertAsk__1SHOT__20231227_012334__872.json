This returns an iterator yielding each word as a sequence of characters (a string). We use the `push!(tuple, word)` operation to add only those words that start with a capital letter back into the tuple (since we're interested in keeping only names starting with capital letters).\n- Finally, we return the modified list of words (`@words...`) without any non-capital-starting words.","status":200,"tokens":[112,267],"elapsed":4.828182542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
