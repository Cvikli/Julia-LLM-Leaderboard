[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Define a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of words (`words`) as input.\n2. Iterate over the list of words using a for loop.\n3. For each word, check if it starts with a capital letter using the `isupper` function from the `string` module.\n4. If the word does not start with a capital letter, remove it from the list using the `pop` method.\n5. Return the modified list.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    for i in 1:length(words)\n        if !isupper(words[i])\n            pop!(words, i)\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\nNote that this function modifies the original list of words and returns a new list with only the names that start with a capital letter. If you want to keep the original list unchanged, you can create a copy of it before iterating over it:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    new_words = deepcopy(words)\n    for i in 1:length(new_words)\n        if !isupper(new_words[i])\n            pop!(new_words, i)\n        end\n    end\n    return new_words\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,317],"elapsed":2.660007267,"_type":"aimessage"}]
