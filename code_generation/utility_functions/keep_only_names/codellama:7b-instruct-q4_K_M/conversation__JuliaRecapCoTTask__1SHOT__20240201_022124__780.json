[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nHere is a possible solution to the problem:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if !(word[1] == ' ') && (word[1] == uppercase(word[1]))\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\nThis solution uses a for loop to iterate over the list of words. For each word, it checks whether the first character is a capital letter using `uppercase` and appends the word to the result if it meets the condition. The result is returned at the end.\n\nIt's important to note that this function assumes that all the words in the input list are strings. If they are not, you may need to modify the code accordingly. Additionally, this solution uses a simple approach to check if a word starts with a capital letter, which may not be sufficient for all cases. If you need a more robust solution, you may want to consider using a regular expression or other more advanced string manipulation techniques.","status":200,"tokens":[0,236],"elapsed":1.969680119,"_type":"aimessage"}]
