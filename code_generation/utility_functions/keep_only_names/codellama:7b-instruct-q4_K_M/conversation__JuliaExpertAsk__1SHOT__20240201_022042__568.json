The `isuppercasefirst` function checks if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n\nAlternatively, you could use a more concise approach using a comprehension:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return [word for word in words if isuppercasefirst(word)]\nend\n```\nThis will create a new array with only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,175],"elapsed":1.446065137,"_type":"aimessage"}]
