[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution:\n```scss\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Iterate over the list of words and check if each word starts with a capital letter.\n    for word in words\n        if !startswith(word, uppercase(word))\n            # If the word does not start with a capital letter, remove it from the list.\n            deleteat!(words, findfirst(==(word), words))\n        end\n    end\n    return words\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `startswith` function to check if each word starts with a capital letter, and if not, removes it from the list using the `deleteat!` function. The `findfirst` function is used to find the index of the word in the list that needs to be removed, and then the `deleteat!` function is called with the index as an argument.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the words are stored in a list, which can be passed as an argument to the `keep_only_names` function. If the words are stored in a different data structure, such as a string or an array, the appropriate data structure will need to be used instead. Additionally, if the words are not stored in a list, but rather in some other data structure, such as a dictionary or a set, the appropriate data structure will also need to be used instead.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.523737277,"_type":"aimessage"}]
