[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(word -> isuppercasefirst(word), words)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `filter` function takes a predicate (in this case, a function that checks if the word starts with an uppercase letter) and an iterable (in this case, a list of words). It returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate is true.\n* The `isuppercasefirst` function checks if the first character of a string is an uppercase letter.\n* The `->` operator is used to define a lambda function, which is an anonymous function that takes no arguments and returns a value based on its implementation. In this case, it checks if the word starts with an uppercase letter and returns true or false accordingly.\n* The `:` operator is used to create a range of indices, in this case from 1 to the length of the list of words. This allows us to iterate over each element in the list using a for loop.\n* The `for` loop iterates over each word in the list and checks if it starts with an uppercase letter using the `isuppercasefirst` function. If it does, it adds it to the new list of names.\n* The `return` statement is used to return the new list of names.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input list of words is a list of strings. If the input list contains other types of data (e.g., numbers), you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":2.994556003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
