[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    names = []\n    for word in words\n        if first(word) == 'A' || first(word) == 'a'\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the input list `words`. For each element, it checks if the first character is uppercase or lowercase using the `first(word)` function. If the first character is uppercase, the word is added to the output list `names` using the `push!` function. The resulting `names` list is then returned by the function.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all words in the input list are strings and that the first letter of each string represents a single word. If this assumption is not valid, the function may need to be modified to handle other cases, such as when the input list contains substrings or whitespace characters.","status":200,"tokens":[0,232],"elapsed":2.013502388,"_type":"aimessage"}]
