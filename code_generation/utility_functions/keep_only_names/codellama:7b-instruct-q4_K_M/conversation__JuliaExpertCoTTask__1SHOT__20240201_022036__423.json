The function `keep_only_names` takes a list of words as input, `words`.\n2. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the words and check if they start with a capital letter. If the word starts with a capital letter, it is included in the new list. If not, it is discarded.\n3. The function returns the new list of words that start with a capital letter.\n4. The print statement is used to display the output of the function.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that all words are given in lowercase and will be processed as such. If any word is not in lowercase, it may not be properly identified as starting with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,220],"elapsed":1.826589906,"_type":"aimessage"}]
