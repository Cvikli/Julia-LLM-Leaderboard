[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> first(x) == 'D', words)\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses the `filter` function to iterate over the list of words and remove all words that do not start with a capital letter. The `first` function is used to get the first character of each word, which is then compared to the letter \"D\" using the `==` operator. If the first letter is not \"D\", the word is removed from the resulting list.\n\nIt's worth noting that this implementation assumes that all words in the list are strings, and that the function should only return words that start with a capital letter. If there are other requirements or assumptions that need to be made, such as handling non-string inputs or returning a different data structure (e.g., an array of strings instead of a list), additional code may be needed to handle those cases.","status":200,"tokens":[0,222],"elapsed":1.930917492,"_type":"aimessage"}]
