Here is an example of how you could write a function in Julia to keep only names that start with a capital letter:\n```\n# Function to keep only names that start with a capital letter\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])\n            return word\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Capital\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) # [ \"Dog\", \"Capital\" ]\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `for` loop iterates over the list of words.\n* Inside the loop, we check if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `uppercase` function.\n* If the first character is uppercase, we return the word.\n* If the word does not start with an uppercase letter, the loop continues to the next word.\n\nNote that this function will only remove words that do not start with a capital letter, it will not remove any other type of word.","status":200,"tokens":[69,241],"elapsed":7.973428709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
