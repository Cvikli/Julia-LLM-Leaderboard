Here's an example of how you could write a function in Julia to keep only the names that start with a capital letter:\n\n```\n# Define a function to keep only names that start with a capital letter\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}()\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] == Uppercase(word[1])\n            push! filtered_words, word\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use a vector `words` as input and iterate over each element using a for loop. We check if the first character of each word is uppercase by using the `Uppercase` function, which converts a string to an uppercase version of itself. If the first character is uppercase, we push the word onto a new vector `filtered_words`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n```\n# Test the function with some input words\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Capital\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(\"Filtered names: \")\nprintln(filtered_names)\n```\nThe output of this code will be:\n```\nFiltered names: [\"Dog\", \"Capital\"]\n```\nAs expected, the function has removed the words \"dog\" and \"cat\" since they do not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[69,331],"elapsed":11.020926916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
