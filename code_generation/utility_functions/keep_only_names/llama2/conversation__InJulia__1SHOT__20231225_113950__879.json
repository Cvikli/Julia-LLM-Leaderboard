Here's an example function in Julia that does what you described:\n```\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filtered_words = Vector{String}()\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z'\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes a list of strings `words` as input.\n* We use a loop to iterate over the words in the list.\n* Inside the loop, we check if the first character of each word is a capital letter (using the `>=` and `<=` operators to compare the character with the range of uppercase letters). If it is, we push the word onto a new list called `filtered_words`.\n* Once we've processed all the words in the original list, we return the list of only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can test the function like this:\n```\njulia> words = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Capital\", \"lowercase\"]\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n[\"Dog\", \"Capital\"]\n```\nNote that we're using a vector `Vector{String}` to store the words, and we're using the `push!` method to add new elements to it. You can also use a list `List` instead of a vector if you prefer.","status":200,"tokens":[1,341],"elapsed":10.80636725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
