X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, let's get started! Based on the problem statement and special instructions provided, I will follow these steps to write a function `keep_only_names` in Julia:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Iterating over a list with `for` loop\n\t* Checking if a string starts with a capital letter using the `startswith` method\n\t* Creating a new list by filtering out unwanted elements\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Create a function `keep_only_names` that takes a list of strings `words` as input\n\t* Iterate over the list of words using a `for` loop\n\t* Check if each word starts with a capital letter using the `startswith` method\n\t* If the word does not start with a capital letter, remove it from the list and create a new list of only the remaining words\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the function correctly removes all words that do not start with a capital letter from the input list\n\t* Test the function with different input lists to ensure it works as expected\n\nHere's the implemented `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractString)\n    # Create a new list to store only the names that start with capital letters\n    keep_list = Vector{AbstractString}()\n\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, \" Capital\")\n            push!(keep_list, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return keep_list\nend\n```\nIn this implementation, we first create a new list `keep_list` to store only the names that start with capital letters. We then iterate over the input list of strings using a `for` loop, and for each word, we check if it starts with the string \" Capital\" (i.e., any string that starts with a capital letter). If it does, we push the word onto the `keep_list`. Otherwise, we skip the word.\n\nSpecial Instructions:\nPlease provide the list of words you would like me to keep only the names for.\n```\n# Example input: [\"hello\", \"world\", \"Dog\", \"capital\", \"name\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[11,506],"elapsed":18.31490275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
