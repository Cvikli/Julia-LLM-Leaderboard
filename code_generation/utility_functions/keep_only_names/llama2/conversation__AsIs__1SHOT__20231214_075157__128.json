Here is a function in Python that does what you described:\n```\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    new_list = []\n    for word in words:\n        if word.istartwith(word[0].upper()):\n            new_list.append(word)\n    return new_list\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. `for word in words`: This line loops over the list of words you provide.\n2. `if word.istartwith(word[0].upper()):`: This line checks if the current word starts with a capital letter (i.e., the first character of the word is an uppercase letter). If it does, then...\n3. `new_list.append(word)`: ...the function adds the word to a new list called `new_list`.\n4. `return new_list`: The function returns the `new_list` at the end of the loop.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"Doggy\", \"Kitty\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) # [Dog, Cat]\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[52,279],"elapsed":9.200861375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
