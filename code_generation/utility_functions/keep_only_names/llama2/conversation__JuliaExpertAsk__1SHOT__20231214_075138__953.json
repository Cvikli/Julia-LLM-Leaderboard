Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nkeep_only_names(words) = filter(word -> startswith(word, uppercase), words)\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `filter` function is used to create a new list where each element is the result of applying a function to the corresponding element in the original list.\n* The `startswith` function is used to check if the first character of the word is uppercase.\n* The `uppercase` argument is set to `true` to indicate that only words starting with an uppercase letter should be included in the result.\n\nFor example, if we call `keep_only_names` on the list `[ \"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"mouse\" ]`, it will return `[\"Dog\", \"mouse\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[98,190],"elapsed":6.774549667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
