Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nkeep_only_names(words) = filter(word -> startswith(word, capitalize(word)), words)\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `filter()` is a built-in function in Julia that applies a function to each element of a list and returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy the function.\n* `startswith()` is a function in Julia that checks whether a string starts with another string. We use it here to check whether each word in the original list starts with a capitalized version of itself.\n* `capitalize(word)` returns the word with the first letter capitalized, using the `capitalize` function from the `String` type.\n\nExample usage:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Dog\", \"Feline\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) --> [\"Dog\", \"Feline\"]\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[1,235],"elapsed":7.453681916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
