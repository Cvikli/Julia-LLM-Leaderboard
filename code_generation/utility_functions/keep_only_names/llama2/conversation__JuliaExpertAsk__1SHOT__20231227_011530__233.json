Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nkeep_only_names(words) = [word for word in words if first(word) != lowercase(\"\")]\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `first` function returns the first character of a string.\n* The `lowercase` function converts a string to lowercase.\n* The `[word for word in words if first(word) != lowercase(\"\"]]` syntax creates a list comprehension that iterates over the `words` list and filters out any words that do not start with a capital letter. The `if` statement checks whether the first character of each word is not equal to an empty string (i.e., a lowercase letter). If it is, then the word is included in the resulting list.\n\nFor example, if `words` is the list `[ \"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\" ]`, then `keep_only_names(words)` will return the list `[ \"Dog\" ]`.","status":200,"tokens":[98,225],"elapsed":7.76224725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
