[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"Write a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a function `keep_only_names` that does as you described:\n\n```\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    filtered_list = []\n    for word in words:\n        if word[0].isupper():\n            filtered_list.append(word)\n    return filtered_list\n```\n\nTo explain how this function works:\n\n* The function takes a list of words as input (`words`).\n* It creates a new list (`filtered_list`) that will hold the names in the original list.\n* It iterates over each word in the original list using a for loop (`for word in words`).\n* Inside the loop, it checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter (`if word[0].isupper()`).\n* If the first character is uppercase, the function appends the word to the `filtered_list` (`filtered_list.append(word)`).\n* The function returns the `filtered_list` at the end (`return filtered_list`).\n\nYou can test this function with a list of words, like this:\n\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Capital\"]\nfiltered_names = keep_only_names(words)\nprint(filtered_names)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Capital\"]\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[1,319],"elapsed":10.075531541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
