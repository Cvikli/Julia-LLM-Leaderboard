The `istitle()` method checks if the whole word is title-cased, which includes the first letter being capitalized. If the word does not have a title case, the `capitalize()` method is used to check if capitalizing the first letter makes the word equal to its original form. If so, it is kept in the new list.","status":200,"tokens":[65,217],"elapsed":2.337935125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
