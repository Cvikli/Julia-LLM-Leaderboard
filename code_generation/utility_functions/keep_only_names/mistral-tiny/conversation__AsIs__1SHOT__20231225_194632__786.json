The list comprehension iterates over each word in the `words` list and checks if the word is a title (starts with multiple capital letters) or if it's just capitalized using the built-in `istitle()` and `iscapitalized()` methods. If the condition is met, the word is added to the new list. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_words` list.","status":200,"tokens":[65,363],"elapsed":3.2040265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
