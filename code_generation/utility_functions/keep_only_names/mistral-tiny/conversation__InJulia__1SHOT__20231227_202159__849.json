It defines a function named `keep_only_names` that takes an abstract vector of strings as an argument.\n2. An empty vector `result` is created to store the words that will be kept.\n3. A `for` loop iterates through all the words in the input vector called `words`.\n4. The `startswith` function checks if the word starts with a capital letter or an empty string.\n   - If it is the case, the word is added to the beginning of the vector `result` using the `pushfirst!` function.\n5. Once the loop is done, the function returns the resulting vector `result`.","status":200,"tokens":[68,258],"elapsed":2.641789541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
