[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the given special instructions, here's the solution using the Julia language:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if isletter(first(word)) && isupper(first(word))\n            pushfirst!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. First, we define a function named `keep_only_names` with a single argument `words` which is an abstract array of abstract strings.\n2. Inside the function, we initialize an empty array `filtered_words` to store the words that will meet our requirement.\n3. We use a `for` loop to iterate through each `word` in the `words` array.\n4. Inside the loop, we use the `isletter` and `isupper` functions from the standard library to check if the first character of a word is both a letter and uppercase.\n5. If this condition is true, we use the `pushfirst!` function to add the word to the beginning of the `filtered_words` array.\n6. After the loop finishes, the function returns the `filtered_words` array.\n\nThis solution should correctly keep only the words that start with a capital letter in the given list of words.","status":200,"tokens":[373,316],"elapsed":2.831578042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
