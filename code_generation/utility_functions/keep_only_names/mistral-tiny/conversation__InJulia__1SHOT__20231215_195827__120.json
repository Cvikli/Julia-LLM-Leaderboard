It then iterates over each word in the input vector using a `for` loop. For each word, it checks if the first character is a capital letter or a space using the `startswith` function. If the condition is met, the word is added to the `filtered_words` vector using the `pushfirst!` function. Finally, the function returns the `filtered_words` vector.","status":200,"tokens":[68,222],"elapsed":1.887418,"_type":"aimessage"}]
