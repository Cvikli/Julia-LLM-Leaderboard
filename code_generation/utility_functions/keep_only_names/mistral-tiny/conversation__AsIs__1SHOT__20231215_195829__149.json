The `istitle()` method checks if a word is a title (i.e., it has a capitalized first and all subsequent words have their first letter capitalized), and the `iscapitalized()` method checks if the first letter of a word is capitalized.","status":200,"tokens":[65,234],"elapsed":1.99915475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
