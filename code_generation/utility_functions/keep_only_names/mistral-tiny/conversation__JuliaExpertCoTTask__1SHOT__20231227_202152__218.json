Think through the approach:\n   - Iterate through each word in the list\n   - Check if the first character of each word is a capital letter using the first index `[1]` and the `isletter` function from the `Char` module\n   - If the condition is true, keep the word, otherwise discard it\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{String})\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if isletter(words[1][1])\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3.
