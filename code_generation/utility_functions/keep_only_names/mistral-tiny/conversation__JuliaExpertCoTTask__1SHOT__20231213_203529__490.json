Think through the approach: We need to iterate over the list of words, and for each word, check if its first letter is capital. If it is, keep the word; if not, discard it.\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractVector{String})\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if isfirstletter(uppercasefirst(word), word)\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task: The function iterates over the provided list of words, checks if the first letter of each word is capital, and keeps the word in a new list if it is.\n\n4.
