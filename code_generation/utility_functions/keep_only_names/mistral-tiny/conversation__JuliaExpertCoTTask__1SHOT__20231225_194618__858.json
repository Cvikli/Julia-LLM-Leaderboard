Think through my approach step by step:\n   - Iterate through each word in the given list.\n   - Check if the word's first character is a capital letter using the `startswith` function.\n   - If the word starts with a capital letter, keep it in the new list. Otherwise, remove it.\n\n2. Write the function:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, 'A':'Z') || startswith(word, '_') || startswith(word, '\\')\n            pushfirst!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3.
