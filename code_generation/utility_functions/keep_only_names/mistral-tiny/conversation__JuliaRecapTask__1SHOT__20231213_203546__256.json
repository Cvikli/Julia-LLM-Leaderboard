[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the given special instructions, here's how I would approach this task using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Control structures: `if-elseif-else`\n   - String manipulation: `isletter(c)`, `isfirst(c, s)`, `capitalize(s)`\n   - List processing: `filter(p, xs)`\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n  keep_words = filter(!isfirst(islower, first), words)\n  capitalized_words = map(capitalize, keep_words)\n  return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThis function first filters out words with their first character not being a capital letter using the `filter` function with a predicate function `!isfirst(islower, first)`. After filtering, the remaining words are capitalized using the `map` function with the `capitalize` function. This should result in a list of words where the first character is capital, as requested.\n\nIn summary, the `keep_only_names` function takes a list of words as its argument and returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[373,306],"elapsed":5.628526584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
