Here's a simple implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    names = String[]\n    for word in words\n        if iscapitalized(word)\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return names\nend\n```\n\nThis function creates a new array `names` to store the words that start with a capital letter. It then iterates over each word in the `words` array using a `for` loop. If the current word is capitalized (which you can check in Julia using the `iscapitalized` function), it adds the word to the `names` array using the `push!` function. Finally, the function returns the `names` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[68,199],"elapsed":2.765819292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
