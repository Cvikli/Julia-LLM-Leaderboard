If the first character of the word is a capital letter (i.e., its ASCII code is between 'A' and 'Z'), the word is added to the `names` list. Finally, the function returns the `names` list containing only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"Elephant\"]\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n2-element Vector{String}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"Elephant\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the input list `words` contains six words, and the `keep_only_names` function returns a new list containing only the words that start with a capital letter (\"Dog\", \"Cat\", and \"Elephant\").","status":200,"tokens":[68,330],"elapsed":12.643574666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
