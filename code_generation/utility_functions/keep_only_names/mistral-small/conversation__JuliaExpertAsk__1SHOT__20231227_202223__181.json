The `startswith` function checks whether a given word starts with the specified character, and we use the dot syntax to broadcast this function over all elements of `words`. Since `uppercase` returns a single character in uppercase, only words starting with a capital letter will pass the `startswith` test.","status":200,"tokens":[109,146],"elapsed":2.292160583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
