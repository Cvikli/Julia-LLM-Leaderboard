Instead, we can use a more concise approach by checking if the first character of the word is a letter using the `isletter` function and then checking if it is uppercase using the `uppercase` function:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filter(word -> isletter(word[1]) && isupper(word[1]), words)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a collection of strings `words` as input and returns a new collection that includes only the words that start with a capital letter. The `filter` function takes a predicate function as its first argument and applies it to each element of the input collection, returning a new collection that includes only the elements for which the predicate returns `true`. In this case, the predicate function checks if the first character of the word is a letter and if it is uppercase.","status":200,"tokens":[109,313],"elapsed":4.262253459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
