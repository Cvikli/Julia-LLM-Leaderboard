It takes a single argument `word`, and returns `true` if the word starts with a capital letter (i.e., if the first character of the word is equal to the uppercase version of itself).\n* The collection we're filtering is `words`, which is the first argument passed to the `keep_only_names` function.\n* Finally, we use the `return` statement to return the filtered collection.\n\nNote that this function modifies the original collection in place, and also returns the modified collection. This is why we use `filter!` instead of `filter`, which would create a new collection and leave the original unmodified. If you want to keep the original collection unmodified, you can use `filter` instead of `filter!`, but then you'll need to assign the result to a new variable. For example:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = filter(word -> startswith(word, uppercase(word[1])), words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nIn this version of the function, we use `filter` instead of `filter!`, and assign the result to a new variable `filtered_words`. We then return this new variable. Note that the original `words` collection is unmodified.","status":200,"tokens":[109,431],"elapsed":5.753667792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
