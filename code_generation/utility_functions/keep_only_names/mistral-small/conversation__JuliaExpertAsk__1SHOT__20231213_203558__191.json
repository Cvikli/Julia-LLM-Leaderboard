The `startswith` function checks if a word starts with a specific character or substring, and `uppercase` is used to ensure that the comparison is case-sensitive. The first character of each word is passed to `uppercase` to get the corresponding uppercase character, and this is compared to the first character of the word using `startswith`.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n```julia\njulia> words = [\"Dog\", \"dog\", \"Cat\", \"cat\", \"Elephant\", \"elephant\"]\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"Elephant\"\n```\nI hope that helps!
