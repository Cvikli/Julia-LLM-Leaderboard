The function uses the `filter!` function to iterate over the input words and keep only those that start with a capital letter:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter!(word -> startswith(word, 'A') || startswith(word, 'B') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'C') || startswith(word, 'D') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'E') || startswith(word, 'F') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'G') || startswith(word, 'H') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'I') || startswith(word, 'J') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'K') || startswith(word, 'L') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'M') || startswith(word, 'N') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'O') || startswith(word, 'P') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'Q') || startswith(word, 'R') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'S') || startswith(word, 'T') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'U') || startswith(word, 'V') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'W') || startswith(word, 'X') ||\n                        startswith(word, 'Y') || startswith(word, 'Z'),\n                    words)\nend\n```\n\nThe `startswith(word, 'A')` expression checks if the word begins with the letter A (or any capital letter). The `filter!` function applies this test to each word in the input collection and returns a new collection containing only the elements for which the function returns `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[68,439],"elapsed":6.434597458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
