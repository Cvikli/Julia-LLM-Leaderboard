It uses the `isupper()` string method to check if the first character of each word is a capital letter. If the condition `word[0].isupper()` is true, then the word is kept in the new list; otherwise, it is discarded. The resulting list contains only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[65,142],"elapsed":2.452313167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
