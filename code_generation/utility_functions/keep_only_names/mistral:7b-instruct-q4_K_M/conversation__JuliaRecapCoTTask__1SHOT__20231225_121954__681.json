[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered = filter!(iscaped)(words)\n    return filter(x -> x[1] == uppercase(first(x))), filtered\nend\n\ntest_list = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"CAT\"]\n\nprintln(\"Original list: \", test_list)\nprintln(\"Filtered (capitalized): \", keep_only_names(test_list))\nprintln(\"Filtered (starting with capital letter): \", keep_only_names(test_list)[1])\n```\n\n# Explanation:\nThe task requires filtering words in the `words` list based on two conditions - (a) if the word starts with a capital letter, and (b) if the entire word is capitalized.\n\nFirst, we use the built-in `filter!` function to remove any words that do not start with an uppercase character (condition (a)). This returns a new array without the unwanted elements.\n\nThen, we apply another filter using anonymous functions to keep only those words which have their first letter capitalized (condition (b)). We achieve this by calling `filter(x -> x[1] == uppercase(first(x)))` on the filtered list.\n\nFinally, we return the original filtered list along with the additional condition applied at the end.","status":200,"tokens":[375,306],"elapsed":14.041875541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
