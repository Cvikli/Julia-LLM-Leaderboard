[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, we need to check each word in the list `words` and see if it starts with a capital letter. If it does not start with a capital letter, we can remove it using the `delete!()` function.\n\nHere's an example implementation of the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] == uppercase(word[1])\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nThis implementation uses a loop to iterate over each word in the list `words`. We check if the first character of the word (`word[1]`) is uppercase using the `uppercase()` function. If it is uppercase, we add the word to a new list called `filtered_words` using the `push!()` function.\n\nFinally, we return the `filtered_words` list as our output.\n\nLet's test this implementation with an example input:\n```julia\nusing Random\n\nwords = sample(10, 50)\nfiltered_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(\"Original words: \", words)\nprintln(\"Filtered words: \", filtered_words)\n```\nThis code generates a random list of 50 words and passes it to the `keep_only_names()` function. We then print out both the original and filtered lists to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[375,356],"elapsed":16.041174666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
