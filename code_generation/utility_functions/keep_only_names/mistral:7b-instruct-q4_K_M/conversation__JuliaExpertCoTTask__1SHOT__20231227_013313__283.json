[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code. Your communication is brief and concise.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Think through your approach step by step\n- Write any functions and other code you need\n- Solve the task\n- Check that your solution is correct\n\nYou precisely follow the given Task and use the Data when provided. When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Firstly, I will think through my approach step by step:\n1. Iterate over each word in the list.\n2. Check if the word starts with a capital letter.\n3. If it does not start with a capital letter, remove it from the list.\n4. Return the filtered list of words.\n\nNow, I will write the function and other code needed:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if startswith(word, uppercase(word[1]))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nThen, I will solve the task by calling the function with the given input:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nFinally, I will check that my solution is correct by comparing it to the expected output:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]) == [\"Dog\", \"Apple\"]\n```\nThe function `keep_only_names` returns the filtered list of words, which only contains words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[198,294],"elapsed":17.917449959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
