[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the Julia code to solve the task:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if first(word) == uppercase(first(word))\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nThe function takes a vector of strings as input and returns a new vector containing only the words that start with a capital letter. The `filtered_words` vector is initialized as empty and then we iterate over each word in the input vector using a `for` loop. For each word, we check if its first character is uppercase using the `first` function along with `uppercase` to convert it to uppercase. If the first character is uppercase, we append that word to the `filtered_words` vector using the `push!` function. Finally, we return the `filtered_words` vector.","status":200,"tokens":[373,224],"elapsed":10.76373425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
