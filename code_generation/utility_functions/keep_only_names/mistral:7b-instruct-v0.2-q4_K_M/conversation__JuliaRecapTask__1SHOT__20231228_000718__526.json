[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the given special instructions, here are the steps to write the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Control structures: `for` loop\n   - String manipulation: checking the first character of a string using indexing (`words[i][1]`)\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = [] # Create an empty vector to store the words that meet the condition\n\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] isa AbstractChar && isupper(word[1]) # Check if the first character is a capital letter\n            push!(result, word) # Add the word to the result vector\n        end\n    end\n\n    return result # Return the result vector\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function iterates over each word in the provided list and checks if its first character is a capital letter using the `isa` and `isupper` functions. If it meets the condition, the word is added to the result vector using the `push!` function. The final result is the vector containing only the words that meet this condition.","status":200,"tokens":[372,292],"elapsed":13.596385791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
