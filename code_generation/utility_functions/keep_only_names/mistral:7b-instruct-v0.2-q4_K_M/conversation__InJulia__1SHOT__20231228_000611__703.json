The `isfirstletter` function from the `Char` module checks if the first character in the word is uppercase, and if it is, the word is added to a new vector called `filtered_words`. Once all words have been checked, the function returns the `filtered_words` vector containing only the names that begin with capital letters.","status":200,"tokens":[66,199],"elapsed":8.122829792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
