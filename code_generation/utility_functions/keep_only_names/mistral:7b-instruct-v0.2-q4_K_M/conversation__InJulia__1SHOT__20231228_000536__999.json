The function then iterates through each word in the provided list using a `for` loop. If the first letter of a given word is capital, the word is added to the `result` vector using the `pushfirst!` method. Finally, the function returns the `result` vector which contains only the words with a capital first letter.","status":200,"tokens":[66,200],"elapsed":8.167399334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
