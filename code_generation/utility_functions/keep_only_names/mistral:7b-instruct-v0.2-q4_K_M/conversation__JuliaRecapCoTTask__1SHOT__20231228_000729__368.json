[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and special instructions provided, here's how I would approach this task using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n- Control structures: `if` and `for` loops\n- String manipulation: checking the first character of a string\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = AbstractVector{AbstractString}()\n    for word in words\n        if word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z' # check if first character is capital letter\n            pushfirst!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThis function should correctly keep only the words with a capital first letter and remove the others from the input list (array) of strings. It returns a new array containing the desired strings, while the original input remains unchanged.","status":200,"tokens":[374,234],"elapsed":11.268911541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
