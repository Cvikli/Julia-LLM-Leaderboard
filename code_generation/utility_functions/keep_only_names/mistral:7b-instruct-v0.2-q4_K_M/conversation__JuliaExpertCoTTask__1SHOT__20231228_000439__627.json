Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Iterate over each word in the given list.\n   - Check if the first character of the word is capital using the first index and the `isfirst` condition of the String functions. If so, keep that word.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n   ```julia\n   function is_capital(str::AbstractString)\n       return str[1] >= 'A' && str[1] <= 'Z' || str[1] >= 'a' && str[1] <= 'z' && isfirst(str)\n   end\n   ```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   ```julia\n   function keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{<:String})\n       filtered_words = []\n       for word in words\n           if is_capital(word)\n               pushfirst!(filtered_words, word)\n           end\n       end\n       return filtered_words\n   end\n   ```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n   To test the `keep_only_names` function, you can call it with various input lists and compare its output to the expected results:\n\n   ```julia\n   @test keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]) == [\"Apple\", \"Dog\"]\n   @test keep_only_names([\"cat\", \"DOG\", \"Banana\"]) == [\"Cat\", \"DOG\"]\n   @test keep_only_names([\"apple\", \"Apple\", \"banana\"]) == [\"Apple\"]\n   ```","status":200,"tokens":[197,389],"elapsed":16.4078925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
