The `AbstractVector{String}` type indicates that this function accepts a vector (an ordered collection) whose elements are all strings.\n- Inside the function, it uses the `filter` higher-order function to keep only the words starting with an uppercase letter or an underscore (if the word has more than one character). The condition for filtering is defined using anonymous function `x -> ...`.\n- Finally, the function returns the filtered vector as its result.","status":200,"tokens":[66,231],"elapsed":9.357213625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
