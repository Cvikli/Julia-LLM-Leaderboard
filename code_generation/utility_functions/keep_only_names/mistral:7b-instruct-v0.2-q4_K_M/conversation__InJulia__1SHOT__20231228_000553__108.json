It then iterates over each `word` in the input list using a `for` loop. For each word, it checks if the first character is a capital letter or if it's an underscore followed by at least one lowercase letter. If this condition is met, the word is added to the `result` array using the `push!` function. Finally, the function returns the `result` array containing all the words that satisfy the given condition.","status":200,"tokens":[66,238],"elapsed":9.614188041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
