X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the special instructions provided, here are the steps to write the function `keep_only_names` in Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Control structures (if-elseif-else)\n   - String manipulation using the first character (firstindex)\n   - List processing using filter and map functions\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})\n    # Use filter function to select words starting with a capital letter\n    filtered_words = filter(x -> isnothing(firstindex(match(r\"[A-Z]\", x)))? false : true, words)\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `keep_only_names` function takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a new list containing only those strings that start with a capital letter using the regular expression pattern `[A-Z]`. This should meet the requirements specified in the problem statement and the special instructions provided.","status":200,"tokens":[374,249],"elapsed":11.860772292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
