[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the given special instructions, here's how you can write the function `keep_only_names` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if isfirstletter(uppercasefirst(word)) # check if first character is capital\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filter!((x)->isempty(x), filtered_words) # remove empty strings\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. `function keep_only_names(words::AbstractArray{AbstractString})`: Define a function named `keep_only_names`, accepting an argument `words` which is an abstract array of abstract strings.\n2. Initialize an empty vector `filtered_words`.\n3. Use a `for` loop to iterate over each word in the input array `words`.\n4. Use `if-elseif-else` statement or a single line with logical operator `&&` to check if the first character of each word is capital using `isfirstletter` and `uppercasefirst` functions from the standard library. If it's true, add that word to the filtered_words vector using `push!`.\n5. Use `filter!` function from the standard library with an anonymous function to remove empty strings from the `filtered_words` vector.\n6. Finally, return the filtered_words array.","status":200,"tokens":[372,331],"elapsed":15.186445125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
