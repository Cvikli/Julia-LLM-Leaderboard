It checks if the first letter of the word (after capitalizing it with `uppercasefirst`) is not a space or newline character, and if so, adds the word to the `names` list. Finally, it returns the `names` list containing only words that start with a capital letter.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"CAT\", \"Bird\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Outputs: [\"Dog\", \"CAT\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nThis will remove the word \"dog\" from the list of words, as it does not start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[75,274],"elapsed":8.554791583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
