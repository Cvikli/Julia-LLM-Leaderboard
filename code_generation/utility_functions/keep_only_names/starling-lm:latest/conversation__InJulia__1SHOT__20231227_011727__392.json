If it is, then it is added to the `names` list. Otherwise, it is skipped. The function returns a new list with only the words that start with a capital letter. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis will output `[\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]`.","status":200,"tokens":[75,208],"elapsed":6.602037708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
