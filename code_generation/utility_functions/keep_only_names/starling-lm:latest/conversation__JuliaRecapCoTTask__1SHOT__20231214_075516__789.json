[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Understood! Let's get started on the task at hand. Please provide the list of words you want me to process with `keep_only_names`.\n\nTo begin, I will recall some useful Julia snippets for working with lists and strings:\n\n1. List manipulation: `filter(f, l) = [x for x in l if f(x)];`\n2. String manipulation: `\"$ strings\"`; `chars(s) = collect(s);`\n3. Functional programming: `map(f, l) = [f(x) for x in l];`\n4. Slicing and indexing: `[a[1:2], a[2:end]]`; `a[i:j]`; `a[:]`;\n5. Named tuples: `(; name=\"tuple\");`\n6. Dictionaries: `Dict(\"key\" => value)`; `Dict{Key, Value} = Map(f, g)`, where `g` is a function that returns a dictionary with the same keys as `f`.\n7. Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`.\n\nBased on the provided instructions, I will remove all words that do not start with a capital letter.
