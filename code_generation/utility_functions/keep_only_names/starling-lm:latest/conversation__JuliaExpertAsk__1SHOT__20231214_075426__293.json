Here is a possible implementation of the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nkeep_only_names(words) = [w for w in words if w[1] >= 'A']\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes a list of strings `words` as input.\n* We use a generator expression to iterate over the list of words.\n* We use a boolean filter (`if`) to select only the words that start with a capital letter. The filter is applied element-wise, so we check whether the first character of each word is greater than or equal to 'A'.\n* The resulting list of words that meet this condition is returned by the function.\n\nFor example, if `words` is the list `[ \"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\" ]`, then `keep_only_names(words)` will return the list `[ \"Dog\", \"Apple\" ]`.","status":200,"tokens":[98,205],"elapsed":7.265518083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
