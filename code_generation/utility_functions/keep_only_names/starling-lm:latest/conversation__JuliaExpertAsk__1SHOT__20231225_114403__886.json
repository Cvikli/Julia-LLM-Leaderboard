If it is, the word is added to a new list called `filtered_words`. At the end of the iteration, the `filtered_words` list is returned, containing only words with capitalized first letters.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Apple\", \"banana\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Apple\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[116,239],"elapsed":7.697257292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
