[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that fulfills the task description:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = []\n    for word in words\n        if uppercase(word[1]) && all(lowercase.(word) .!= word)\n            push!(filtered_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\nThis function iterates over the provided list of words. For each word, it checks if its first letter is upper case (which indicates a capital letter). If so, and all other characters are not lowercase versions of that character, then the word is added to a new array of filtered_words. At the end, this array is returned, containing only the words that start with an uppercase letter and contain no lowercase characters.\n\nTo test this function, you can use the following driver program:\n```julia\nwords = [\"cat\", \"Dog\", \"fish\", \"dOg\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result)  # Expected output: [\"Dog\"]\n```\nThis driver program creates a list of words and calls the function with this list. The result is printed to the console, showing only the capitalized words as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[381,284],"elapsed":10.491637958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
