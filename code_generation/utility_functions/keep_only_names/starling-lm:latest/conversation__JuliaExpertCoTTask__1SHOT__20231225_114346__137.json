Define the function `keep_only_names` that takes one argument, the list of words (`words`).\n2. Initialize an empty list called `result`, which will store the names that pass the condition.\n3. Iterate over each word in the given list using a for loop. For each iteration:\n   - Check if the first character of the word is a capital letter by using the built-in function `isupper()`. If it returns True, append the word to the result list. Otherwise, skip the current word and move on to the next one.\n4. After iterating through all the words in the given list, return the `result` list.\n5. To verify that your solution works correctly, test it with some example input data.\n6. Run the function with the provided Data: `keep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])`. The expected result should be `[\"Apple\"]`. \n\nHere's the Julia code that follows these steps:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = [] # Step 2: Initialize an empty list to store the names that pass the condition\n    for word in words\n        if uppercase(word[1]) == word[1] # Step 3: Check if the first character of the word is a capital letter, and append the name to the result list if True.\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result # Step 4: Return the `result` list\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test our function with the provided Data:\n\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"]) # Step 5 and 6: Run the function and verify the result is correct. The expected result should be `[\"Apple\"]`. \n```","status":200,"tokens":[206,439],"elapsed":14.347223084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
