It uses the `uppercase()` function to check if the first character of the word is capitalized. If it is, then the entire word is added to a new array called `result`. Finally, the function returns the filtered `result` array containing only the words that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[116,182],"elapsed":6.005218542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
