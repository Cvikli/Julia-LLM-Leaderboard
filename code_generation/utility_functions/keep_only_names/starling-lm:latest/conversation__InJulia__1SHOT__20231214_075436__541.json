Here is an example of how you could implement the `keep_only_names` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    for word in words\n        if first(word) <=> uppercase(first(word))\n            remove!(words, word)\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `for` loop iterates over the list of words `words`.\n* Inside the loop, we use the `if` statement to check if the first character of each word is uppercase. This is done by comparing the first character of the word to the uppercase version of that character using the `<=>` operator.\n* If the first character is not uppercase, we remove the word from the list using the `remove!` function.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n```\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Kitty\"]\nkeep_only_names(words)\n# Output: [\"Dog\", \"Kitty\"]\n```\nIn this example, the words \"dog\" and \"cat\" are removed from the list because they do not start with an uppercase letter. The remaining words in the list are [\"Dog\", \"Kitty\"], which are the only ones that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[69,295],"elapsed":9.907121375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
