Think through the approach: We need to create a function that goes through each element in the `words` list and only keeps the ones that start with a capital letter. We can do this by checking if the first character of each word is uppercase. If it is, we keep the word; otherwise, we discard it.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need: To check if a string starts with a capital letter, we can use the `startswith()` function in Julia. We can define our function as follows:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # Create an empty list to store the filtered words\n    names = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        if word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z'  # Checks if the first character of the word is a capital letter\n            push!(names, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return names\nend\n```\nThis function initializes an empty list `names`, iterates over each word in the input list, and checks if the first character is uppercase. If it is, the word is added to the `names` list. Finally, the function returns this list.\n\n3. Solve the task: Now we can test our function with the provided data:\n```julia\nkeep_only_names([\"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Carrot\", \"dog\"])\n```\nThe expected output is `[\"Apple\", \"Carrot\"]`. This is because \"Apple\" and \"Carrot\" start with a capital letter, while \"banana\" and \"dog\" don't.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct: We can confirm the correctness of our function by manually checking each step of its execution. The `startswith()` function correctly identifies whether a string starts with a specific character or not, and the `push!()` function adds elements to the list in the correct order.\n\nIn conclusion, our solution precisely follows the Task's requirements and uses the provided Data.","status":200,"tokens":[206,472],"elapsed":20.752881333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
