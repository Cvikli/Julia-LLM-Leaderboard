[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Assuming there are no special instructions provided, here's the Julia function implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered = [] # initialize an empty list to store filtered words\n    \n    for word in words # iterate over each element in `words`\n        if startswith.(char('A'), word) || startswith.(char('a'), word)[end] # check if the first character is a capital letter or lowercase\n            push!(filtered, word) # add this word to filtered list\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered # return final filtered list of words\nend\n```\n\nThis function `keep_only_names` takes in an argument `words`, which is the list of input words. Inside the function body, we create a new list named `filtered`. This list will hold only the filtered words that start with capital letters or lowercase characters (as per Julia's multiple dispatch capability).\n\nFor each word in `words`, we check if its first character is either a capital letter ('A') or lowercase ('a'). We use the built-in function `startswith` which returns a boolean array containing whether each element starts with the given string. Since we only care about the last element (the first character), we can access it using index [end]. If our condition is met, we add this word to the filtered list.\n\nAt the end of the function execution, we return `filtered`, which will contain only the desired words with capital-letter starting characters.","status":200,"tokens":[383,336],"elapsed":22.677972333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
