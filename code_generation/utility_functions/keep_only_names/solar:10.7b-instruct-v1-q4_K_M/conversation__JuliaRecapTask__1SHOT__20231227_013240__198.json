[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, we can create a function `keep_only_names` that takes in the list of words as an argument and returns a new filtered list containing only the capitalized words. \n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_list = []\n    \n    for word in words\n        first_letter = view(word, 1)\n        is_capital_letter = first_letter >= 'A' && first_letter <= 'Z' || first_letter >= 'A' && first_letter <= 'Z' && first_letter == view(word, 1) + 32\n        \n        if is_capital_letter\n            push!(filtered_list, word)\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return filtered_list\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function:\n- `view(word, 1)` returns the first character of the given `word`.\n- The condition `first_letter >= 'A' && first_letter <= 'Z'` checks if it is an uppercase letter. \n- The condition `first_letter >= 'A' && first_letter <= 'Z' && first_letter == view(word, 1) + 32` also accounts for lower case letters that are ASCII values shifted by 32 (as 'a' is 97 and 'A' is 65).\n- We iterate over the list of words using a loop `for word in words`, and if the current word's first letter matches our condition, we push it to a new filtered list.\n- Finally, the function returns this filtered list containing only the capitalized words.","status":200,"tokens":[381,370],"elapsed":24.824661375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
