Here's the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_list = [word for word in words if isupper(first(word))]\n    return filtered_list\nend\n```\n\nThis function `keep_only_names` takes a list of strings (`words`) as its input parameter. Inside the function, we use list comprehension to create a new filtered list. The syntax `[expression for variable in collection if condition]` is used. In this case:\n\n- The expression is `word`. It means that each element from the original list will be included in the resultant list.\n- The collection is `words`, which is our input parameter.\n- The filtering condition checks whether the first character of a word (`first(word)`) is an uppercase letter using the `isupper` function provided by Julia. If it's true, the word will be included in the resultant list.\n\nAfter iterating over the given words and applying the filtering condition, the new filtered list is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[75,267],"elapsed":15.82224025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
