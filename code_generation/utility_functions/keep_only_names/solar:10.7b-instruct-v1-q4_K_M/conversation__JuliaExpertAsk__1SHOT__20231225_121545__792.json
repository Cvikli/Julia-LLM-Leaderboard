It creates an empty list `filtered_words`, iterates over the given words using the `for` loop, and checks whether the first character of each word is within the range of uppercase ASCII letters ('A' to 'Z'). If this condition is satisfied, we add that word into our filtered list. Finally, the function returns this list containing only the names/words that start with an uppercase letter.","status":200,"tokens":[116,227],"elapsed":13.856516958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
