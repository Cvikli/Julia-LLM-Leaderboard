[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function that solves this problem:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    filtered_words = [] # Initialize an empty list for our filtered words\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of `word` is a capital letter\n        if word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z'\n            push!(filtered_words, word) # If it is, add this word to our filtered list\n        end\n    end\n    return filtered_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `for` loop to iterate through each element in the provided `words` input. Inside the loop, we check if the first character of the word falls within the range of capital letters (ASCII values 'A' to 'Z'). If it does, we add that word to our filtered list using the `push!` function. Finally, the `return` statement returns this filtered list as the result.","status":200,"tokens":[381,216],"elapsed":15.550636416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
