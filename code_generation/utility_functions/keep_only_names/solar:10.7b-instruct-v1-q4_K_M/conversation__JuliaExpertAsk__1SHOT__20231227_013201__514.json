Inside the function, we use the `filter` function to keep only the elements that satisfy a particular condition. The condition here is to check if the first character of each word isn't either 'a' or 'A'. This indicates that the word doesn't start with a capital letter.\n\nNote: In this implementation, we are assuming that all names begin with uppercase letters and the rest are lowercase (except for non-name words). If the requirement is to handle languages where not all first characters of names are uppercase, you may need to modify the condition.","status":200,"tokens":[116,212],"elapsed":13.046651333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
