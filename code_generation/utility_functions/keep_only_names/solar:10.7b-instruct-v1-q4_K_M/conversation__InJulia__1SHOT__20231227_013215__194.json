It initializes an empty list `filtered_words`. Inside the for loop, it iterates over each word in the provided list (`words`). The regular expression `'^[A-Z]'` checks whether the first character is a capital letter. If this condition is satisfied, the function adds the word to the `filtered_words` list using the `push!` function. Finally, it returns the filtered list with only the words starting with capital letters.","status":200,"tokens":[75,228],"elapsed":13.652168958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
