Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nNote: In Python, strings are indexed starting at 0, so `word[0]` refers to the first character of the string `word`. The method `isupper()` returns `True` if the character is an uppercase letter, and `False` otherwise.\n\nAlso, note that the function `keep_only_names` does not modify the original list of words. Instead, it creates a new list that contains only the words that start with a capital letter, and returns that list. If you want to modify the original list instead, you can do so using the following code:\n```\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n  # Iterate over the list of words\n  for i in range(len(words)):\n    # Check if the word at index i starts with a capital letter\n    if not words[i][0].isupper():\n      # If it does not, remove it from the list\n      del words[i]\n```\nThis implementation removes the words that do not start with a capital letter from the original list, rather than creating a new list and adding the words that start with a capital letter to it.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[64,500],"elapsed":11.134221875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
