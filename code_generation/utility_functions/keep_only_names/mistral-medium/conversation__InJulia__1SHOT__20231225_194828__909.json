If the first character of the word is an uppercase letter (checked using the `isupper` and `first` functions), then it adds the word to the `result` array using the `push!` function. Finally, it returns the `result` array with only the words that start with a capital letter.\n\nNote that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to achieve the same result in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[67,183],"elapsed":4.173032708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
