The first argument to `filter` is an anonymous function that takes a `word` and returns `true` if the first character of the word is equal to its uppercase version (indicating it starts with a capital letter). The second argument is the input list of `words`. The `filter` function returns a new list containing only the elements from the input list for which the anonymous function returns `true`.\n\nConfidence: 99%","status":200,"tokens":[106,162],"elapsed":3.684476583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
