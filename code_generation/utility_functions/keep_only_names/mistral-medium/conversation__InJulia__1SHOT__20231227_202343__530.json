It does this by initializing an empty array `names`, and then iterating over the input array of words using a `for` loop. For each word, it checks if the first character of the word is a capital letter, using the conditions `word[1] >= 'A'` and `word[1] <= 'Z'`. If the word does start with a capital letter, it is added to the `names` array using the `push!` function. Finally, the function returns the `names` array.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this function:\n```\njulia> words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"Cat\", \"dog\", \"Egg\"]\n5-element Array{String,1}:\n \"apple\"\n \"banana\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"dog\"\n \"Egg\"\n\njulia> keep_only_names(words)\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Cat\"\n \"Egg\"\n```\nThis would return an array containing the words `\"Cat\"` and `\"Egg\"`, since those are the only words in the input array that start with a capital letter. The words `\"apple\"`, `\"banana\"`, and `\"dog\"` are not included in the output array, since they do not start with a capital letter.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[67,476],"elapsed":10.628310417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
