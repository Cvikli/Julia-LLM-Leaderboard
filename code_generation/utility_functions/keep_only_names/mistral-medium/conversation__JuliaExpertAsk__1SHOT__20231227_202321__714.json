The predicate in this case is a lambda function that checks whether the first character of the word is an uppercase letter, using the `isupper` function from the `Base.Strings` module and the `first` function to extract the first character of the word.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input is an array of strings. If the input might contain other types of elements, you may want to add additional checks or error handling to ensure that the function behaves correctly.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to see any other examples.\n\nBest regards,\n\nYour world-class Julia programming expert.","status":200,"tokens":[106,226],"elapsed":5.282368875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
