This means that it will also consider words starting with an uppercase letter in any other language that uses a different script, such as \"Яблоко\" in Russian. If you want the function to only consider words starting with an uppercase letter in the English alphabet, you can modify the condition to `word[1] >= 'A' && word[1] <= 'Z' && isletter(word[1])`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[67,407],"elapsed":9.109598209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
