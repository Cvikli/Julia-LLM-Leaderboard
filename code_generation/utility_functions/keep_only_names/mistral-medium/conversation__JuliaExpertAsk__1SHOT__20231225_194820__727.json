The `first` function is used to extract the first character of each word, and the `isupper` function checks whether it is an uppercase letter.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"John\", \"jane\", \"DOG\", \"cat\"])\n2-element Array{String,1}:\n \"John\"\n \"DOG\"\n```\nIn this example, the `keep_only_names` function returns a new array containing only the words \"John\" and \"DOG\", since they are the only words in the input list that start with an uppercase letter. The words \"jane\" and \"cat\" are filtered out.","status":200,"tokens":[106,246],"elapsed":5.510223875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
