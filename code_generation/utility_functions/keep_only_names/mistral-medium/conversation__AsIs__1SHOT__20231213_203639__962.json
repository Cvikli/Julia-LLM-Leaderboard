Here's a Python function that does what you described:\n\n```python\ndef keep_only_names(words):\n    # Filter the list to keep only words that start with a capital letter\n    names = [word for word in words if word[0].isupper()]\n    return names\n```\n\nThis function uses list comprehension to create a new list called `names` that contains only the words from the original `words` list that start with an uppercase letter. The `isupper()` method checks if the first character of each word is uppercase.\n\nFeel free to use this function in your code, and let me know if you need help with anything else!","status":200,"tokens":[64,177],"elapsed":4.000336709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
