The regular expression `r\"^[A-Z]\"` matches any string that starts with an uppercase letter.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"mouse\", \"Fish\"]\nresult = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(result) # Output: [\"Cat\", \"Fish\"]\n```\nThe output shows that only the words starting with a capital letter were kept in the `result` variable.","status":200,"tokens":[71,205],"elapsed":37.5113855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
