[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia implementation of the `keep_only_names` function that follows your guidelines:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    # First, create an empty list to hold only capitalized words.\n    capitalized_words = []\n\n    for word in words\n        # Check if the first character of each word is uppercase using the `startswith` function.\n        if startswith(word, uppercasefirst(String(word[1])))\n            # If it is, add the entire word to our new list.\n            push!(capitalized_words, word)\n        end\n    end\n\n    return capitalized_words\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each word in the `words` list. It checks if the first character of the word is uppercase using the `startswith` function and a helper expression `uppercasefirst(String(word[1]))`, which converts the first character to an uppercase string. If the first character is indeed uppercase, then the entire word is added to a new list called `capitalized_words`.\n\nTo test this function, you can create a test case like:\n\n```julia\nfunction test_keep_only_names()\n    # Test Case 1: Ensure all words are capitalized and kept\n    test = [\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Lion\"]\n    expected = copy(test)\n    @assert keep_only_names(test) == expected \"Test Case 1 failed.\"\n\n    # Test Case 2: Ensure only the capitalized words are kept\n    test = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"Lion\"]\n    expected = [\"Lion\"]\n    @assert keep_only_names(test) == expected \"Test Case 2 failed.\"\nend\n```\n\nThis test case ensures that all words with capital letters are kept (Test Case 1) and only the capitalized words are returned from a list of mixed-case words (Test Case 2).","status":200,"tokens":[382,457],"elapsed":88.090536334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
