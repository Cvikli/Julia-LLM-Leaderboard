[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Julia Snippets\n\n```julia\nfunction remove_lowercase(words::Vector)\n    filtered = filter(w -> startswith(w, uppercasefirst(w)), words)\n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\n# Solution\n\nWe can define the function `keep_only_names` that will take a list of strings and return a new list with only the words starting with an uppercase letter. The function uses the `filter()` function to iterate over each word in the provided list and remove any that do not start with a capital letter.\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words::Vector{String})\n    filtered = filter(w -> startswith(w, uppercasefirst(w)), words)\n    return filtered\nend\n```\n\n# Double-check\n\nTo ensure the solution is correct, we can test it with some sample inputs:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"bird\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) # returns [\"Cat\"]\n\nwords = [\"DOG\", \"CAT\", \"Bird\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) # returns [\"DOG\", \"CAT\", \"Bird\"]\n```\n\nAs seen in the test cases above, the function correctly removes all words that do not start with a capital letter while keeping the ones that do.","status":200,"tokens":[382,312],"elapsed":61.790176542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
