Here's how you could implement it:\n\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    result = []\n    for word in words\n        if isascii(word) && isuppercase(Char(word[1]))\n            push!(result, word)\n        end\n    end\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each word in the input list. It checks if the first character of the word (accessed with `word[1]`) is an uppercase ASCII letter using the `isuppercase()` and `isascii()` functions. If it passes this check, the word is considered a \"name\" and added to the output list (`result`) using the `push!()` function. Finally, the function returns the resulting list of names.\n\nYou can call this function with an example input like so:\n\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Cat\", \"elephant\", \"mouse\"]\nnames = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(names)\n```\n\nThis would output `[\"Cat\"]` because only the word \"Cat\" starts with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[71,295],"elapsed":50.293709542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
