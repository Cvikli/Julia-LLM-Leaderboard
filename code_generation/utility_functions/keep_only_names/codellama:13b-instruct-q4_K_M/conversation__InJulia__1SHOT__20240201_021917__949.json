The `uppercasefirst` function is used to check if the first character of each word is uppercase, and if it is not, then the word is removed from the list.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nwords = [\"dog\", \"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Cat\"]\nkeep_only_names(words) # returns [\"Dog\", \"Cat\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,158],"elapsed":2.066885149,"_type":"aimessage"}]
