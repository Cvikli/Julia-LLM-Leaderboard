The `uppercasefirst` function is used to convert each word to uppercase and then compare it to the original word to determine if it starts with a capital letter. The resulting vector of remaining words is returned from the function.\n\nNote: The `filter!` method modifies the input list in place, so the `words` argument should be passed as a mutable object (e.g. a `Vector{String}`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,173],"elapsed":2.277910581,"_type":"aimessage"}]
