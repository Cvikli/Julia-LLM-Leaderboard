The `uppercasefirst` function is used to check if the first character of each word is a capital letter. If it is, then the word is kept in the output array; otherwise, it is removed.\n\nYou can test this function by providing an input list of words:\n```julia\njulia> keep_only_names([\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\", \"dog\"])\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \"Dog\"\n \"Cat\"\n \"Bird\"\n```\nThis will output a new list of words where only the ones that start with a capital letter are kept.","status":200,"tokens":[0,227],"elapsed":2.979170955,"_type":"aimessage"}]
