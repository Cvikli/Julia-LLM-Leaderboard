In this case, we define the predicate as `word[1] == uppercase(word[1])`, which checks if the first character of the word is an uppercase letter.\n* We use `uppercase` to convert the first character of the word to uppercase and compare it with the original character. If they are equal, then we return `true` and keep the word in the new list, otherwise we return `false` and remove the word from the list.","status":200,"tokens":[0,176],"elapsed":2.332491187,"_type":"aimessage"}]
