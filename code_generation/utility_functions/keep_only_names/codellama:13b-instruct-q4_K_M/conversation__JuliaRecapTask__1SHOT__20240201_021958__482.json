[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter!(x -> startswith(uppercasefirst(x)), words)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. `filter!`: In-place filtering of the provided list, i.e., removing elements from the original list. The function takes a predicate function as its first argument and applies it to each element in the list.\n2. `startswith(uppercasefirst(x))`: Checks if the word starts with an uppercase letter using `startswith` and then converts the first character of the word to uppercase using `uppercasefirst`. If the condition is true, the function returns the original word, else it returns nothing.\n3. The list comprehension syntax `[x for x in words if startswith(uppercasefirst(x))]` can also be used to achieve the same result but this approach is less efficient as it creates a new list with all the matching elements rather than filtering the existing list in-place.","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":2.931782173,"_type":"aimessage"}]
