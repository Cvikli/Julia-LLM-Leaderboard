[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `keep_only_names` which iterates over the provided list of words (`words`) and removes all words that do not start with a capital letter (eg, remove \"dog\" but keep \"Dog\").\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> uppercasefirst(x)[1] == x[1], words)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `filter` function to iterate over the input list of words and keeps only those that start with a capital letter. It first checks if the word starts with a capital letter by comparing it to its uppercase version. If they are not equal, then the word is removed from the output list.\n\nThe `uppercasefirst` function is used to get the uppercase version of the word. This is because the `islowercase` function only works for single characters and not words. By getting the uppercase version of the word, we can check if it starts with a capital letter by comparing it to its original form.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that all words in the input list are strings, and it will remove any non-string elements from the output list. If you want to only keep words that are strings that start with a capital letter, you can modify the function as follows:\n```julia\nfunction keep_only_names(words)\n    return filter(x -> isa(x, AbstractString) && uppercasefirst(x)[1] == x[1], words)\nend\n```\nThis modified version checks if each element in the input list is a string and only keeps strings that start with a capital letter.","status":200,"tokens":[0,305],"elapsed":4.132453842,"_type":"aimessage"}]
