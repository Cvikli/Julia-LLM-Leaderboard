The `startswith` function is used to check if each word starts with a capital letter, and the `uppercase` function is used to convert the first character of each word to uppercase so that it can be compared with the original word.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `keep_only_names` function:\n```julia\nwords = [\"Dog\", \"cat\", \"Bird\"]\nnew_words = keep_only_names(words)\nprintln(new_words) # Output: [\"Dog\", \"Bird\"]\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":2.691884856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
