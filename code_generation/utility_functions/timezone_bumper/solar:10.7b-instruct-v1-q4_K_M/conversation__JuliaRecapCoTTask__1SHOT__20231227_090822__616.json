[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: datetime `dt` and an integer `bump`.\n2. Make sure the provided `dt` is of type DateTime and throw an error if it's of type Date (following the special instructions).\n3. Create a new DateTime by adding `bump` hours to the input DateTime. By default, `bump` should be set to +3 hours.\n4. Return the adjusted DateTime.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n\n    newtime = dt + Hour(bump)\n    return newtime\nend\n```\n\nThis function follows the Julia language syntax guidelines and prioritizes the special instructions. It works only for DateTime types, adding a default bump of 3 hours to the timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[386,242],"elapsed":17.372045125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
