It first checks whether the provided timestamp is a DateTime type by checking if it has an offset or not.\n\nIf the timestamp has an offset, which indicates that it's a `DateTime`, we add `bump` hours to it and return the new `DateTime`. If the timestamp is of type Date (offset is equal to `DateNullOffset()`) or there is an unexpected offset, the function throws an error stating that this method only works with DateTime instances.","status":200,"tokens":[119,248],"elapsed":15.022233833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
