[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

This library provides functions for working with dates and times in various ways. In particular, it contains a type called `DateTime` that represents date and time values and supports adding or subtracting durations such as hours, minutes, etc.\n\nFirstly, let's define the function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)`:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type and throw an error otherwise\n    if typeof(dt) <: Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Timezone bump can only be applied to DateTime values.\"))\n    end\n\n    # Add the specified number of hours (bump) to the datetime value\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThe function first checks if `dt` is a DateTime type using the keyword `typeof`. If it's not, an error message will be thrown. Otherwise, we simply add the specified number of hours to the given datetime value using the `+` operator and the `Hour` constructor from the Dates library.\n\nThis function correctly increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaulting to +3 hours) while throwing an error for Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[386,306],"elapsed":61.375457041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
