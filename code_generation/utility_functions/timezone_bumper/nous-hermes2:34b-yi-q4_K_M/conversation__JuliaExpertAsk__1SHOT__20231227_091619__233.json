The function first checks if the input is a DateTime type using `typeof(dt)` and then proceeds with the calculation only when it's a DateTime type. It calculates the new value of the DateTime by adding an hour component (converted from integer `bump` to Dates.Hour type) to its original value.\n\nIf the input is a Date type, the function throws an error as it cannot increase a Date type by hours; users should use DateTime instead. If other data types are provided for `dt`, the function also throws an error because only DateTime and Date types are supported by this function.","status":200,"tokens":[114,312],"elapsed":53.867781291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
