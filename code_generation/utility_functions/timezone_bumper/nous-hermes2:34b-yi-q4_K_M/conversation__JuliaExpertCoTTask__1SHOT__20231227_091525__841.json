If a Date object is given, we'll throw an error.\n\nHere's how our function will look like:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime object\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with the given example:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\nThis should return `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)`.","status":200,"tokens":[210,251],"elapsed":69.711685375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
