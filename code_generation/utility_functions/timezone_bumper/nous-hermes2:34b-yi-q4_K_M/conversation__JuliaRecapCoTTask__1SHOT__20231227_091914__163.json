[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The `timezone_bumper` function will take a `DateTime` and an optional `bump::Int` parameter. If no `bump` is provided, it will default to +3 hours (`bump = 3`). The function should increase the timestamp of the inputted DateTime by this number of hours, returning another DateTime object. \n\nHere's how you can implement this using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Define a function that increases a given datetime by `bump` hours\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    try\n        return DateTime(Dates.value(dt) + (60 * 60 * bump))\n    catch e\n        if isa(e, MethodError) || isa(e, ArgumentError)\n            throw(DomainError(\"This function only works with DateTime types and not Date types.\"))\n        else\n            rethrow()\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `try-catch` construct to check whether an input is a `DateTime` type. If it's not, a `DomainError` will be thrown with a specific error message. The `+=` operation on `Dates.value(dt)` works because `value` returns a floating point number representing the time since 1970 in seconds, so we can simply add or subtract whole hours from it by multiplying by 3600 (seconds per hour) and then 24 for days (hours per day).\n\nThis function should work as expected with `DateTime` inputs and throw an error for `Date` inputs.","status":200,"tokens":[388,358],"elapsed":70.328329709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
