[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

This will return a `Real` value if the input is a `Date` type, so we can use it as a condition to throw an error with `MethodError`.\n  - If the input is valid, create a new DateTime object by adding 24 * `bump` days (since there are 24 hours in a day) and keep the original time component from the provided `dt` using `Time(dt)`. \n\n- Double-check that the solution is correct:\n  - The function only works for `DateTime` types, throwing an error if a `Date` type is passed as input.\n  - The timestamp increase is done correctly by adding `bump * 24` hours (using days) to the provided date and keeping the original time component from the input DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[388,384],"elapsed":74.722254584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
