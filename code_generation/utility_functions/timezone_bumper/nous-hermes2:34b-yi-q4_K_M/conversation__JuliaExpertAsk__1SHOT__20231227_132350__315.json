The second argument has a default value of 3 hours if no other value is provided. It checks whether the first argument (`dt`) is an instance of DateTime or Date type using the `typeof(dt)` operator. If it's a DateTime, the function increases its timestamp by adding the `Hour(bump*60)` to its existing value. \n\nFor example, if the current DateTime is \"2021-05-30T19:00\" and we want to add 3 hours (default), it would become \"2021-05-30T22:00\". If `dt` is a Date type, the function throws an error with a message indicating that it only works for DateTime types.","status":200,"tokens":[114,266],"elapsed":46.217831333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
