[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It returns the same timestamp but shifted by `bump` hours. \n- Inside the function, we use multiple dispatch on different types of arguments, which is a feature unique to Julia language. If the argument passed as `dt` is not a DateTime object, an error will be thrown. \n- For Date objects, if they are provided, it will throw an error because it does not make sense to add timezone information to dates. The provided date would be interpreted as the start of that day (0:00:00) and adding hours would yield a DateTime object, which is not what we expect from a Date object. \n- By using `DateTime(dt)` and `Dates.Hour(bump)`, we convert both arguments into DateTime objects and add the timezone offset in hours to it.\n- The last line of code tests this function with an invalid input (a Dates.Date object) which should throw an error as per our requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[386,333],"elapsed":65.962826375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
