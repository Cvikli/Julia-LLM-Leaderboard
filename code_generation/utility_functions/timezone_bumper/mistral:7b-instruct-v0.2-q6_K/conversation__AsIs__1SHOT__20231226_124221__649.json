Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'm an AI language model and can't directly write code, but I can certainly help you write a function in your preferred programming language that meets the requirements you've outlined. Here's an example implementation in R:\n\n```R\ntimezone_bumper <- function(dt, bump = 3) {\n  if (is.na(dt$hour) || is.na(dt$minutes) || is.na(dt$seconds)) {\n    stop(\"Error: timezone_bumper can only be used with DateTime types.\")\n  }\n  \n  new_hours <- dt$hour + bump\n  new_mins <- ifelse(new_hours > 23, new_hours - 24, new_hours) * 60\n  new_secs <- ifelse(new_mins > 60, new_mins - 60, new_mins) %% 60\n  \n  list(hour = new_hours, minute = new_mins %/% 60, second = new_secs,\n       microsecond = dt$microsecond)\n}\n```\n\nThis function checks if the input `dt` is a DateTime type by checking for the presence of hour, minutes, and seconds fields. If any of these are missing (indicating that `dt` is a Date type), an error message will be displayed. The function then calculates the new timestamp by adding the given number of hours (defaulting to 3) to the input datetime and handles rollovers to the next day as necessary.\n\nThis implementation uses R syntax, so adjust it accordingly if you're using a different programming language. Keep in mind that error handling can vary between languages.","status":200,"tokens":[66,389],"elapsed":21.383591417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
