Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Check if the input is of type DateTime.\n   - If it is a DateTime, calculate the new datetime by adding the given number of hours to the existing one.\n   - If it is not a DateTime or a Date (which we'll check separately), throw an error.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Your code here\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        error(\"timezone_bumper: Invalid input, should be a DateTime type.\")\n    end\n\n    new_dt = dt + Hours(bump)\n    return new_dt\nend\n```\n\n4.
