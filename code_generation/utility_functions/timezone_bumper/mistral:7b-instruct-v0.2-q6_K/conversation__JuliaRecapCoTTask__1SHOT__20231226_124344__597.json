X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Define a function\n   - Use conditional statements (if-else) based on data type checks\n   - Throw an error using `error(\"Message\")`\n   - Work with DateTime types\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if eltype(dt) <: AbstractDate\n        error(\"Invalid argument type. timezone_bumper() only accepts DateTime types.\")\n    end\n    \n    new_dt = dt + Hour(bump)\n    return new_dt\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - Make sure the function takes a `DateTime` as its first argument and an optional `Int` as its second argument with a default value of 3 hours.\n   - Check if the argument is of type `AbstractDate` using `<:` operator, which checks if one type is a subtype of another, and throw an error if it's not a DateTime type.\n   - Add the given number of hours to the provided DateTime object using the `Hour()` function from the `Dates` library.\n   - Return the new DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[377,310],"elapsed":19.045541791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
