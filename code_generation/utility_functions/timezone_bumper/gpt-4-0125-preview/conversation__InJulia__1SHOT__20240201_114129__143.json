It checks the type of the input to ensure it is a `DateTime` and not a `Date`, and throws an error if a `Date` type is passed to it.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Function to bump a timestamp by a specified number of hours, defaults to +3\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)::DateTime\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Method definition to throw an error when a 'Date' type is passed\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)::DateTime\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper function expects a DateTime object, got Date.\"))\nend\n\n# Example usage\ndt_example = DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 12)  # April 1st, 2023, at 12:00\ntry\n    bumped_timestamp = timezone_bumper(dt_example)  # Bump by default 3 hours\n    println(\"Original timestamp: \", dt_example)\n    println(\"Bumped timestamp: \", bumped_timestamp)\ncatch e\n    println(e.message)\nend\n\n# Attempt to use the function with a Date\ndate_example = Date(2023, 4, 1)\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(date_example)\ncatch e\n    println(e.message)\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines two methods for `timezone_bumper`:\n- The first method handles `DateTime` inputs, adding the specified number of hours to the input datetime.\n- The second method catches attempts to use a `Date` type, throwing an ArgumentError to inform the user of the incorrect usage.\n\nMake sure to have the `Dates` module available in your Julia environment as it provides the `DateTime`, `Date`, and `Hour` types and functionalities used in these functions.","status":200,"tokens":[67,408],"elapsed":31.199626042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
