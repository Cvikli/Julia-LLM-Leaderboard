[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

This function will increase the provided timestamp by `bump` hours. If a `Date` type is passed to the function, it will throw an error to inform the user that only `DateTime` types are supported. \n\nHere is the step-by-step approach to solve this task:\n\n### Recall Julia Snippets Useful for This Task\n\n1. Checking type of a variable: `typeof(var)`.\n2. Adding hours to a `DateTime` object: Use of `Dates.Hour()` from the `Dates` standard library.\n3. Conditional statement to ensure the function operates only on `DateTime` objects.\n4. Error handling in Julia: `throw(ErrorException(\"Error message\"))`.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Increase the provided timestamp by bump hours\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int)\n    # If Date type is passed, throw an error\n    throw(ErrorException(\"timezone_bumper only supports DateTime type, not Date.\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis solution uses multiple dispatch to handle `DateTime` and `Date` types differently. If a `Date` type is passed, the second `timezone_bumper` function definition will catch it and throw an appropriate error. This design adheres to the requirement of throwing an error for `Date` types while correctly adjusting timestamps for `DateTime` types.\n\n### Double-check the Solution is Correct\n\n1. **Case with DateTime**: Applying the function to a `DateTime` object with a +3 hours bump (and other bump values) should correctly add the specified hours.\n2. **Case with Date**: Applying the function to a `Date` object should result in an error being thrown.\n\n**Note**: Since `Date` does not carry time information, it's not compatible with operations that add or subtract specific hours, which is why the restriction to `DateTime` is necessary for this task.","status":200,"tokens":[325,456],"elapsed":18.570712417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
