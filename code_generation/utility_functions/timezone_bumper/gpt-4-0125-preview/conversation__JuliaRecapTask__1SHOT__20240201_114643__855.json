X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"### Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n\nFor this task, we will utilize Julia's DateTime functionality within the Dates module. Particularly, to add hours to a given timestamp, we will make use of the `Dates.Hour` function. We will also need to use type assertions to ensure the function only works with `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Overload the function to throw an error when a Date type is passed\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int)\n    error(\"Function only supports DateTime, not Date.\")\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation defines `timezone_bumper`, which accepts a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump`, then adds the specified number of hours to the datetime object. It defaults to +3 hours if the bump is not specified. Additionally, it provides an overloaded version of the function for `Date` objects. Instead of performing any operation, it immediately throws an error, maintaining the requirement that the function should not work for `Date` types.\n\n### Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the implementation let's check some aspects:\n\n1. The function correctly adds the specified number of hours to a `DateTime` object.\n2. The function defaults to adding 3 hours if no specific bump is given.\n3. The function throws an error when a `Date` object is passed instead of a `DateTime` object.\n\nBy the defined behavior, we ensure that the function operates correctly for `DateTime` instances, adheres to its default behavior, and restricts usage with `Date` types, as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[324,366],"elapsed":24.4510505,"_type":"aimessage"}]
