It correctly solves the problem by accepting a `DateTime` object and an integer representing the number of hours to bump. The second definition catches attempts to use the function with a `Date` object and throws an error, ensuring that the function strictly works only with `DateTime` types. The example usage at the end correctly increases the provided timestamp by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[181,226],"elapsed":8.486983333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
