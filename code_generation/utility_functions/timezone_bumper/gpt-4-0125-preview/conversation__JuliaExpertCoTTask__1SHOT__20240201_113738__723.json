Define the function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)` which takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump` which defaults to 3.\n2. Inside the function, I will add `bump` hours to `dt` by using the `Dates` module in Julia, specifically the `Hour` type for incrementing the time.\n3. If `dt` is not a `DateTime` instance, I will raise an error.\n4. Test the function with the provided data to ensure it works as expected.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with the provided data\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))\n```\n\nThis implementation satisfies the task requirements by defining a function that increases a `DateTime` object by a specified number of hours, defaulting to 3 if not specified. It will also restrict input to only `DateTime` types, ensuring correct functionality.","status":200,"tokens":[181,244],"elapsed":21.418164917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
