Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that meets your requirements:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)::DateTime\n    if !(typeof(dt) <: DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper() only works with DateTime types.\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which is the input date and time, and `bump`, which specifies the number of hours to add (defaults to 3). If `bump` is negative, it will subtract the corresponding number of hours.\n\nThe function first checks that `dt` is a DateTime type by checking if it's an instance of the DateTime class or any of its subclasses. If not, it throws an ArgumentError.\n\nThen, it uses the `Dates.Hour()` function to add the specified number of hours to the input date and time. This returns a new DateTime object with the updated time.\n\nNote that this function will also work for timestamps with millisecond precision by using the `Dates.MilliSecond` function instead of `Dates.Hour`.","status":200,"tokens":[79,268],"elapsed":14.684621958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
