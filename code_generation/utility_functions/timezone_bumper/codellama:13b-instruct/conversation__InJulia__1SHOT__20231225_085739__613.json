Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)::DateTime\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which is the timestamp to increase, and `bump`, which is the number of hours to add to the timestamp (defaulting to 3). The function first checks that `dt` is a `DateTime` object using the `isa` function. If it is not, an `ArgumentError` exception is thrown.\n\nIf the input is valid, the function returns the result of adding the `bump` hours to the timestamp using the `+` operator and the `Dates.Hour` type.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2023, 4, 15, 12, 0, 0)\n2023-04-15T12:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2023-04-15T15:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, 6)\n2023-04-15T18:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[82,346],"elapsed":18.835416625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
