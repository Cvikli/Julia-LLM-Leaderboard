Here is a function `timezone_bumper` that does as you described:\n```\nimport datetime\n\ndef timezone_bumper(dt: datetime.datetime, bump: int = 3) -> datetime.datetime:\n    \"\"\"\n    Bumps the provided timestamp by the given number of hours (defaults to +3 hours).\n\n    Args:\n        dt (datetime.datetime): The timestamp to bump\n        bump (int, default=3): The number of hours to bump the timestamp by\n\n    Returns:\n        datetime.datetime: The updated timestamp with the given bump\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input is a `date` rather than a `datetime` object\n    \"\"\".\n    if not isinstance(dt, datetime.datetime):\n        raise ValueError(\"Expected a datetime object, got {0!r}\".format(type(dt)))\n    return dt + datetime.timedelta(hours=bump)\n```\nYou can use this function by calling it with the timestamp and the number of hours you want to bump it by, like this:\n```\n>>> dt = datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)\n>>> timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\ndatetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 15, 0, 0)\n```\nNote that this function only works with `datetime` objects, and will raise a `ValueError` if you try to pass a `date` object as input. If you need to bump a `date` object, you'll need to convert it to a `datetime` object first using the `date()` method.","status":200,"tokens":[57,392],"elapsed":13.021618625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
