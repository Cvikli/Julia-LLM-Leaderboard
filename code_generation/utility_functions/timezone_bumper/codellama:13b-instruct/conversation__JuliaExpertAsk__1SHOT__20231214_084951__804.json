Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's the function you requested:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Handle Date types\n    if dt isa Date\n        error(\"cannot bump a Date type\")\n    else\n        # Calculate new timestamp\n        new_time = dt + bump * hours()\n        return new_time\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `dt` (a DateTime object) and `bump` (an integer representing the number of hours to bump the timestamp).\n* We first check if `dt` is a Date type using the `isa` keyword. If it is, we throw an error.\n* Otherwise, we calculate the new timestamp by adding `bump` hours to the original `dt` using the `hours()` function, which returns the number of hours since midnight.\n* Finally, we return the new timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[103,215],"elapsed":7.614346917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
