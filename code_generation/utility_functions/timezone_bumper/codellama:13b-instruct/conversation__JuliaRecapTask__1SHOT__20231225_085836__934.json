[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

We first import the Dates module to work with date and time objects in Julia.\n2. The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments, a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer argument `bump` that represents the number of hours to increase the timestamp by (defaults to +3 hours).\n3. We check if the type of `dt` is a subtype of `DateTime`, otherwise we throw an error indicating that this function only works with DateTime types.\n4. If the input is valid, we return the result of increasing the timestamp by `bump` hours using the `+` operator and the `Hour` function from the Dates module.\n5. The output type of the function is explicitly declared as `DateTime` to ensure that the function only returns a DateTime object.\n6. We use the `typeof` function to check if the input is a valid DateTime type or not, which ensures that the function will work correctly with different types of inputs.\n7. We wrap the entire function in a try-catch block to handle any errors that may occur during execution. This ensures that the function will always return an error message if something goes wrong.","status":200,"tokens":[382,350],"elapsed":22.206053292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
