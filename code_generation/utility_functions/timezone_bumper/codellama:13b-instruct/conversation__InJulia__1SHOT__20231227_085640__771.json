Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the implementation of `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3) :: DateTime\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Cannot perform timezone bump on a Date type\"))\n    end\n\n    new_dt = dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    return new_dt\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` which is the DateTime object, and `bump` which is the number of hours to bump the time by (defaults to 3). It checks if the `dt` argument is a Date type or not. If it's a Date type, it throws an ArgumentError exception. Otherwise, it creates a new DateTime object with the same date as the original and the time increased by `bump` hours using the `Dates.Hour` function.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use this function:\n```julia\n# Bumping a DateTime object by 5 hours\ndt = DateTime(2019, 10, 30, 14)\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprintln(bumped_dt) # prints 2019-10-30T19:00:00.000\n\n# Bumping a Date object by 6 hours (throws an error)\ndate = Date(2019, 10, 30)\nbumped_date = timezone_bumper(date, 6) # throws ArgumentError\n```","status":200,"tokens":[82,368],"elapsed":20.160538375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
