Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)::DateTime\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Timezone bumper only works for DateTime types.\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Increase the timestamp by bump hours\n    new_dt = dt + Hour(bump)\n    \n    return new_dt\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` which is a `DateTime` type and `bump` which is an integer that represents the number of hours to increase the timestamp by. The default value for `bump` is 3 hours.\n\nThe function first checks if `dt` is a `DateTime` type, if not it throws an error. Then it increases the timestamp by `bump` hours using the `+` operator and returns the new `DateTime` object.\n\nNote that this implementation only works for `DateTime` types and will throw an error if you try to pass a `Date` type instead. Also, it does not handle other types of timezones such as UTC or DST.","status":200,"tokens":[82,277],"elapsed":15.167135208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
