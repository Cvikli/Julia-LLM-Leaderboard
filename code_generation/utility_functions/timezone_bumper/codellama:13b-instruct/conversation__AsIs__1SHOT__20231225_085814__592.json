Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function:\n```\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)::DateTime\n    if dt isa Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Timezone bumper only works for DateTime types\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be a `DateTime` object, and an optional argument `bump` of type `Int`. The default value of `bump` is 3 hours.\n\nIf the provided `dt` argument is not a `DateTime` object, the function throws an error. This ensures that the function only works with `DateTime` objects and avoids unexpected behavior when it's called with a `Date` object.\n\nThe function returns the bumped `DateTime` value by adding the `bump` hours to the original `dt`. The `Dates.Hour(bump)` part is used to create a `Duration` object that represents the number of hours to add, and then it's added to the `dt` using the `+` operator.\n\nFor example, if you call the function with `timezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2019-06-01T12:34:56\"), 2)`, it will return a `DateTime` object that represents June 2, 2019 at 14:34:56.\n\nThis function can be useful when you need to adjust the time zone of a timestamp by a fixed amount, such as when working with data that spans multiple time zones.","status":200,"tokens":[79,369],"elapsed":20.033072417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
