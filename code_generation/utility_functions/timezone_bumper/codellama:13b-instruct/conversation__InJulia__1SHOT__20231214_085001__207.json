Here's an example of how you could implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n```\n# Use the DateTime type to handle timestamps\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if the input is a Date type\n    if dt.isdate\n        error(\"cannot bump a date\")\n    else\n        # Bump the timestamp by the provided number of hours\n        dt += bump * DateTime.Hours(1)\n        return dt\n    end\nend\n```\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```\n# Create a DateTime object\ndt = DateTime(\"2023-03-14 10:00:00\")\n\n# Bump the timestamp by 3 hours\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\n\n# The bumped DateTime object will have a timestamp of \"2023-03-14 13:00:00\"\nprintln(bumped_dt)\n```\nNote that the `isdate` function is used to check if the input is a Date type. If the input is a Date, an error will be thrown. Otherwise, the function will modify the timestamp by the provided number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[74,291],"elapsed":9.779534458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
