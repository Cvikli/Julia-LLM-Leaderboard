[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` argument for the bump amount. The function simply returns the original date-time value plus the specified number of hours (defaults to +3). The function uses the built-in `Hour()` function from the `Dates` module to perform the time arithmetic.\n\nNote that this function only works with DateTime types, and throws an error if a Date type is provided. This is because Date types do not have a time component, so they cannot be bumped by hours. If you need to support both DateTime and Date types, you can use a more complex approach, such as converting the Date type to a DateTime type with a time component of 00:00:00 before performing the bump.\n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Create a DateTime object for November 15, 2022 at 14:30:00 UTC\ndt = DateTime(2022, 11, 15, 14, 30, 0)\n\n# Bump the time by +3 hours\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)\nprintln(\"Original date-time: $dt\")\nprintln(\"Bumped date-time: $bumped_dt\")\n```\nThis code will output the following:\n```julia\nOriginal date-time: 2022-11-15T14:30:00Z\nBumped date-time: 2022-11-15T17:30:00Z\n```","status":200,"tokens":[385,407],"elapsed":25.676757667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
