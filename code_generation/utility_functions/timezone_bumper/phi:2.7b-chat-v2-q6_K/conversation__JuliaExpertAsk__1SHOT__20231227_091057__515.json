Each represents a different bump value for the `timezone_bumper` function. \n\nThe rules are as follows:\n1) GMT is represented by 4 hours in the function.\n2) EST is represented by 1 hour less than GMT.\n3) PST is represented by 2 hours less than CST.\n4) CST is represented by 3 hours more than EST.\n5) You're given a `timezone_bumper` function that takes a timestamp and an integer bump value as parameters, and should return the new timestamp after adding the specified number of hours. \n6) The timestamp to be bumped has the following format: \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"\n7) It is given that the timezone_bumper function works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\nQuestion: If a `timezone_bumper` function call returns a timestamp with GMT as its time zone, what would be the format of the original timestamp?\n\n\nFirst, we need to convert each time zone's bump value into its equivalent in hours, then add it to the given `bump`. \n- GMT: 4 hours\n- EST: 3 hours - 1 hour = 2 hours\n- PST: CST + 2 hours - 2 hours = CST\n- CST: EST + 3 hours + 3 hours = EST + 6 hours or 9 hours.\n\nFrom step1, we know that GMT is represented by 4 hours in the function and EST is represented by 3 hours less than GMT. This means EST also represents a bump of 4 - 1 = 3 hours (which is what we've assigned to it). \nSince CST is represented as PST + 2 hours, CST must represent a bump of CST hours, which means CST = PST + 6 hours or 9 hours.\n\nFrom step2, CST and EST are equivalent in terms of their time zone bumps. Since CST represents the same amount of hours as GMT, GMT also represents CST's bump value, which is CST = EST + 6 hours or 9 hours. \nThis contradicts our initial information from step1 that CST has a different bump than GMT (4 vs 9). Therefore, our assumption in step2 must be wrong and CST actually represents CST hours, not CST + 6 hours. This means CST = PST - 2 hours.\n\nNow we know that EST = 3 hours and CST = PST - 2 hours. From rule 4, CST = EST + 6 hours or 9 hours which contradicts what we found in step3. This indicates a contradiction in our assumption in Step 1. \nTherefore, CST must represent CST hours (3 hours more than EST) not CST + 6 hours. So, CST = EST + 3 hours.\n\nThis implies that GMT and PST both represent CST hours as they're equivalent to each other. Hence, the only logical way forward is that CST represents CST hours. \nTherefore, CST = PST - 2 hours (which means CST and PST are equivalent).\n\nFinally, we know from step 5 that CST represents CST hours and CST = PST - 2 hours. This means CST also represents CST + 6 hours or 9 hours which contradicts what we've found in Step 3. Therefore, this leads us to a contradiction. \nHence, the only logical way forward is that GMT must represent GMT hours and therefore GMT = CST.\nSo, GMT = EST (which implies GMT = PST - 2 hours) and CST represents CST + 6 hours or 9 hours which contradicts what we've found in Step 3. Therefore, CST also represents CST + 6 hours or 9 hours. \n\nAnswer: The original timestamp would be in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\" and it would include the correct time zone bump value based on each timezone's rules as described above.","status":200,"tokens":[108,872],"elapsed":23.812330625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
