You are an astrophysicist working in different time zones and need to adjust your observation times for a conference call with your colleagues across the globe. \n2. The observatory you're currently at is in New York (UTC-5 hours).\n3. You have to observe a rare celestial event happening on the same day, but it's only visible from different parts of the world at different times due to Earth's rotation and timezone differences.\n4. Your colleagues are located in Tokyo (UTC+9), London (UTC+0) and Sydney (UTC+10). \n5. The celestial event starts exactly at 9:00 PM local time in New York.\n6. You need your colleagues from Tokyo, London and Sydney to observe the event simultaneously. However, you only have a total of 10 hours to adjust all observation times as they can't observe for more than 2 extra hours compared to their usual observation time due to weather restrictions. \n7. It takes each colleague approximately 1 hour to adjust their observation time by your New York's timezone (UTC-5) using the `timezone_bumper` function you wrote above, but there is a bug in your code that causes the adjustment time to vary between 0.25 and 2 hours for all colleagues.\n8. You need to find out how much time each colleague will spend adjusting their observation time by New York's timezone to adjust them to observe the celestial event at 9:00 PM local time in New York, without exceeding your 10-hour limit or causing any delay beyond usual observation times due to weather restrictions. \n\nQuestion: How many hours does each of your colleagues need to spend adjusting their observation times?\n\n\nFirst, we calculate the adjustment times needed for each colleague using the `timezone_bumper` function and the range given (0.25-2) as an indicator that there's a bug in our code. \n```julia\ntokyo_bump = timezone_bumper(9:00 PM + 9*60*60, bump=1.25) - 9:00 PM\nlondon_bump = timezone_bumper(9:00 PM + 9*60*60, bump=0.75) - 9:00 PM\nsydney_bump = timezone_bumper(9:00 PM + 9*60*60, bump=2) - 9:00 PM\n```\n\nThen we check if the calculated adjustment times exceed our 10-hour limit or cause delay beyond usual observation times due to weather restrictions. \n```julia\nif tokyo_bump > 10 || london_bump > 2 + 1*60*60 || sydney_bump > 2 + 2*60*60 then\n  warn(\"Bug in the code! Observation time adjustments are not possible.\")\nelse\n  warnings.Println(\"No bug in the code!\")\nend\n```\nThis will either print \"No bug in the code!\" if the adjustment times can be made within the given conditions or a warning indicating that there's a bug in our code which prevents this from happening.\n\nIf it prints \"No bug in the code!\", we know that all observations can happen simultaneously without any delay or exceeding weather restrictions, so each of your colleagues only needs to adjust their observation time by New York's timezone (UTC-5) for one hour.\n```julia\nwarnings.Println(\"All observations will happen at once.\")\nend\n```\nIf it prints a warning indicating there's a bug in our code, we need to find out the maximum valid adjustment times using proof by exhaustion and inductive logic. \n```julia\nmax_tokyo = min(10 - 9:00 PM - 1*60*60, 2 + 1*60*60)\nmax_london = min(10 - 9:00 PM - 0.75*60*60, 3 + 0.75*60*60)\nmax_sydney = min(10 - 9:00 PM - 2*60*60, 4 + 2*60*60)\n```\nThen we can distribute the available time for adjustment among your colleagues based on their maximum possible adjustment times using deductive logic. \n```julia\nif max_tokyo == 0 then\n  warn(\"Tokyo can't adjust.\")\nelse if max_london == 0 then\n  warn(\"London can't adjust.\")\nelse if max_sydney == 0 then\n  warn(\"Sydney can't adjust.\")\nend\n```\nIf there's no warning, we know that each of your colleagues only needs to spend 1 hour adjusting their observation time by New York's timezone (UTC-5) as the adjustment times they calculated with our function do not exceed the 10-hour limit. \n\nAnswer: Each of your colleagues from Tokyo, London and Sydney need to spend exactly one hour adjusting their observation times.","status":200,"tokens":[108,1235],"elapsed":34.587734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
