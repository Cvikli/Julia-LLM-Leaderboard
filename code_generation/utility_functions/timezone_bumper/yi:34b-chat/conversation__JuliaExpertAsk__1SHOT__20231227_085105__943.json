Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if !isdate(dt)\n        # If the input is not a DateTime type, throw an error\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type.\"))\n    end\n    \n    hour = (bump % 24)\n    new_time = Hour(hour):Hour(1):DateTime(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, hour)\n    return first(filter(t -> t > dt, new_time))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a `DateTime` object and an optional integer `bump` specifying the number of hours to add. If no bump is provided, it adds 3 hours by default. The function checks if the input is a `DateTime` type; if not, an `ArgumentError` is thrown.\n\nThe body of the function creates a range of dates starting from the current time and increases the hour by one until it reaches or exceeds the specified bump in hours. Then it filters this range to find the first timestamp that is greater than the input `dt`. The `first()` function returns the first element of the filtered range, which is the new DateTime with the bumped timezone offset.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the date part of the `DateTime` does not change during the bumping process, as it is only increasing the time portion. If the input `dt` has a timezone information, this function should adjust for that as well. However, since no specific timezone handling is provided in the question, I've assumed a naive approach where the date and timezone parts are unchanged.","status":200,"tokens":[114,365],"elapsed":49.46956725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
