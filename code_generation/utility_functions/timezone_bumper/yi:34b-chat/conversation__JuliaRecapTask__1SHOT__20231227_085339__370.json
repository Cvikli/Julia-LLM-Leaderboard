[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It then converts the given `DateTime` to a local time and adjusts it by the specified number of hours. The original date is kept unchanged, and the new local time is combined with the original date plus any offset from UTC to produce a new `DateTime` object.\n\nThe function also includes a test to ensure that `timezone_bumper(now())` increases the current time by 3 hours as expected. Additionally, there is a test to show that providing a negative `bump` decreases the time accordingly.\n\nFor `Date` types, an error is thrown with a clear message indicating that `timezone_bumper` cannot be applied to `Date` types. This is done by throwing a `DomainError`, which is appropriate for situations where the domain of the function does not include the input value.\n\nPlease note that the use of `stdlibs` is a Julia 1.8 feature and may need to be replaced with the relevant package name in earlier versions of Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[386,552],"elapsed":82.833874625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
