Here is the function you requested:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Union{Int,Nothing})\n    if bump == nothing\n        bump = 3 # Default bump of +3 hours by default\n    end\n    dt += Timestamp(bump)\n    return dt\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `dt` (a `DateTime` type), and `bump` (an `Int` or `Nothing` - the default is +3 hours).\n* If `bump` is `nothing`, it defaults to +3 hours.\n* We add `bump` hours to the `dt` timestamp using the `Timestamp` function, which returns a new timestamp with the specified number of hours added.\n* The modified `dt` is returned from the function.\n\nNote: This function only works for DateTime types, and will throw an error if `dt` is a Date type.","status":200,"tokens":[103,218],"elapsed":7.6744565,"_type":"aimessage"}]
