[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Let's get started on the task of creating a function `timezone_bumper` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours, while prioritizing the special instructions given.\n\nStep 1 - Recall Julia Snippets (5 minutes)\n\n* Review key syntax and language features such as variables, control structures, functions, arrays, slicing, tuples, namedtuples, dictionaries, string interpolation, and more.\n* Refresh on how to use standard libraries and avoid new packages unless explicitly requested.\n\nStep 2 - Solve the Task (30 minutes)\n\n* Create a function `timezone_bumper` that takes in `dt` (DateTime type) and `bump` (Int) as input.\n* Implement the logic to increase the timestamp by the provided bump hours.\n* Handle errors gracefully when `dt` is of type Date.\n\nStep 3 - Double-check the Solution (10 minutes)\n\n* Test the function with various input combinations, such as `timezone_bumper(Date(\"2023-03-05\"), 3)` and `timezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2023-03-05T13:45:00\"), 6)`.\n* Verify that the function works correctly and throws an error when `dt` is of type Date.\n\nStep 4 - Special Instructions (10 minutes)\n\n* Since there are no special instructions provided, proceed with implementing the function as usual.\n\nStep 5 - Finalize and Test (10 minutes)\n\n* Run the function with various input combinations to ensure it works correctly.\n* Test the function with edge cases, such as negative bump hours or invalid timestamp inputs.\n\nTotal Time: 60 minutes","status":200,"tokens":[374,400],"elapsed":17.67265575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
