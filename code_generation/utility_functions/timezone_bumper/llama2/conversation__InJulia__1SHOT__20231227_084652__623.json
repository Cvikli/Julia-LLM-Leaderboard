Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Of course! Here is a possible implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if input is a DateTime type\n    if dt isa DateTime\n        # Increase timestamp by bump hours\n        new_dt = dt + DateDiff(hours=bump);\n        return new_dt;\n    elseif dt isa Date\n        # Throw an error if input is not a DateTime\n        throw(\"Error: Input must be a DateTime type.\")\n    end\nend\n```\nHere's how you can use the `timezone_bumper` function:\n```\njulia> dt = DateTime(2023, 3, 14, 12, 0, 0); # March 14th 12:00 PM UTC+03:00\n\njulia> bump_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 2); # Move the timestamp forward by 2 hours\n\njulia> bump_dt # Output: DateTime(2023, 3, 14, 14, 0, 0) # March 14th 2:00 PM UTC+03:00\n```\nIn this implementation, we first check if the input `dt` is a `DateTime` type using the `isa` function. If it's not a `DateTime`, we throw an error.\n\nThen, we increase the timestamp by the provided `bump` hours using the `DateDiff` function. The `DateDiff` function takes two arguments: the first is the input date or time, and the second is the amount of time to add or subtract (in this case, hours). Finally, we return the new `DateTime` object.\n\nNote that if you provide a `bump` value that is not an integer, the function will raise an error. Also, if you pass in a `dt` value that is not a valid date or time, the function will also raise an error.","status":200,"tokens":[74,461],"elapsed":15.338222917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
