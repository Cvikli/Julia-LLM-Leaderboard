X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Let's get started on solving the problem of timezone bumper function in Julia. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `DateTime` type\n\t* Timezone-related functions such as `zt`, `utcnow`, and `timezone()`\n\t* Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Write a function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)` that takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an integer `bump` as input. The function should increase the timestamp by `bump` hours (defaults to +3 hours).\n\t* Check if the input `dt` is a `Date` type and throw an error.\n\t* Return the modified `DateTime` object.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with various inputs, including dates and times, to ensure it works correctly.\n\nNow, let's dive into the code implementation. Here's the function `timezone_bumper`:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if input is a Date type\n    if dt.isa(\"Date\")\n        error(\"Timezone bumper only works with DateTime types.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Increase the timestamp by the specified amount of hours\n    dt = dt + bump * hour(dt)\n    \n    return dt\nend\n```\nLet's go through the code line by line:\n\n1. `function timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)` - Define a function called `timezone_bumper` that takes two input arguments: `dt` of type `DateTime`, and `bump` of type `Int` (defaults to +3 hours).\n2. `if dt.isa(\"Date\")` - Check if the input `dt` is a `Date` type using the `isa` function. If it is, throw an error with a message explaining that this function only works with `DateTime` types.\n3. `dt = dt + bump * hour(dt)` - Increase the timestamp by the specified amount of hours. The `hour` function returns the number of hours in a day, so multiplying it by `bump` gives us the total number of hours to add to the timestamp.\n4. `return dt` - Return the modified `DateTime` object.\n\nThat's it!
