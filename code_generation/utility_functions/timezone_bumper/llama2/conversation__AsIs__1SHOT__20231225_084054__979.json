Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function:\n```\ndef timezone_bumper(dt: DateTime, bump: int = 3) -> DateTime:\n    if isinstance(dt, Date):\n        raise ValueError(\"Attempting to bump a date\")\n    new_time = dt + timedelta(hours=bump)\n    return new_time\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `dt` (a DateTime object) and `bump` (an integer representing the number of hours to bump the timestamp).\n* We first check if `dt` is a Date object. If it is, we raise a ValueError because we can't bump a date.\n* Otherwise, we create a new DateTime object by adding a `timedelta` object with the value of `bump` hours to the original `dt` object. This will shift the timestamp forward in time by the specified number of hours.\n* Finally, we return the new DateTime object.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```\nprint(timezone_bumper(DateTime.now(), 3)) # Output: DateTime(2023-02-17 14:36:55.823754)\n```\nNote that the function works only for DateTime objects, and it throws an error when passed a Date object. This is because you can't bump a date, as dates are immutable and don't have a concept of time zones.","status":200,"tokens":[57,350],"elapsed":11.629175083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
