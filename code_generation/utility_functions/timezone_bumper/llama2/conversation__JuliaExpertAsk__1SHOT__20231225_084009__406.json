Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's the function you requested:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Union{Nothing,Int})\n    if bump == Nothing\n        # By default, add 3 hours to the timestamp\n        dt += 3 * hour\n    else\n        # Otherwise, add the specified number of hours\n        dt += bump * hour\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `dt` (a `DateTime` type), and `bump` (an optional integer).\n* If `bump` is `Nothing`, the function adds 3 hours to `dt` by default.\n* Otherwise, the function adds the specified number of hours to `dt`.\n\nNote: I assumed that you wanted the function to work only for `DateTime` types, and threw an error for `Date` types. If this is not the case, please let me know and I can modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[103,215],"elapsed":7.601187666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
