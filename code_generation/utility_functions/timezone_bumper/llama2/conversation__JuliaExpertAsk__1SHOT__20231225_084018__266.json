Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a function `timezone_bumper` that does as you described:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if dt == Date()\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"cannot modify date type\"))\n    end\n    return DateTime(dt + bump * hours())\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two arguments `dt` and `bump`.\n* We first check if `dt` is a `Date` type using the `==` operator. If it is, we throw an error using `ArgumentError` because we cannot modify date types.\n* If `dt` is not a `Date` type, we convert it to a `DateTime` type using the `DateTime` constructor and add the specified number of hours to the timestamp using the `+` operator.\n\nNote that I've used the `hours()` function to convert the bump time to hours, as the input `bump` can be any integer value representing hours, minutes, or seconds.","status":200,"tokens":[1,235],"elapsed":7.547590417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
