Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's the function you requested:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isaconvert(dt,Date)\n        throw(ErrorException(\"cannot bump a Date type\"))\n    else\n        dt += bump * hours(dt)\n        return dt\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `dt` (a DateTime object) and `bump` (an integer representing the number of hours to bump the timestamp).\n* We first check if `dt` is a Date type using the `isaconvert()` function. If it is, we throw an error since we can't bump a Date type.\n* Otherwise, we convert `dt` to a DateTime type using the `hours()` function, which returns the number of hours in the timestamp.\n* We then add `bump` hours to the timestamp and return the modified DateTime object.\n\nNote that the default value of `bump` is 3 hours, which is common for many time zones. You can change this default value if needed by changing the line `bump::Int = 3` in the function definition.","status":200,"tokens":[103,268],"elapsed":9.364553542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
