Here's a concise solution in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Union{Int})\n    # Handle default bump of +3 hours\n    bump = bump == nothing ? 3 : bump\n    new_dt = dt + DateDiff(hours)(dt, bump)\n    return new_dt\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes a `dt` (DateTime) and an optional `bump` parameter.\n* If `bump` is nothing (i.e., default value), it defaults to +3 hours.\n* Otherwise, it calculates the difference between `dt` and `bump` in hours using the `DateDiff` function, which returns a `Date` object representing the difference.\n* Finally, the function returns the new timestamp by adding the calculated difference to `dt`.\n\nNote: The function throws an error if `dt` is a `Date` type instead of `DateTime`, as it's not possible to increase a date by hours.","status":200,"tokens":[103,236],"elapsed":8.140637666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
