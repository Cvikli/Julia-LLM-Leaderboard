Here is the function you requested:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3) = dt + bump * hour\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `dt` is a `DateTime` type, which we can operate on directly without worrying about type errors.\n* `bump` is an `Int` representing the number of hours to bump the timestamp by (defaults to +3 hours).\n* The function simply adds `bump` hours to the `dt` time, using the `*` operator to perform multiplication.\n\nNote: I've added a type check on the input parameters to ensure that `dt` is indeed a `DateTime` type and `bump` is an `Int`. If you want to make the function more flexible, you can remove these type checks or modify them as needed.","status":200,"tokens":[103,190],"elapsed":6.762244875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
