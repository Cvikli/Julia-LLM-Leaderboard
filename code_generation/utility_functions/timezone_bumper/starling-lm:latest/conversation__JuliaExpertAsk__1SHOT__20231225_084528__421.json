Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that fulfills the requirements:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if dt isa Date\n        error(\"The input must be of type DateTime\")\n    else\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThis function accepts a `DateTime` object and an optional `Int` argument for the number of hours to bump the timestamp forward (default is 3). It first checks if the input is a `Date` type, and if it is, it throws an error because the function is designed to only work with `DateTime` types. If the input is valid, it adds the specified number of hours to the input using the `Dates.Hour()` function and returns the updated timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[119,190],"elapsed":6.176341541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
