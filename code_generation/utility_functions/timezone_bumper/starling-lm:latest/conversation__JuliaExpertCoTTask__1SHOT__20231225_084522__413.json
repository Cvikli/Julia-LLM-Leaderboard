If a different data type is provided, it throws an error message. The second parameter (defaulting to 3 hours) bumps the date time by that amount. Here's how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump = 3\nprint(timezone_bumper(dt, bump))\n```\n\nThis code will print the date and time of `dt` bumped forward by `bump` hours.","status":200,"tokens":[217,223],"elapsed":7.690806875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
