Define the function `timezone_bumper` that accepts two arguments: `dt` which must be `DateTime` type, and `bump` which is the number of hours to bump (with a default value of `+3`).\n2. Inside the function, check if the provided `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it is not a `DateTime`, the function will throw an error.\n3. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, add the `bump` hours to `dt` and return the updated `DateTime`.\n\nNow, let's write the function and test it with the provided data.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test with the provided data\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\n\nWhen we run the function with the provided data, it should return `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)`, which is 3 hours ahead of the provided `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[181,247],"elapsed":9.46398275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
