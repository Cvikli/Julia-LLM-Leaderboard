Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example of such a function written in Julia, considering that the `DateTime` type and `Date` type are from the Julia standard library:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Invalid argument type: Function accepts DateTime objects only.\"))\nend\n\n# Example usage (assuming the current date and time is 2023-01-01T12:00:00)\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12)\ntry\n    new_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # Should bump the time by 3 hours\n    println(new_dt)  # Outputs 2023-01-01T15:00:00\ncatch e\n    println(e)\nend\n\n# Example causing an error\nd = Date(2023, 1, 1)\ntry\n    new_d = timezone_bumper(d)\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Outputs the error message for invalid type\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function `timezone_bumper` takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump` with a default value of 3.\n- When the input is of the correct type (`DateTime`), it simply adds `bump` number of hours to the given timestamp.\n- An additional method for the same function name is defined which accepts only `Date` types. This method throws an `ArgumentError` when called, since it's not supposed to process `Date` types.\n- The examples provided show how to call the function with a `DateTime` object and what happens when you try to use a `Date` object. It throws and catches an appropriate error for the `Date` type.\n\nPlease ensure you have the `Dates` module available in your Julia environment, as this function relies on the `DateTime` and `Date` types it provides, as well as the `Hour` function for the time bump operation.","status":200,"tokens":[64,432],"elapsed":49.416016375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
