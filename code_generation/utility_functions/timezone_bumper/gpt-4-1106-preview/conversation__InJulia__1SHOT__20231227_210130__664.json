Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can write such a function by using the `DateTime` functions provided by the standard library to manipulate datetimes and add hours. Here is how you could define the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Dispatch error for Date types\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(MethodError(timezone_bumper, (dt, bump)))\nend\n```\nThis function first defines how to handle `DateTime` objects, increasing the provided `DateTime` by the specified number of hours, which defaults to 3 if not provided. The second function definition is for when a `Date` object is passed, which simply throws a `MethodError`, indicating that the `timezone_bumper` function is not meant to handle `Date` objects.\n\nHere's an example of how you would use the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\n# A DateTime to be bumped\nexample_datetime = DateTime(2023, 3, 25, 12) # March 25, 2023, at 12:00\n\n# Increase the DateTime by the default 3 hours\nnew_datetime = timezone_bumper(example_datetime)\n\nprintln(new_datetime) # This will print the new bumped DateTime\n\n# Trying to bump a Date should throw an error\nexample_date = Date(2023, 3, 25) # March 25, 2023\n\n# This will cause an error because timezone_bumper does not handle Date types\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(example_date)\ncatch e\n    println(e)\nend\n```\n\nMake sure to use the `using Dates` statement at the beginning of your script or in the Julia REPL to have access to the required `DateTime` and `Date` types and their associated functions.","status":200,"tokens":[67,392],"elapsed":41.069085125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
