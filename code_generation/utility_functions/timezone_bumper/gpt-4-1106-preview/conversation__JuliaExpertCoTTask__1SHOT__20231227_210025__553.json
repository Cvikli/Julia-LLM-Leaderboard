Add `bump` hours to the `dt` variable and return the new `DateTime`.\n\nNow, I will write the necessary code to accomplish this. \n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Testing the function with provided data\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(new_dt)\n\n# Error testing for Date type\ntry\n    timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\ncatch e\n    println(e)\nend\n```\n\nThe provided timestamp `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)` will be increased by 3 hours, resulting in `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)`. The error part will throw a method error since the `timezone_bumper` function requires a `DateTime` type and not a `Date` type.","status":200,"tokens":[181,275],"elapsed":15.786613,"_type":"aimessage"}]
