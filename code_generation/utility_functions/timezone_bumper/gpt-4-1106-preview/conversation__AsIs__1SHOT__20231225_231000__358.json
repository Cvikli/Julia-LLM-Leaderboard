Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! You're asking for a function in a language that seems to be inspired by Julia's syntax. Below is the Julia function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)::DateTime\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Throw an error for Date types\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper requires a DateTime, not a Date\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this Julia function, `timezone_bumper` is defined to only accept a `DateTime` type as the first argument. It uses the `Dates` module to manipulate the DateTime objects. It will increase the provided `DateTime` by `bump` hours, which by default is set to 3 if not specified.\n\nWhen you try to pass a `Date` object, it will throw an error. Juliaâ€™s method dispatch system will ensure that the correct function is called based on the type of the first argument.\n\nHere is how you can use the function:\n\n```julia\n# Assume that 'now' is a DateTime object\nnow = DateTime(2023, 3, 14, 12)\n\n# Increase by the default 3 hours\nthree_hours_later = timezone_bumper(now)\nprintln(three_hours_later)\n\n# Increase by a custom number of hours\nsix_hours_later = timezone_bumper(now, 6)\nprintln(six_hours_later)\n\n# Below should cause an error since 'today' is a Date object\ntoday = Date(2023, 3, 14)\n# timezone_bumper(today) # Uncommenting this will throw an error\n```\n\nPlease replace `println` statements with the appropriate usage as per your requirements. Keep in mind this is designed for Julia and might not work if you're using a different programming language.","status":200,"tokens":[64,385],"elapsed":16.133117,"_type":"aimessage"}]
