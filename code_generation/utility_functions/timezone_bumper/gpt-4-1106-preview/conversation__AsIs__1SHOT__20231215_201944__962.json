Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example of a function written in Julia that increases a given `DateTime` object by a specified number of hours. If the input is a `Date` object, it will throw an error.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Overload the function to throw an error for Date types\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper function only accepts DateTime objects, not Date\"))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 12) # April 1st, 2023 at 12:00\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # Should return April 1st, 2023 at 15:00\n\n# This will throw an error\nd = Date(2023, 4, 1)\nnew_d = timezone_bumper(d) # Should raise an ArgumentError\n```\n\nIn this code, we define the `timezone_bumper` function with two methods: one that accepts a `DateTime` object and another that accepts a `Date` object. The first method adds the specified number of hours to the `DateTime` object, while the second method throws an `ArgumentError` if a `Date` object is passed.\n\nPlease note that this code is written for the Julia programming language. If you need the function in a different programming language, please let me know, and I can provide an equivalent function in that language.","status":200,"tokens":[64,325],"elapsed":27.377169834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
