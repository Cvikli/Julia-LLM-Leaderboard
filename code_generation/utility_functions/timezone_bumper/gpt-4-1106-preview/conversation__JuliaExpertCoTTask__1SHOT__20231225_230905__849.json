If it is of `Date` type, throw an error.\n5. Check that the solution works with an example.\n\nNow let's write the code for it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3) # bump is 3 by default.\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int) # This method will catch Date instances and raise an error.\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"The input must be a DateTime, not a Date.\"))\nend\n\n# Example usage:\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```\n\nThis should return a new `DateTime` which is 3 hours ahead of the provided timestamp. Let's check that it is correct. \n\nGiven `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)` and a bump of 3 hours, the result should be `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)`.","status":200,"tokens":[181,282],"elapsed":11.387050833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
