Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a sample implementation in Julia that creates a `timezone_bumper` function, which accepts a timestamp (`dt`) and an optional number of hours to be bumped (`bump`, which defaults to 3 hours). The function will add the specified number of hours to a given `DateTime` and will throw an error if a `Date` object is passed instead.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# This method will throw an error if a Date object is passed\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper function requires a DateTime object, but a Date was passed\"))\nend\n\n# Example of usage\n# Given a DateTime object `dt_example`, bump the timezone by 1 hour\ndt_example = DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 12, 0)  # For example, April 1st, 2023, 12:00 PM\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt_example, 1)\n\nprintln(\"Original DateTime: \", dt_example)\nprintln(\"Bumped DateTime: \", new_dt)\n\n# Example of incorrect usage with a Date object, should throw an error\ndate_example = Date(2023, 4, 1)\n# This should result in an error\ntry\n    new_date = timezone_bumper(date_example)\ncatch e\n    println(\"An error occurred: \", e)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, there are two methods for `timezone_bumper`:\n\n1. The first takes a `DateTime` object and an integer number of hours to bump, defaulting to 3 if not otherwise specified.\n2. The second method takes a `Date` object and behaves the same way. However, instead of performing the bump, it throws an `ArgumentError` to indicate that the function expects a `DateTime` object.\n\nNote that this code relies on the `Dates` module, which needs to be available in your Julia environment. You can include this module with `using Dates` at the start of your code if necessary.","status":200,"tokens":[64,445],"elapsed":14.541122417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
