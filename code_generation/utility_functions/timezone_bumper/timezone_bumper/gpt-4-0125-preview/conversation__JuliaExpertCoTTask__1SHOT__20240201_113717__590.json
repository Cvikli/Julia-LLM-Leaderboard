If not, throw an error.\n   - If it's a DateTime, then add `bump` hours to it.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n   Here's the function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check if `dt` is of type DateTime, if not, it'll automatically throw a MethodError due to type specification\n\n    # Add `bump` hours to the input DateTime\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Custom function for Date types to showcase the error\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Function accepts DateTime types only.\"))\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n   Here, we have the data `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)` and a `bump` of 3 hours. By applying the provided function:\n\n```julia\nresult = timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\nThe expected output would be a DateTime object representing `2023-04-10 15:00`, indicating the function correctly added 3 hours to the provided timestamp.\n\nLet's execute the plan.","status":200,"tokens":[181,325],"elapsed":20.215668708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
