Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can accomplish this task by defining a function that checks the type of the input and uses the `Dates` module to increase the `DateTime` by the specified number of hours. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n\"\"\"\n    timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n\nIncreases the `DateTime` `dt` by `bump` hours. Throws an error if a `Date` type is passed.\n\n# Arguments\n- `dt::DateTime`: The datetime object to be increased.\n- `bump::Int`: The number of hours to increase `dt` by. Defaults to 3.\n\n# Returns\n- `DateTime`: The new datetime increased by `bump` hours.\n\n# Examples\n```jldoctest\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 12, 0), 2)\n2023-04-01T14:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 1, 12, 0))\n2023-04-01T15:00:00\n```\n\"\"\"\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Overloading the function to throw an error for Date types\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper function only supports DateTime types, not Date.\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We first import the `Dates` module, which contains the necessary types and operations to work with dates and times in Julia.\n- The function `timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)` is defined to only take a `DateTime` object as its first argument and an optional integer `bump` as its second argument, with a default value of 3. This function simply returns a new `DateTime` that is `bump` hours ahead of the provided `dt`.\n- By using the `+` operator with `DateTime` and `Hour`, we effectively increase the hours of the given timestamp without changing the other components (unless, of course, the addition results in rolling over to a new day, month, etc.).\n- We also overload the `timezone_bumper` function to accept a `Date` type, but instead of performing any operation, it throws an `ArgumentError` to handle cases where a `Date` object is mistakenly passed to the function. This ensures that the function \"works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types,\" as requested.\n\nThis approach effectively provides robust functionality with clear error handling for unsupported types.","status":200,"tokens":[67,556],"elapsed":36.752696583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
