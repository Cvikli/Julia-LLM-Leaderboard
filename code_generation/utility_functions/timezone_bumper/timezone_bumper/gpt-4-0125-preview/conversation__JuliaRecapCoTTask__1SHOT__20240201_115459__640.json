Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

We will also need to ensure the function discriminates between `DateTime` objects (to which it will apply the operation) and `Date` objects (for which it will throw an error). Julia's `Dates` module provides the necessary functionality for this. Let's proceed to solve the task given these considerations.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\nTo approach this problem, we will follow the steps below:\n\n1. Import the `Dates` module, as it contains necessary functionalities for date and time manipulation.\n2. Define the function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)` that checks the type of the provided `dt` parameter.\n3. If `dt` is of type `DateTime`, the function will proceed to add the specified number of hours to it. We use the `Dates.Hour()` function for this purpose.\n4. If `dt` is of type `Date`, the function will throw an error indicating that the operation is not applicable.\n\nLet's put this plan into code.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n\"\"\"\n    timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n\nIncreases the `DateTime` object `dt` by `bump` hours. Throws an error if `dt` is a `Date` object.\n\"\"\"\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Overload for `Date` type to throw a specific error.\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper is only applicable to DateTime objects, not Date objects.\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines the required function that performs differently based on the type of its `dt` argument, adhering to Julia's multiple dispatch feature to differentiate between `DateTime` and `Date` objects, applying the operation only to the former and raising an error for the latter.\n\n### Double-check the Solution\n\nTo ensure correctness, let's outline some checks:\n\n1. The function should correctly bump a `DateTime` object by the default and specified hours.\n2. Attempting the function with a `Date` object should raise the intended error.\n\nWe would verify this by applying the function to both `DateTime` and `Date` objects in a Julia environment and observing if the outcomes align with these expectations.","status":200,"tokens":[325,502],"elapsed":34.3683535,"_type":"aimessage"}]
