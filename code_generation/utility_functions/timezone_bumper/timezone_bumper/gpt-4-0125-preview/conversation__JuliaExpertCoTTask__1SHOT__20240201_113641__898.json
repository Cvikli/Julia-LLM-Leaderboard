Verify if the provided `dt` is an instance of DateTime. If not, throw an error.\n2. Increase the timestamp `dt` by `bump` hours using the appropriate method or operator.\n3. Return the updated `dt`.\n\n### Write any functions and other code you need\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\n### Solve the task\nGiven the data `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)`, the function should increase the DateTime by 3 hours.\n\n### Check that your solution is correct\nNow, I'll demonstrate the function with the provided data example and also test it with a Date type to ensure it throws an error as expected.\n\n```julia\n# Correct data type example\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3))\n\n# Incorrect data type example to test the error handling\ntry\n    println(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3))\ncatch e\n    println(e)  # Expecting an error message\nend\n```\n\nThis completes the task following the provided steps.","status":200,"tokens":[181,313],"elapsed":14.524910666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
