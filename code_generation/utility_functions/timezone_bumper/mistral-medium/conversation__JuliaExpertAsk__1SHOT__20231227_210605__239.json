If it is, the function increases the timestamp by `bump` hours (defaults to 3 hours). If it's not, the function throws an error indicating that `dt` must be of type `DateTime`. Note that this function does not handle the case where the input `bump` is not an integer. If you want to enforce that `bump` is an integer, you can modify the function signature to `function timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int)`.","status":200,"tokens":[111,209],"elapsed":13.925453958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
