If it's not and is instead of the `Date` type, it throws an error. If `dt` is of the correct type, the function adds `bump` hours to the input timestamp using the `Dates.Hour()` constructor and returns the result. By default, `bump` is set to 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[111,177],"elapsed":3.97186225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
