It then checks if the input `dt` is indeed of type `DateTime`. If it is, the function returns a new `DateTime` object with the time bumped by `bump` hours. If the input is not of type `DateTime`, the function throws an `ArgumentError` with an appropriate message.\n\nNote that the `Dates` module is used to create a duration of `bump` hours, which is then added to the input `DateTime` object. The `DateTime` constructor is used to create the new `DateTime` object with the bumped time.","status":200,"tokens":[111,241],"elapsed":7.672585542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
