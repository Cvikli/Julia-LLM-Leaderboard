[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Solution:\n\nGiven the task and special instructions, we can directly proceed to writing a function that will add hours to a DateTime type and throw an error if the input is of Date type. Here's how the Julia code would look like:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Integer)\n    return dt + Duration(bump * 3600)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Integer)\n    throw(\"Invalid input: Timezone bumper only works with DateTime type.\")\nend\n```\n\nThe first function is for the DateTime type where we add `bump` hours to the provided `DateTime` object. The second function is used when `dt` is of Date type, which throws an error stating that the timezone_bumper only works with DateTime type. \n\nRemember, in Julia, the default value for `bump` will be +3 hours because we have specified the type as `Integer`. If you want to make this more explicit, you can add a default argument as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Integer; bumper_hours=3)\n    return dt + Duration(bump * 3600 * bumper_hours)\nend\n```\nThis will add `bump` hours * `bumper_hours` to the time.","status":200,"tokens":[382,321],"elapsed":11.70321325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
