Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if input is a DateTime type\n    if isnothing(dt.date)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Invalid input: must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate the new timestamp by adding the bump hours\n    new_dt = dt + bump * hour(dt.timezone)\n    \n    return new_dt\nend\n```\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```julia\n# Create a DateTime object with the current time in New York City\ndt = DateTime(\"2023-02-28 14:30:00 EDT\")\n\n# Bump the timestamp by 3 hours (UTC time)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\n\n# Print the new timestamp\nprintln(new_dt)\n```\nThe `isnothing` function is used to check if the input `dt` is a `DateTime` type. If it's not, an error is thrown. The `hour` function is used to calculate the number of hours in the timezone of `dt`. Finally, the `+` operator is used to add the bump hours to the original timestamp `dt`.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input timestamp is in UTC time. If you need to handle timestamps in different timezones, you may want to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[74,349],"elapsed":11.737201958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
