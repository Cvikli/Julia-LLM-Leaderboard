If it's `Date`, it throws an error with a clear message indicating that the input must be of type `DateTime`. Otherwise, it increases the timestamp by the number of seconds corresponding to `bump::Int` hours (which is 3 by default).","status":200,"tokens":[117,165],"elapsed":5.409209584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
