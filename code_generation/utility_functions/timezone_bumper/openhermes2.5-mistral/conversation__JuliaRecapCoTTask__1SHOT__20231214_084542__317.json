[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

I'm excited to help you with your Julia programming task. Before we dive into solving the problem, let me quickly review some key aspects of the Julia language to ensure we're on the same page:\n\n1. Key Syntax:\n\t* Variables: `x = 10`\n\t* Control structures: `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`\n\t* Functions: `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`\n\t* Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested.\n\t* Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive.

Please provide the timestamp `dt` and the bump amount `bump`, and I will write the function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)`.","status":200,"tokens":[11,318],"elapsed":11.439235375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
