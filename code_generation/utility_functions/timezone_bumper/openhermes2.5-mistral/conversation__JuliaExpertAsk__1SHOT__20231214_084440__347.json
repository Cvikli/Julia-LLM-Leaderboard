Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a possible implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function:\n```\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Handle Date types\n    if isnothing(dt) || !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Only DateTime types are supported\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Bump the timestamp by the specified number of hours\n    dt += bump * DateDiff(hours)(dt)\nend\n```\nThis function takes a `dt` parameter of type `DateTime`, and an optional `bump` parameter of type `Int`. It first checks if the input `dt` is nothing or not a `DateTime`, and throws an error if it's not. Then, it bumps the timestamp by the specified number of hours using the `DateDiff` function, which calculates the difference between two dates in hours.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `bump` parameter is positive, and will increase the timestamp by the specified number of hours. If you want to decrease the timestamp, you can pass a negative value for `bump`.","status":200,"tokens":[103,245],"elapsed":8.580266459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
