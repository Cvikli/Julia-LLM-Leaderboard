When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can define a function named `timezone_bumper` in Julia as follows:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)  # Default value of `bump` is 3 hours.\n    if dt isa DateTime\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)   # Increase the timestamp by `bump` hours.\n    elseif dt isa Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Date types are not supported\"))  # Throw an error for Date types.\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks whether the input `dt` is a `DateTime` type or not. If it is, then it increases the timestamp by the number of hours provided in `bump` (which defaults to 3 if no value is specified). If the input `dt` is a `Date` type, it throws an error as we're not supporting date types at this time.\n\nYou can test the function with your data like so:\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3))\n```\n\nThis should print `2023-04-10T15:00:00` which is the original timestamp increased by 3 hours. If you were to try it with a Date type instead of DateTime, like so:\n\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3))\n```\n\nYou should receive an `ArgumentError` stating \"Date types are not supported\".","status":200,"tokens":[212,367],"elapsed":88.696305833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
