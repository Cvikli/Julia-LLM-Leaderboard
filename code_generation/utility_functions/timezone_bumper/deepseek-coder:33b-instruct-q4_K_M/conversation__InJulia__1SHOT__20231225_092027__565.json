Here is a function that does what you want:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        error(\"This function only works for DateTime types\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We first import the Dates module.\n- We define a function named `timezone_bumper` which takes two arguments, `dt::DateTime` and `bump::Int` (defaults to 3).\n- Inside the function, we check if `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, an error message is printed.\n- Then, we return a new DateTime object that is `bump` hours later than `dt` using the `+` operator and `Hour()` constructor. \n\nPlease note that Julia's DateTime handling capabilities are quite extensive and this solution is just a simple example. For more complex date/time manipulations, you may want to consider using packages like Dates and TimeZones.","status":200,"tokens":[73,263],"elapsed":43.673244709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
