It returns the input DateTime object advanced by the specified number of hours (defaults to 3). The second function takes a Date object and an integer as arguments, but instead of advancing it, throws an error. This is because there's no standard way to \"bump\" a Date, as Dates don't include time information.","status":200,"tokens":[114,179],"elapsed":31.254787417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
