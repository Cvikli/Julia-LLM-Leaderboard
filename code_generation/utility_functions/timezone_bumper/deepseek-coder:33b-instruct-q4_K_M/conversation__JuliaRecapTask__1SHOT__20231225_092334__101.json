[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a simple solution using Julia's Dates module. This function accepts a DateTime object and an integer value as arguments, and returns a new DateTime with the bumped hour. If a Date is provided instead of a DateTime, it throws an error:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime,bump::Int=3) \n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date, bump::Int=3) \n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only accepts DateTime objects.\"))\nend\n```\n\nPlease note: The second method of the function will throw an ArgumentError if a Date is passed to this function. It's important to handle all possible inputs correctly for good code practice and readability. \n\nAlso, please note that Dates module has been deprecated since Julia v1.0. For newer versions of Julia, consider using TimeZones or ZonedDateTime packages instead.","status":200,"tokens":[400,222],"elapsed":46.120512458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
