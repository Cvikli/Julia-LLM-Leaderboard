[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function that fits your task:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    if dt isa DateTime # check if argument is a DateTime type\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump) # increase the given DateTime by 'bump' hours\n    elseif dt isa Date # check if argument is a Date type\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Cannot bump a date, please provide a DateTime instead\")) # throw an error\n    else \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Invalid input. Please provide a DateTime or Date.\")) # throw an error for invalid types\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function accepts two arguments: `dt` and `bump`, where `dt` is the date/time that you want to bump, and `bump` is the number of hours you wish to add. If no value is provided for `bump` it defaults to +3 hours.\n\nThe function checks if `dt` is a DateTime or Date type. It uses a conditional (if-elseif) structure to perform different operations depending on the type of `dt`: \n- If `dt` is a DateTime, it increases the time by `bump` hours using the Dates package's Hour function and returns the new DateTime.\n- If `dt` is a Date, an error message is thrown as you cannot bump a date in this way.\n- If `dt` is neither of these types (it could be any other type), another error message is thrown because it cannot perform the operation on this type of argument. \n  \nPlease make sure to include Dates package before using timezone_bumper function:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```","status":200,"tokens":[402,384],"elapsed":73.067815709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
