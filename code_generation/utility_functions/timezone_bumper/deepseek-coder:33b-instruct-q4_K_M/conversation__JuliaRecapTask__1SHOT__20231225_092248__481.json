[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Here's how you could implement your function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    try \n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    catch e\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type. $e\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` which should be a `DateTime` object, and `bump` which is the number of hours to bump the time forward by (default +3). If `dt` is not a `DateTime` object, it throws an error. It uses the `try-catch` block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the computation and rethrow them as `ArgumentError` with custom message.\n\nPlease note: You need to have the `Dates` package installed in your Julia environment. If it's not already, you can install it using Julia's built-in package manager (Pkg):\n```julia\nusing Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Dates\")\n```","status":200,"tokens":[400,258],"elapsed":51.953004708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
