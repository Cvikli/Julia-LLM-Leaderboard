The output should look something like this:\n\n```julia\nBefore bumping: 2022-11-6T9:57:24.5\nAfter bumping: 2022-11-6T12:57:24.5\n```\nThe error handling is also taken care of here - if a Date object instead of a DateTime object is passed to the function, an error will be thrown.","status":200,"tokens":[70,309],"elapsed":51.044415917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
