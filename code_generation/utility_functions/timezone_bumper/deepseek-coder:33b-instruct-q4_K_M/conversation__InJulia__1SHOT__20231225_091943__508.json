Here is a function that accomplishes what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    if dt isa DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif dt isa Date  # we can skip this check since `Date` isn't a subtype of `DateTime`\n        error(\"Can only perform operation on DateTime types\")\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a `DateTime` object and an integer to bump the timezone. If the first argument is not a `DateTime`, it throws an error. It's important to note that Julia doesn't support subclassing as in other languages, so we can't check if a `Date` is a subtype of `DateTime` (which would allow us to throw the same error for both types). Instead, we simply perform the operation on `DateTime` and throw an error for `Date`.","status":200,"tokens":[73,237],"elapsed":39.481121291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
