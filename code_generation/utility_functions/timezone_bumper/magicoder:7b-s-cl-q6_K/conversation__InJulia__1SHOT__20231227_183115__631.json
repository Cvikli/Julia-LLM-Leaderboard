Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, the built-in functionality to perform datetime manipulation is through the `Dates` package. Below is how you can write a function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)` that fulfills your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump::Int=3)\n    # check if dt is of DateTime type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime) \n        error(\"Provided argument is not a DateTime type.\")\n    end\n    \n    # increase the time by bump hours\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- It first checks if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If it's not, an error will be thrown.\n- Then, it adds a duration of `bump` hours to `dt` and returns the result. The default value for `bump` is 3 hours.\n\nThis function can be used as follows:\n```julia\njulia> dt = now()\n2022-11-25T16:48:29.516\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2022-11-25T19:48:29.516\n```\nNote that the function will work correctly only with `DateTime` types, because adding hours to a `Date` type doesn't make sense and it will throw an error if such input is provided.","status":200,"tokens":[74,344],"elapsed":17.75068625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
