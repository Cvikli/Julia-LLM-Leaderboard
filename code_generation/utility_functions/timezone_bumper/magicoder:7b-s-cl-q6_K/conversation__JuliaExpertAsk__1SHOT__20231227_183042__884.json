The default value of the second parameter is set to 3, but you can change it as per your requirement. The function returns the original DateTime object increased by the specified number of hours.\n\nThe `@timeit \"test\"` block of code is used to measure how long the operation takes. This is useful for performance benchmarking purposes. You can remove or modify this part if you do not need it.\n\nIf you try to pass a Date type, Julia will throw an error because our function only works with DateTime types:\n\n```julia\nd = now()  # get current time\nprintln(\"Original Time: \",d)\nnew_d = timezone_bumper(Date(2021,1,1))   # attempt to bump it by 2 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[113,324],"elapsed":16.98801325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
