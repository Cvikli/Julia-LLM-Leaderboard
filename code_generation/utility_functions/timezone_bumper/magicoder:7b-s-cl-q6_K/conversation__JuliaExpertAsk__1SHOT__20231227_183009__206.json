If no argument is supplied for bump, it defaults to 3 hours.\n- It then adds the number of hours specified in the bump parameter to the provided datetime object.\n- If Date type is passed instead of DateTime, then it will throw an error indicating that this function does not support Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[113,185],"elapsed":10.548481083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
