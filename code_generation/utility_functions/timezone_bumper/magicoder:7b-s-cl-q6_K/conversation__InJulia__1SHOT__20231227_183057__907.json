If not, it throws an error. Afterwards, it increases the time by `bump::Int` hours and returns the updated timestamp.\n\nHere's how you would do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of type DateTime.\"))\n    end\n    \n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function will increase the provided timestamp by `bump` hours and return it. If you provide a value that is not of type `DateTime`, it will throw an error.\n\nFor example, if you call this function with a DateTime like so:\n\n```julia\ndt = now() # current date and time\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # bumps by 3 hours\n```\n\nYou can also specify the number of hours to bump by passing an additional argument:\n\n```julia\ndt = now()\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 4) # bumps by 4 hours\n```","status":200,"tokens":[74,289],"elapsed":14.971685041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
