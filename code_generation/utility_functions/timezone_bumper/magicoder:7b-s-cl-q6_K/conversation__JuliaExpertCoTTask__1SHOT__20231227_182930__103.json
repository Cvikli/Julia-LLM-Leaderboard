The first parameter is the date-time object that you want to manipulate, and the second parameter is the number of hours by which you want to increase or decrease the time. \n\nThe function throws an error if the input date-time is not a DateTime type. If it's a Date type, it also throws an error, since we specifically asked for a DateTime object in the problem statement.\n\nThe `bump` parameter defaults to +3 hours but you can override this by passing another value when calling the function. \n\nHere's how you would use this function:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump_time = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[211,304],"elapsed":16.618561292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
