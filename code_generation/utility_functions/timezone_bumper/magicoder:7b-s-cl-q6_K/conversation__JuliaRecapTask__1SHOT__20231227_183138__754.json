[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It then returns the original DateTime object incremented by the number of hours specified in the `bump` argument, with a default value of 3.\n\nNote that this function only works with DateTime types and throws an error for Date types. This is because the function uses Dates.jl's built-in addition operator (+) to add hours to the DateTime object. The addition operation isn't defined for Date objects, hence we throw an error when a Date object is passed as an argument. \n\nAlso remember that Julia uses 1-based indexing (unlike Python which defaults to 0-based indexing), so if you want to bump forward by 3 hours, you should give the `bump` value of 3 (not 2 or 4).","status":200,"tokens":[374,285],"elapsed":16.693463458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
