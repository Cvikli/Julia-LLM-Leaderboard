Here's why:\n1. The function takes one required positional argument (`dt`), followed by two keyword arguments (`; bump::Int=3`). \n2. It checks whether `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, it will throw an error because `DateTime` is the only accepted type.\n3. Inside the function body, we use the `+` operator between `dt` and `Hour(bump)`, which is a common way to increase or decrease a DateTime by a specific number of hours.","status":200,"tokens":[113,290],"elapsed":15.252755667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
