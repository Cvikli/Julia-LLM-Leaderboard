If no bump is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. The function checks the type of dt. If dt is a DateTime object (which inherently includes Time), it adds bump hours to dt and returns the result. If dt is not a DateTime but is instead a Date (i.e., lacks time information), an error is thrown with the message \"Input must be of type DateTime, not Date.\"\n\nYou can test this function using your example:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump_time = timezone_bumper(dt,3)\n```\n`bump_time` would now be `2023-04-10T15:00:00`.","status":200,"tokens":[211,284],"elapsed":15.6495785,"_type":"aimessage"}]
