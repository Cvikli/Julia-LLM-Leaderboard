Define the function `timezone_bumper` with two arguments: a DateTime and an integer bump (defaulting to 3 hours).\n2. Check if the input is of DateTime type; if not, throw an error.\n3. Add the bump value to the input DateTime in hours.\n4. Return the adjusted DateTime.\n\nHere's the Julia code for this function:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be of DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    newtime = dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    \n    return newtime\nend\n```\n\nNow let's test the function with the provided example:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nresult = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nDateTime(2023-04-10T15:00:00.000)\n```\nAs expected, the function added 3 hours to the input DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[217,296],"elapsed":18.752011167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
