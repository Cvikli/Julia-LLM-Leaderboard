When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nHere's a function `timezone_bumper` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours):\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n# Tests\n\nTo test the function, we can use the following code:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n@testset \"timezone_bumper\" begin\n    @test timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3) == DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n    @test timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)) == DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n    @test_throws MethodError timezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10), 3)\nend\n```\n# Explanation\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments: a `DateTime` object and an integer representing the number of hours to bump. The function returns a new `DateTime` object that is the result of adding the specified number of hours to the input `DateTime`.\n\nThe function uses the `Dates` module to perform the calculation, specifically the `Hour` constructor to create a duration object that represents the desired time interval.\n\nThe test set includes three tests: one that verifies the correct behavior for a valid input, another that verifies the default value of 3 hours when no bump value is provided, and finally a test that verifies that an error is thrown when trying to use the function with a `Date` object.","status":200,"tokens":[0,425],"elapsed":11.9008096,"_type":"aimessage"}]
