It first checks that `dt` is a `DateTime` object, and if it's not, it throws an error. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, it adds the specified number of hours to it and returns the resulting `DateTime`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2019, 1, 1, 0)\n2019-01-01T00:00:00\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\n2019-01-01T05:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":7.347077306,"_type":"aimessage"}]
