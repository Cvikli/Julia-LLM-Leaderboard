The function takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. `dt` is a DateTime type, while `bump` is an integer that represents the number of hours to add to `dt`.\n2. The function uses the `Dates.Hour` method to add the specified number of hours to `dt`. This method takes two arguments: the first is the DateTime object (`dt`), and the second is the number of hours to add (`bump`).\n3. The function returns the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt`.\n4. To test the function, we can call it with a DateTime object and an integer value for `bump`, like this: `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)`. This will add 3 hours to the specified DateTime object.\n\nNote that this function only works with DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":7.341367143,"_type":"aimessage"}]
