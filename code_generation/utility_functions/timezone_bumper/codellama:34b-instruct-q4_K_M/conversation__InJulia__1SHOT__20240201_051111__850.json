Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the code for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        error(\"Invalid input. dt must be of type DateTime.\")\n    end\n\n    # Increase the timestamp by bump hours\n    return DateTime(year(dt), month(dt), day(dt), hour(dt) + bump, minute(dt), second(dt))\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `dt`, which is a `DateTime` object representing the timestamp to be bumped, and `bump`, which is an integer indicating the number of hours by which to bump the timestamp (defaults to 3 hours).\n2. We first check if `dt` is actually a `DateTime` type using the `isa` function. If it's not, we throw an error. This is important because we only want to work with `DateTime` types in this function.\n3. Next, we use the `DateTime` constructor to create a new `DateTime` object that represents the bumped timestamp. We do this by taking the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second components of the original `dt` object and adding the number of hours specified in `bump`.\n4. Finally, we return the newly constructed `DateTime` object.\n\nNote that if you try to call this function with a `Date` type instead of a `DateTime` type, it will throw an error because we're checking for `DateTime` types inside the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":10.532084206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
