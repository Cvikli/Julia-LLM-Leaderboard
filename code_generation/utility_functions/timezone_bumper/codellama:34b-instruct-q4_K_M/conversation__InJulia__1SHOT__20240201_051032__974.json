Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    # Check that dt is a valid DateTime type\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The input argument must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    \n    # Increase the timestamp by the specified number of hours\n    new_dt = dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    \n    return new_dt\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which is a `DateTime` object representing the timestamp to be increased, and `bump`, which is an integer representing the number of hours to increase the timestamp by (defaults to 3). The function returns a new `DateTime` object representing the increased timestamp.\n\nThe function first checks that the input argument `dt` is a valid `DateTime` type using the `isa` function. If it is not, an error is thrown.\n\nThen, the function increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours using the `Dates.Hour` function, which adds a given number of hours to a `DateTime` object. The result is returned as a new `DateTime` object.\n\nHere's an example of how this function can be used:\n```\njulia> dt = DateTime(2023, 3, 14, 15, 30, 0)\n2023-03-14T15:30:00.000\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\n2023-03-14T20:30:00.000\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":11.038053667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
