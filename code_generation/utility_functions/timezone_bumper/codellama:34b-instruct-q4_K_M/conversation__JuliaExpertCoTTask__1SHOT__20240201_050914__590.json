This function takes a `DateTime` object and returns a new `DateTime` object with the added hour.\n\nWe can test this function by passing it a `DateTime` object:\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\n2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\nAs expected, the timestamp has been increased by 3 hours.\n\nTo ensure that this function works only for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types, we can add a type assertion to the function definition:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)::DateTime\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nNow if we try to pass a `Date` object to this function, it will throw an error:\n```julia\njulia> date = Date(2023, 4, 10)\njulia> timezone_bumper(date)\nERROR: MethodError: no method matching timezone_bumper(::Date)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,385],"elapsed":10.881413725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
