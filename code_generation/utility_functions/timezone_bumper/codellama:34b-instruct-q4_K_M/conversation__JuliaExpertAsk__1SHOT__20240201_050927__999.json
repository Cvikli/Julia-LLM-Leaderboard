The `DateTime` type is used to represent a timestamp, and the `Hour` type is used to represent a time interval of one hour. The `+` operator is used to add the specified number of hours to the timestamp.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```julia\njulia> dt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1)\nDateTime(\"2023-01-01T00:00:00\")\n\njulia> timezone_bumper(dt)\nDateTime(\"2023-01-01T03:00:00\")\n```\nNote that the `timezone_bumper` function throws an error if you pass a `Date` object instead of a `DateTime` object, as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[0,262],"elapsed":7.291385426,"_type":"aimessage"}]
