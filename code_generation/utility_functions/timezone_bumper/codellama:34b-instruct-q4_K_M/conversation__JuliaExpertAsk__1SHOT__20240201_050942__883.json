If `dt` is a `DateTime`, the function returns a new `DateTime` with `bump` added to its hour field using the `+` operator. If `dt` is a `Date`, the function throws an error since adding hours does not make sense for dates without time information.","status":200,"tokens":[0,184],"elapsed":5.107564691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
