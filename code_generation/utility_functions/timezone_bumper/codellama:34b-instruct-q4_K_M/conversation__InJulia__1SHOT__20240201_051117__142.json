The `DateTime` type is used to represent a date and time, while the `Date` type is used to represent just a date. The `Hour` function from the `Dates` module is used to add or subtract hours from a timestamp.\n\nAlso, note that I've added a default value of 3 for the `bump` argument, which means that if you call the function without providing a value for `bump`, it will be set to 3 by default.","status":200,"tokens":[0,230],"elapsed":6.369997963,"_type":"aimessage"}]
