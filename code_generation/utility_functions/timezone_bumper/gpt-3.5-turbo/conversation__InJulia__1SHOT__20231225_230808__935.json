Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper can only be used with DateTime types, not Date types\"))\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We first import the `Dates` module to work with date and time types.\n- The `timezone_bumper` function takes two arguments: `dt` and `bump`. `dt` is of type `DateTime` and `bump` is of type `Int`, with a default value of 3 if not provided.\n- Inside the function, we use the `+` operator to add the specified number of hours to the `dt` timestamp. We achieve this using `Hour(bump)`, where `Hour` is a time unit defined in the `Dates` module.\n- We also implement a separate method of `timezone_bumper` for `Date` types. This method will throw an `ArgumentError` with a relevant error message, as `timezone_bumper` is meant to work only with `DateTime` types.\n\nYou can test this function with different DateTime values:\n\n```julia\n# Example Usage\ndt1 = DateTime(2022, 9, 20, 10, 30)  # September 20, 2022, 10:30 AM\ndt2 = DateTime(2022, 9, 20, 22, 0)  # September 20, 2022, 10:00 PM\n\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt1))  # September 20, 2022, 01:30 PM (default bump of +3 hours)\nprintln(timezone_bumper(dt2, 5))  # September 21, 2022, 03:00 AM (bump of +5 hours)\n```\n\nNote that if you try to use `timezone_bumper` with a `Date` type, it will throw an error as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[67,442],"elapsed":6.443971292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
