Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's the implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works for DateTime types\"))\nend\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use the `Dates` module to work with dates and times. The `timezone_bumper` function takes two arguments: `dt` which is the timestamp to be bumped, and `bump` which is the number of hours to increase the timestamp by (defaulting to +3 hours).\n\nThe first method of `timezone_bumper` is for `DateTime` types. It adds the specified number of hours to the `dt` timestamp using the `Hour` type from the `Dates` module.\n\nThe second method of `timezone_bumper` is for `Date` types. It throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that `timezone_bumper` only works for `DateTime` types.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # Increase dt by 5 hours\nprintln(new_dt)  # Output: 2022-01-01T17:00:00\n\ndate = Date(2022, 1, 1)\ntimezone_bumper(date)  # Throws an ArgumentError\n```\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.","status":200,"tokens":[67,344],"elapsed":7.153716917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
