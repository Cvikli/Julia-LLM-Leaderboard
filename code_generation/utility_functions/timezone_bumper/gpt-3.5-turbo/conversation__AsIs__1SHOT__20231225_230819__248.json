Example usage:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndt = DateTime(2021, 10, 31, 12, 0, 0)\nupdated_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 5)\nprintln(updated_dt)  # 2021-10-31T17:00:00\n\nupdated_dt = timezone_bumper(dt)  # defaults to +3 hours\nprintln(updated_dt)  # 2021-10-31T15:00:00\n```\n\nNote that this function will throw an error if you pass a Date object instead of a DateTime object.","status":200,"tokens":[64,234],"elapsed":3.181659125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
