Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The function `timezone_bumper` accepts two arguments: `dt` of type `DateTime` and `bump` of type `Int` with a default value of `3`.\n2. The function uses the `Hour` unit from the `Dates` module to create a duration of `bump` hours.\n3. The `+` operator is used to add the duration to the provided `dt` value.\n4. The updated `DateTime` value is returned as the result.","status":200,"tokens":[102,136],"elapsed":2.396854709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
