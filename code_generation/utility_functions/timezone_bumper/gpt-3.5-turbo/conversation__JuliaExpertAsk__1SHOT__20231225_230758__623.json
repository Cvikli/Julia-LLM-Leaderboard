The `bump` value is used to create the `Hour` duration.\n- We provide an overloaded version of `timezone_bumper` specifically for `dt` of type `Date` which throws a `TypeError` with a descriptive error message to indicate that `timezone_bumper` does not work with `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[102,195],"elapsed":3.370597667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
