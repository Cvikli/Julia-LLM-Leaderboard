If it's not a DateTime, an error will occur because we are trying to add hours to a Date which doesn't make sense. The default value for `bump` is 3 hours.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the Dates module loaded in your script to use DateTime and Hour functionalities.","status":200,"tokens":[124,248],"elapsed":33.107416792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
