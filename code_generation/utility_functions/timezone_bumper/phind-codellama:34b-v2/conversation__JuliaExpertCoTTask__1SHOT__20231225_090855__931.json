So, we first need to import the Dates module before using DateTime.\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n```\nNext, let's define the function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)`. It takes two arguments: a datetime object (`dt`) and an integer value (`bump`). We add the integer number of hours to the datetime object using the `+` operator. \n\nHere is the complete code for the `timezone_bumper` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if dt isa Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"The provided timestamp should be of DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn the function, we first check whether `dt` is an instance of the `Date` type (not `DateTime`). If it is, we throw an ArgumentError. Otherwise, we add `bump` hours to `dt`. The default value for `bump` is 3, but you can supply a different integer if needed.\n\nNow let's test our function with the provided example:\n```julia\nprintln(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)) # should return 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[222,335],"elapsed":45.97553575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
