[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you could implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    if dt isa Date \n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided timestamp must be of type DateTime.\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function accepts a `DateTime` object and an integer number of hours to add to the original date and time. If no hour increment is provided, it defaults to 3 hours. If the input object is of type `Date`, it throws an error, because adding hours only makes sense for full timestamps with hours, minutes, and seconds information.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(2021, 8, 6, 15, 30, 0) # Creates a DateTime object for August 6th, 2021 at 3:30 PM.\ntimezone_bumper(dt)                  # Adds 3 hours to the original timestamp.\n```\n\nThis will return a new `DateTime` object with the timestamp advanced by three hours.","status":200,"tokens":[385,278],"elapsed":43.259600958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
