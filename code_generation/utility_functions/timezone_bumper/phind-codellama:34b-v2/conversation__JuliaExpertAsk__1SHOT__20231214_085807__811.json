Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `timezone_bumper` function:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Convert the input to a timetz type for easier manipulation\n    tzdt = Timestamp(dt.year, dt.month, dt.day, dt.hour, dt.minute, dt.second)\n    \n    # Bump the time by the provided amount of hours\n    new_time = tzdt + bump * Hour()\n    \n    # Convert the new time back to a DateTime type\n    return DateTime(new_time.year, new_time.month, new_time.day, new_time.hour, new_time.minute, new_time.second)\nend\n```\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```julia\n# Create a DateTime object with the current time\ndt = DateTime(now())\n\n# Bump the time by 3 hours\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\n\n# Print the new time\nprintln(new_dt)\n```\nThis function will work only for `DateTime` types and throw an error when passed a `Date` type. The `Hour()` function is used to convert the bump amount into hours, minutes, and seconds.","status":200,"tokens":[103,304],"elapsed":10.571158042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
