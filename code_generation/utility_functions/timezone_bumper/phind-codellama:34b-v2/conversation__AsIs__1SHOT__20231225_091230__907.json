Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution using Python and its datetime library. It should be straightforward to adapt this code for other programming languages or libraries that support similar operations on date/time values.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3):\n    if isinstance(dt, datetime):\n        return dt + timedelta(hours=bump)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Provided object is not a DateTime type.\")\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be the DateTime object to manipulate, and `bump`, which defaults to 3. If `dt` is indeed a datetime object, it adds `bump` hours to it; otherwise, it raises a ValueError.\n\nFor example:\n```python\n>>> dt = datetime(2022, 1, 1, 15, 0)\n>>> print(timezone_bumper(dt))\n2022-01-01 18:00:00\n```\nThis will increase the time by 3 hours (the default value), and:\n```python\n>>> print(timezone_bumper(dt, 5))\n2022-01-01 20:00:00\n```\nThis increases the time by 5 hours. If we try to use a `date` object instead of a `datetime` one, it will raise an error:\n```python\n>>> from datetime import date\n>>> d = date(2022, 1, 1)\n>>> timezone_bumper(d)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 6, in timezone_bumper\nValueError: Provided object is not a DateTime type.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[82,424],"elapsed":54.028014542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
