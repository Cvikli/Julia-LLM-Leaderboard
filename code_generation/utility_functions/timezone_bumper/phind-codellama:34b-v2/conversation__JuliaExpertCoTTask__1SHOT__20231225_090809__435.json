The function should only work with DateTime types and throw an error for Date types.\n\nBelow is the solution for the given task in Julia programming language:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` of type DateTime and `bump` of type Int. The default value for `bump` is set to 3 hours. It checks the input types and increases the given timestamp by `bump` hours. If the provided date is not of DateTime type, it will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[222,206],"elapsed":51.862787,"_type":"aimessage"}]
