Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can define the function `timezone_bumper` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int = 3)\n    error(\"The function works only with DateTime types. A Date type was provided.\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, the function `timezone_bumper` is defined for two different types: `DateTime` and `Date`. For `DateTime`, it adds the specified number of hours to the input date time. For `Date`, it throws an error because the function is not designed to work with `Date` types.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n- The `dt::DateTime` syntax in the function signature indicates that `dt` should be a DateTime object.\n- The `bump::Int = 3` syntax means that `bump` is an integer, and if no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3.\n- The `Dates.Hour(bump)` constructor creates a time period of type `Hour`, which can then be added to the DateTime object using the `+` operator.\n- If a `Date` object is passed into the function, the second definition will be used, which always throws an error.","status":200,"tokens":[85,314],"elapsed":40.262824416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
