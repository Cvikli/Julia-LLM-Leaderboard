It returns a new `DateTime` object that is equal to the original `dt` but with the time increased by the specified number of hours. If the input is not a `DateTime`, an error is thrown.\n\nNote that this function uses the `Dates.Hour` type from the `Dates` module, which represents a period of time in terms of hours. The `+` operator can be used to add or subtract time periods from a `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[103,167],"elapsed":1.435988292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
