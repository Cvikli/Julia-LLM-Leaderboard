[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If it's not, it throws an error with the message \"Invalid timestamp\".\n\nThen, it increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours using the `+` operator and the `Dates.Hour` function from the `Dates` module. The `Dates.Hour` function returns a `Duration` object that represents the given number of hours.\n\nFinally, the function returns the new timestamp with the increased time.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input timestamp is in the UTC timezone. If you need to handle timestamps in other timezones, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,294],"elapsed":2.510171943,"_type":"aimessage"}]
