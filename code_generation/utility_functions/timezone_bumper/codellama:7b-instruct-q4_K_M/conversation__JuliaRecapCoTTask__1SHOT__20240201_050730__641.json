X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n\t* The `DateTime` type is used to represent date and time values in Julia.\n\t* The `+` operator can be used to add hours to a `DateTime` object.\n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)::DateTime\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThe function takes two arguments: a `DateTime` object `dt`, and an optional integer `bump` that represents the number of hours to add to `dt`. The function returns a new `DateTime` object with the added hours.\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with different inputs, such as `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2022, 1, 1), 4)` and `timezone_bumper(DateTime(2022, 1, 1), -4)`.\n\t* Make sure the function works correctly for both positive and negative hour differences.\n\t* Check that the function throws an error when a `Date` object is provided instead of a `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,299],"elapsed":2.55414003,"_type":"aimessage"}]
