The `Dates.Hour` function is used to specify the number of hours to add to the timestamp. The default value of 3 hours is passed as an optional argument with the name `bump`.\n\nAlso, this function only works for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types. This can be done by checking the type of the input parameter using the `isa` function and throwing an error if it's not a `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,165],"elapsed":1.412316178,"_type":"aimessage"}]
