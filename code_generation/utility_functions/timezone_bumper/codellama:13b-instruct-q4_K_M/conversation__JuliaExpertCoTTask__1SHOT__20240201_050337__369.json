The default value for `bump` is 3.\nThe function first checks whether the input argument `dt` is of type `DateTime`. If not, it throws an error. Then, it adds the specified number of hours to the provided timestamp using the `Hour` constructor from the `Dates` module and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,191],"elapsed":2.550572964,"_type":"aimessage"}]
