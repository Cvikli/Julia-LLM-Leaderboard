Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)\n    if !isa(dt,DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Input must be a DateTime type\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which is the timestamp to be bumped up, and an optional argument `bump`, which defaults to 3 hours. The function first checks that `dt` is of type DateTime by using the `isa` function. If it's not, it throws an error with a helpful message indicating that the input must be a DateTime type.\n\nIf `dt` is indeed of type DateTime, then the function returns `dt + Dates.Hour(bump)`, which adds `bump` hours to the timestamp. The `Dates.Hour` function is used to create an object representing a duration of one hour, which can be added to the timestamp using the `+` operator.\n\nNote that this function does not work for Date types because they do not have a time component, so adding a duration of hours would not make sense in that context. If you need to bump up a Date type by 3 hours, you could use the `DateTime` constructor with the appropriate hour, minute, and second arguments.","status":200,"tokens":[0,289],"elapsed":3.816531845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
