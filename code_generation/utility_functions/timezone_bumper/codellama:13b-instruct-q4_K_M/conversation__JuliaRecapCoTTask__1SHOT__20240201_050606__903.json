Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task. One such snippet is the `if` statement, which allows us to conditionally execute code based on a given expression. We also need to use the `isa` function to check if an object is of a specific type, and the `DateTime` and `Date` types to represent date and time values respectively.\n2. Solve the task. To solve this problem, we can define a function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)` that takes in a `DateTime` or `Date` object and an optional `bump` argument (defaulting to 3 hours). We then use an `if-else` statement to check if the input is a `DateTime` type. If it is, we create a new `DateTime` object with the modified time by adding the `bump` value to the original timestamp. If it's not a `DateTime` object, we throw an error.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct. We can test our function by passing in different inputs and verifying that the output is as expected.\n\nHere's the final code:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump = 3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        error(\"Input must be a DateTime type.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 12), 5) # returns DateTime(2022, 1, 1, 17)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,367],"elapsed":5.11411936,"_type":"aimessage"}]
