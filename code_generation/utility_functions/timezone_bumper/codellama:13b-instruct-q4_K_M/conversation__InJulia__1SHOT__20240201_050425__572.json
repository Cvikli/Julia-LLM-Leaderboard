Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) == Date\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Cannot increase a Date object by $bump hours\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt` is a DateTime or Time object, and `bump` is an integer representing the number of hours to add to the date. The default value for `bump` is 3, so if you don't specify it in your code, the function will add 3 hours to the date.\n\nThe function first checks that `dt` is a DateTime object by checking its type with the `typeof()` function. If it's not, the function throws an error using the `ArgumentError()` constructor. This makes sure that the function only works on DateTime objects and doesn't modify other types of data.\n\nOnce the input has been validated, the function adds the specified number of hours to the date using the `+` operator, which is overloaded for DateTime objects. The result is a new DateTime object representing the original date plus the specified number of hours.\n\nTo use this function in your code, you can call it with a DateTime object and an optional argument specifying the number of hours to add, like this:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2023-05-14T15:30:00\")\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 6) # adds 6 hours to dt\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":4.575388627,"_type":"aimessage"}]
