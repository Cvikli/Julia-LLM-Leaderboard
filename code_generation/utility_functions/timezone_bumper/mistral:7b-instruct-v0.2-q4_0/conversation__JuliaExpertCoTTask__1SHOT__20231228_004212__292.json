Then, it adds the given number of hours to the DateTime using the `Hours()` constructor.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump = 3\nnew_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\n\nprintln(\"Original DateTime: $(dt)\")\nprintln(\"New DateTime after adding $(bump) hours: $(new_dt)\")\n```\n\nThe output of this example will be:\n\n```text\nOriginal DateTime: 2023-04-10T12:00:00.000000000\nNew DateTime after adding 3 hours: 2023-04-10T15:00:00.000000000\n```","status":200,"tokens":[208,345],"elapsed":11.663982083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
