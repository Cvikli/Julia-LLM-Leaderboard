[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

I started by recalling the Julia snippets that will be useful for this task: functions, control structures, and the DateTime library.\n2. Next, I wrote the function `timezone_bumper`. The function takes two arguments: `dt` of type `DateTime` and an optional argument `bump` of type `Int` with a default value of 3 hours.\n3. Inside the function, I used an assertion statement (`@assert`) to check if the input `dt` is indeed of type DateTime. If not, it throws an error message.\n4. I then added the desired functionality by using the addition operator (`+`) on the DateTime object `dt` and a Time object with the given number of hours `bump`. This results in a new DateTime object that represents the original timestamp plus the given number of hours.\n5. Finally, I double-checked my solution to ensure it correctly implements the timezone_bumper function according to the task specifications.","status":200,"tokens":[375,305],"elapsed":11.343760125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
