Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create the `timezone_bumper` function, I'll follow the problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Think through the approach:\n   - The function should accept a DateTime type and an integer as arguments.\n   - It should check if the given date time is of type DateTime before performing any operation.\n   - If the provided date time is of type Date, an error should be thrown.\n   - The bump argument can have a default value of +3 hours.\n\n2. Write the code:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, Date)\n        error(\"Invalid argument! Please provide a DateTime type.\")\n    end\n    \n    new_datetime = dt + Hours(bump)\n    return new_datetime\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\nThe code above follows the steps outlined in the problem. It checks if the provided date time is of type DateTime, and if not, throws an error. Otherwise, it adds the given number of hours (with a default value of 3) to the DateTime object using the `Hours` constructor from the `Dates` module.\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct:\nWe can test our function with various inputs and check if our expected results are met. Let's test it with the provided input and some others:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\n# Given input\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)\nbump = 3\nexpected_output = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 15, 0)\n\n# Testing with given input\nresult = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\n@test result == expected_output \"Expected output doesn't match the expected value for given input.\"\n\n# Testing with different inputs\ndt = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 8, 30)\nbump = 5\nexpected_output = DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 13, 30)\n\nresult = timezone_bumper(dt, bump)\n@test result == expected_output \"Expected output doesn't match the expected value for different input.\"\n```\n\nBy following these steps and testing our function with various inputs, we can ensure that it meets the requirements of the problem.","status":200,"tokens":[208,555],"elapsed":23.140943583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
