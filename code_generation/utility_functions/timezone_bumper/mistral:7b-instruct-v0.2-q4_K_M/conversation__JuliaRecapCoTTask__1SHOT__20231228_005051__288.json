[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

We import the `Dates` module since we will be working with `DateTime` and `Hour` types.\n2. Define a function named `timezone_bumper` that accepts two arguments: `dt` of type `DateTime` and an optional `bump` argument of type `Int` with a default value of 3 hours.\n3. Use the `@assert` macro to check if the input argument `dt` is indeed of type `DateTime`. If not, we throw an error with a custom message.\n4. Create a new datetime by adding the number of hours in a `Hour` object to the original `dt` using the `+` operator.\n5. Return the newly created `DateTime`.\n\nThis solution follows best practices in Julia: it uses standard libraries, checks for data types, and has clear error handling.","status":200,"tokens":[377,288],"elapsed":13.494386584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
