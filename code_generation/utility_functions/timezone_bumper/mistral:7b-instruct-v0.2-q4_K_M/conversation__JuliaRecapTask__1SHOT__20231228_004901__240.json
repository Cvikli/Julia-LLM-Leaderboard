[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

The function `timezone_bumper` takes two arguments, a `DateTime` object `dt` and an optional integer argument `bump` with a default value of 3 hours.\n2. The first thing we do is check if the input `dt` is of type `DateTime` and if its eltype (i.e., the element type) is `AbstractDateTime` and equals `DateTime.UTC`. If so, we create a new `DateTime` object by adding the number of hours `bump` to the original timestamp using `Dates.Hours(bump)`.\n3. If the input is not a UTC DateTime object or if its type is not a subtype of `AbstractDateTime`, we throw an error message saying that the function only accepts UTC DateTime objects as inputs.\n4. We use the `using DateTime` statement at the beginning to import the DateTime library, which provides us with the `DateTime`, `Dates`, and other necessary types and functions for working with dates and times in Julia.\n5. We use type annotations (`DateTime`, `Int`) and optional argument syntax to make our function clearer and more flexible.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this solution or if there's anything else I can help you with!","status":200,"tokens":[375,411],"elapsed":18.463934584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
