X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the given special instructions, here are the steps to write the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Control structures: `if`, `else`.\n   - Type checking with `isinstanceof`.\n   - Creating a new DateTime instance using `DateTime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)` or using the `+` operator.\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Union{AbstractDateTime, Missing}, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isnan(dt) || ismissing(dt)\n        error(\"Invalid DateTime provided.\")\n    elseif isa(dt, Date)\n        error(\"Invalid argument: 'dt' should be of DateTime type.\")\n    else\n        new_dt = dt + Hour(bump)\n        return new_dt\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `timezone_bumper` function checks whether the provided argument `dt` is missing, NaN (Not a Number), or a DateTime type using `isa` and `union`. If it's an invalid argument (missing or NaN), it throws an error. If it's a Date type, it also throws an error because the function is intended for DateTime types only. Finally, it creates a new DateTime instance by adding the given number of hours to the original datetime using the `Hour` type and returns it.\n\nThis approach follows the Julia programming style guidelines, ensuring that the code is efficient, clear, and well-documented while adhering to the given problem statement and special instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[375,387],"elapsed":17.487022375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
