Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) <: DateTime\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types, not $(typeof(dt))\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be a `DateTime` object, and `bump`, which is an optional argument with a default value of 3. If `bump` is not provided, the function will increase the timestamp by 3 hours.\n\nThe function first checks if `dt` is a `DateTime` object using the `<:` operator, which checks if the type of the first argument is a subtype of the second argument. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, the function returns the result of adding `bump` hours to `dt`.\n\nIf `dt` is not a `DateTime`, the function throws an `ArgumentError` with a message indicating that `timezone_bumper` only works with `DateTime` types.\n\nNote that this function will return a `DateTime` object, even if `dt` is already a `DateTime` object with the desired time zone information. If you need to preserve the time zone information, you may want to modify the function to take a `ZonedDateTime` object instead.","status":200,"tokens":[71,327],"elapsed":4.81604975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
