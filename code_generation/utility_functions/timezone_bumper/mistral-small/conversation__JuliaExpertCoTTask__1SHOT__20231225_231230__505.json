Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Check if the input type is DateTime, if not, throw an error.\n   - Increase the timestamp by the given number of hours.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump::Int = 3)\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper accepts only DateTime types, not $(typeof(dt))\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\n3.
