Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a function that should meet your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if !isinstance(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types\"))\n    end\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be a `DateTime` object, and `bump`, which is an optional integer argument that defaults to 3. If `dt` is not a `DateTime` object, the function throws an `ArgumentError`. Otherwise, it increases the timestamp by `bump` hours and returns the result.\n\nNote that we use the `Dates.Hour` function to represent the number of hours to bump by. This ensures that the function works correctly with time zones and daylight saving time.","status":200,"tokens":[71,209],"elapsed":2.8601625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
