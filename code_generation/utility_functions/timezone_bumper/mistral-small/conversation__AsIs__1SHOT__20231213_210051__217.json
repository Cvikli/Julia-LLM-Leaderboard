Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a function in Julia that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) <: DateTime\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ErrorException(\"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in two arguments: `dt`, which should be a `DateTime` object, and `bump`, which is an optional argument with a default value of 3. If `bump` is not provided, the function will increase the timestamp by 3 hours.\n\nThe function first checks if `dt` is a `DateTime` object using the `<:` operator, which checks if the type of the first argument is a subtype of the second argument. If `dt` is a `DateTime`, the function increases the timestamp by `bump` hours using the `Dates.Hour` function and returns the result.\n\nIf `dt` is not a `DateTime` object, the function throws an `ErrorException` with the message \"timezone_bumper only works with DateTime types\". This ensures that the function will not work with `Date` objects or any other type of object that is not a `DateTime`.","status":200,"tokens":[68,295],"elapsed":4.031784333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
