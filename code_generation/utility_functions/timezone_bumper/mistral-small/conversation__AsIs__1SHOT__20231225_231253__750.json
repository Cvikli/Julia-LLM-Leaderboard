If it is not, a `ValueError` is raised. The function also takes an optional `bump` argument with a default value of `3`.\n\nThe function returns a new `datetime` object that is `bump` hours after `dt`. The `timedelta` function from the `datetime` module is used to create a duration of `bump` hours, and it is added to `dt` using the `+` operator.","status":200,"tokens":[68,206],"elapsed":2.90946725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
