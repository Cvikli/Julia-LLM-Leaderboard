Here's a function in Julia that should do what you're asking for:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if typeof(dt) <: DateTime\n        return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ErrorException(\"timezone_bumper function only works with DateTime types, not Date types.\"))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes two arguments: `dt`, which should be a `DateTime` object, and `bump`, which is an optional integer argument that defaults to `3`. The function checks whether `dt` is a `DateTime` object using the `typeof` function and the diamond operator (`<:`). If `dt` is a `DateTime` object, the function increases it by `bump` hours using the `Dates.Hour` function and returns the result. If `dt` is not a `DateTime` object, the function throws an `ErrorException` with an appropriate error message.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[71,264],"elapsed":3.61668925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
