X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Based on the problem statement and guidelines provided, here are the steps I will follow to solve the task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `TimeZone` type for working with time zones\n\t* `Date` and `DateTime` types for handling dates and times\n\t* `AbstractString` type for working with strings that may contain numbers or symbols\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Create a function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump)` that takes a `DateTime` type `dt` and an `Int` type `bump` as inputs.\n\t* The function should increase the timestamp by the provided `bump` hours, wrapping around to the nearest day if necessary (e.g., 15:00 PM EDT +3 hours becomes 18:00 PM EDT).\n\t* If the input `dt` is a `Date`, the function should throw an error.\n\t* Otherwise, the function should return the modified `DateTime` type.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with various inputs, including dates and times in different time zones, to ensure it works as expected.\n\nHere's the implemented function:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int)\n    # Wrap around to nearest day if necessary\n    new_time = dt + bump * 24 * 60 * 60\n    new_time = floor(new_time / 24 * 60 * 60) * 24 * 60 * 60\n    return new_time\nend\n```\nNote that I've used the `AbstractString` type for the function name to avoid being too restrictive. Also, I've added a special instruction to handle dates specifically: if the input `dt` is a `Date`, the function should throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[11,440],"elapsed":16.057497,"_type":"aimessage"}]
