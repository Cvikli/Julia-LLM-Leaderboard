Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's the function you requested:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    # Sanity check\n    if isnothing(dt)\n        throw(\"Error: cannot operate on a missing DateTime\")\n    end\n\n    # Bump the timestamp by the provided amount\n    dt += bump * hours(dt)\n\n    # Return the modified DateTime\n    dt\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* We first check if `dt` is nothing (i.e., it doesn't exist). If so, we throw an error because we can't operate on a missing value.\n* Next, we compute the number of hours to bump `dt` by using `bump * hours(dt)`. The `hours` function is a built-in Julia function that returns the number of hours in a given time interval.\n* Finally, we return the modified `dt` value.\n\nNote: As per your request, this function only works for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","status":200,"tokens":[103,236],"elapsed":8.319859209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
