It uses the `+=` operator to add the desired amount of minutes (calculated by multiplying the hours by 60) to the timestamp, and then returns the modified `DateTime` object.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a `DateTime` object and an optional integer value:\n\n```julia\nnow = now(); # Get current timestamp\nbump = 2; # Increase the timestamp by 2 hours\nnew_time = timezone_bumper(now, bump); # Call the function with the provided values\n```","status":200,"tokens":[77,260],"elapsed":14.311554209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
