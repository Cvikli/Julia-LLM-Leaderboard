[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a potential solution that meets your specifications:\n\n```julia\nimport Base.+\n\nfunction +(dt::DateTime, bump::Int)\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(bump) != Int\n        error(\"Bump parameter must be an integer.\")\n    end\n    \n    return dt + bump\nend\n```\nThe function `+` was defined to add hours to a DateTime type. Then, the function `timezone_bumper` is defined to increase any provided timestamp by `bump` hours, with default value of 3. This function checks if `bump` parameter is an integer and throws an error if it isn't.\n\nHowever, this doesn't prevent you from using the function for Date types. If you want to strictly enforce that DateTime types only are used, you would need to add some additional type checking or validation logic.\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime || typeof(bump) != Int\n        error(\"Provided argument must be a DateTime and the bump parameter must be an integer.\")\n    end\n    \n    return dt + bump\nend\n```\nIn this version of the function, it checks that both `dt` is a DateTime type and `bump` is an Integer type. If either of these conditions are not met, it throws an error stating what each condition must be in order for the function to work correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[377,355],"elapsed":12.478994709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
