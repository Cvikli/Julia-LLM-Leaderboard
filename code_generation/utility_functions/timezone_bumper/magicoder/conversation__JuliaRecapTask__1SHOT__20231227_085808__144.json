[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can solve this problem by firstly checking if the input `dt` is of type DateTime. If not, throw an error. Then, add `bump::Int` hours to the time in `dt`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime; bump=3)\n    # Check if dt is of type DateTime\n    if !isa(dt, DateTime)\n        error(\"Provided timestamp must be of type DateTime.\")\n    end\n    \n    # Add bump hours to the time in dt\n    return dt + Dates.Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nIn this function:\n- `DateTime` is a built-in type in Julia's Dates module that represents date and time values.\n- The function takes a single argument `dt::DateTime`, which you must specify as the datetime value you want to adjust. \n- The keyword argument `bump=3` specifies the default bumping amount, which is set to +3 hours if no argument is provided.\n- If you call this function with an invalid timestamp (not of type DateTime), it will throw an error message \"Provided timestamp must be of type DateTime.\" \n- It returns a new `DateTime` value that represents the original time plus the amount specified by `bump`.","status":200,"tokens":[374,297],"elapsed":10.737749334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
