Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can define a function in Julia like this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Define the function for Date type\nfunction timezone_bumper(d::Date)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"Provided argument is of `Date` type. Please provide a DateTime type.\"))\nend\n```\nThe first function `timezone_bumper` takes as input two arguments, `dt`, which should be a DateTime object and `bump` (defaulting to 3), which can either be omitted or provided as an argument. It then returns the DateTime that results from adding `bump` hours to `dt`.\n\nThe second function `timezone_bumper` for Date type, throws an error if it receives a date instead of a datetime. The error message is \"Provided argument is of 'Date' type. Please provide a DateTime type.\" \n\nThus, this function will return the input DateTime plus the bump hours, or throw an error if a Date is provided as input.","status":200,"tokens":[113,247],"elapsed":7.715552625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
