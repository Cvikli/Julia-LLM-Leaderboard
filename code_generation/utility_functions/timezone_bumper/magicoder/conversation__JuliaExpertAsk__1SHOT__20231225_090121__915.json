Please provide DateTime.\"))\n    elseif typeof(dt) == DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    else\n        throw(ArgumentError(\"Unknown timestamp type.\"))\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function checks the type of input `dt` and if it is a `DateTime`, increases it by the number of hours specified in `bump`. If `dt` is a `Date`, it throws an error. The function will throw another error for types other than `DateTime` or `Date`. \n\nHere's how to use this function:\n```julia\ndt = DateTime(\"2021-01-01T12:00:00\")\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt) # This increases the timestamp by 3 hours.\n```\nYou can also specify a different `bump` value like this:\n```julia\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt; bump=5) # This increases the timestamp by 5 hours.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[113,289],"elapsed":8.940393167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
