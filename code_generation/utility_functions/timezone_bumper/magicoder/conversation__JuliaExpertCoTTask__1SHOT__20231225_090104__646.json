When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If it's not, an error message is printed.\n- If the input is a DateTime type, then it adds `bump` hours to that date and time using the `+` operator. The `Hour(bump)` function returns a duration equal to the number of hours specified by the `bump` argument.\n- Finally, we test the function with a provided data `DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)`. If everything is correct, it will return `2023-04-10T15:00:00` which represents the date and time increased by 3 hours.","status":200,"tokens":[211,314],"elapsed":16.240532,"_type":"aimessage"}]
