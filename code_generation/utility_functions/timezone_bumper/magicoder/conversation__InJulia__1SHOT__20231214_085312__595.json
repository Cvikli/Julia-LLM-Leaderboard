Here's an example of how you could implement the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n```\n# Import the DateTime type\nusing DateTime\n\n# Define the bump time (default is +3 hours)\nbump = 3\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=bump)\n    # Check if the input is a Date type\n    if dt.isdate\n        error(\"cannot bump a Date type\")\n    else\n        # Bump the timestamp by the specified amount of hours\n        dt += DateTimeDuration(bump)\n        return dt\n    end\nend\n```\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```\n# Create a DateTime object\ndt = DateTime(2023, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)\n\n# Bump the timestamp by 3 hours\nbumped_dt = timezone_bumper(dt, 3)\n\n# Print the bumped timestamp\nprintln(bumped_dt)\n```\nThis will output `2023-01-01 15:00:00`.\n\nNote that the function checks if the input is a `Date` type and throws an error if it is. This is because you can't bump a `Date` type, as it represents a point in time and not a duration of time.","status":200,"tokens":[74,312],"elapsed":10.4409355,"_type":"aimessage"}]
