Here is a function `timezone_bumper` that takes a `dt` timestamp and an optional `bump` parameter, which defaults to +3 hours:\n```\nimport datetime\n\ndef timezone_bumper(dt: datetime.datetime, bump: int = 3) -> datetime.datetime:\n    \"\"\"\n    Bumps the provided timestamp by the given number of hours in the specified time zone.\n\n    Args:\n        dt (datetime.datetime): The timestamp to be bumped.\n        bump (int, default=3): The number of hours to bump the timestamp by.\n\n    Returns:\n        datetime.datetime: The bumped timestamp in the specified time zone.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If `dt` is a `date` type instead of a `datetime` type.\n    \"\"\"\n    if dt.kind == datetime.date:\n        raise ValueError(\"Can only bump timestamps, not dates\")\n\n    bump_hours = bump * 3600 # Convert bump to hours\n    new_dt = dt + datetime.timedelta(hours=bump_hours)\n\n    return new_dt\n```\nHere's an explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. First, we import the `datetime` module, which provides classes and functions for working with dates and times.\n2. The `timezone_bumper` function takes two arguments: `dt` (which must be a `datetime.datetime` object) and `bump` (which defaults to +3 hours).\n3. We check if `dt` is a `date` type by checking its `kind` attribute. If it's a `date`, we raise a `ValueError`.\n4. Next, we convert the `bump` parameter to hours by multiplying it by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour).\n5. We add the `bump_hours` value to the original `dt` timestamp using the `timedelta` class. This creates a new timestamp that is the bumped version of the original one.\n6. Finally, we return the new timestamp as the result of the function.\n\nI hope this helps!
