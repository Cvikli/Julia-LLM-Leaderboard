If no timezone is specified, it will default to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) during calculations.\n\nStep 2: Check if the provided timestamp is of DateTime type. If it's not, throw an error message stating that only DateTime types are supported.\n\nStep 3: Inside the function, convert the input `dt` into a Universal Time Type (UTT) object by adding hours to the original time using the `+` operation.\n\nStep 4: Create a new DateTime object representing the result of converting the input `dt` to UTT and adding the specified bump value in hours. This is done by combining the original UTT with the additional time calculated in step 3.\n\nStep 5: If the specified timezone was not provided, convert the output DateTime back to the user's local timezone using Julia's built-in `localtime` function. Otherwise, keep the time in UTC (UTT).\n\nHere is the complete code implementing the steps above:\n```javascript\nusing Time\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\nif type(dt) != DateTime\nerror(\"Only DateTime types are supported.\")\nend\n\nutt <- dt + Hours(bump)\nresult_dt <- utt.incredir()\n\nif timezone_info(dt) != :none\nlocaltime <- localtime(result_dt)\nelse\nresult_dt\nend\n\nreturn result_dt\nend\n```\nNow you can use this function to increase a DateTime object by the specified number of hours:\n```javascript\nprint(timezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0)))\n```","status":200,"tokens":[204,426],"elapsed":10.924377792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
