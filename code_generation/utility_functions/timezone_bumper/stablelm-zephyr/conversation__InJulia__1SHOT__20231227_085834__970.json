First, let's ensure we have the `TimeZone` type from Julia's standard library to handle timezone-related operations.\n\nHere's the code:\n```julia\nusing TimeZone\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt : DateTime, bump : Int = 3)\nif isinstance(dt, Date)\nerror(\"Timezone bumper is not valid for Date type\")\nend\n\ndt += Hours(bump) * 24 * 60 * 60\nreturn dt\nend\n```\nNow you can use the `timezone_bumper` function. It takes a DateTime object (`dt`) and an optional `bump` integer (default is +3 hours). If the input `dt` is a Date, it will throw an error message saying that timezone bumper isn't valid for Date type. Otherwise, it will increase the provided timestamp by the number of hours specified in `bump`.","status":200,"tokens":[81,207],"elapsed":3.676443417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
