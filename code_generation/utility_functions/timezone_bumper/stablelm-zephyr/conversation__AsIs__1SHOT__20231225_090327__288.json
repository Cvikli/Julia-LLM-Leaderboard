This function takes a `DateTime` object and an integer `bump`, which defaults to 3. It throws an error for Date objects because a Date has no time component and can't be incremented by an amount specified using `Int`.\n\n```rust\nuse chrono::{Datetime, Utc};\n\nfn timezone_bumper(dt: datetime::Datetime<Utc>, bump: u32) -> Result<datetime::Datetime<Utc>, String> {\nif dt.ymd() != (1, 1, 1) { // Ensure we're working with a DateTime and not a Date\nreturn Err(\"Error: Provided an invalid date. Please provide a DateTime type.\").into();\n}\n\nlet incremented_dt = dt.shift_by(std::time::Duration(*bump * 24 * 60 * 60))?; // Shift the datetime by bump hours\n\nOk(incremented_dt)\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes a `DateTime` object (from the `chrono` crate) and an integer as input. It first checks if the provided value is a Date, in which case it throws an error. If not, it shifts the DateTime object by the specified number of hours (multiplied by 24, 60, and 60 to convert it into days), wrapping around midnight if necessary.\n\nPlease make sure you have the `chrono` crate installed in your project:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nchrono = \"0.4\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[78,333],"elapsed":5.784947459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
