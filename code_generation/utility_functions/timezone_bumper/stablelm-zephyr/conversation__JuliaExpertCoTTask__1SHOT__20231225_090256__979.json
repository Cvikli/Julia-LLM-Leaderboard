Default value for `bump` is +3.\n\nStep 2: Check if the input `dt` is of DateTime type by using the `isinstance()` function from Julia's Base module. If it's not a DateTime, throw an error. For Date types, we can use the `:::` operator to check if they are subtypes of DateTime. If it's still not a DateTime, raise an error.\n\nStep 3: Check that `bump` is an integer type by using the `isinteger()` function from Julia's Base module. If it's not an integer, throw an error.\n\nStep 4: Add the value of `bump` to the input `dt`. To ensure timezone consistency when bumping hours, we'll use the `utc_hour()` function from the Date/Time module in Julia (julialang.org/docs/stdlib-00336-basics.html#DateTime).\n\nHere's the code implementing these steps:\n```julia\nusing DateTime\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = +3)\nif !isinstance(dt, DateTime)\nthrow(TypeError(\"Input must be a DateTime type\"))\nelseif dt::DateTime:::Base == Date\nthrow(TypeError(\"Input is not a valid DateTime subtype (Date)\"))\nend\n\nif !(typeof(bump) <: Int)\nthrow(TypeError(\"bump must be an integer\"))\nend\n\ndt += (utc_hour(dt) * 24) + bump * 24\nreturn dt\nend\n```\nNow, you can use the function to increase a DateTime object by 3 hours using the provided example:\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[204,454],"elapsed":8.609645125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
