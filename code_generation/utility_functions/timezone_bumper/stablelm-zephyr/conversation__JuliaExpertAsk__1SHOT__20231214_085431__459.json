Here is the function you requested:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Union{Int,Nothing})\n    if bump !== nothing\n        bump = 3 # Default bump of +3 hours\n    end\n    new_dt = dt + DateDiff(Hour, dt, bump)\n    return new_dt\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `dt` (a `DateTime` type), and `bump` (an `Int` or `Nothing` defaulting to +3 hours).\n* We use the `DateDiff` function to calculate the difference between the original timestamp and the new timestamp, in hours.\n* We then return the new timestamp.\n\nNote: As you requested, the function will only work for `DateTime` types and will throw an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[103,199],"elapsed":7.067111625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
