[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It should only work for DateTime types and throw an error for Date types.\n2. **Inputs**\nThe function `timezone_bumper` has two input arguments:\n\t* The first argument, `dt`, is a timestamp in the format of either a DateTime or Date type.\n\t* The second argument, `bump`, is an integer representing the number of hours to add to the timestamp (defaults to +3).\n3. **Output**\nThe function will return a new timestamp that is `bump` hours added to the original value.\n4. **Process**\nTo achieve this objective:\n\t* Check if the input type for `dt` is DateTime or Date. If it's not, throw an error.\n\t* If the type of `dt` is DateTime, add `bump` hours to the timestamp.\n5. **Result**\nThe function will return a new timestamp that is `bump` hours added to the original value.\n6. **Exceptions**\nIf there are any exceptions or errors during the process:\n\t* If the input type for `dt` is not DateTime, throw an error saying \"Only DateTime types allowed.\"\n7. **Examples**\nSome examples of how this function would work:\n\t* `timezone_bumper(DateTime(\"2021-06-30T19:45:00\"), 2)` will return `2021-07-01T21:45:00`.\n\t* `timezone_bumper(Date(\"2021-06-30\"))` will throw an error saying \"Only DateTime types allowed.\"\n8. **Notes**\nIf no specific instructions are provided, the function should follow good programming practices, such as handling exceptions and errors properly, using clear variable names, and making efficient use of resources.","status":200,"tokens":[0,454],"elapsed":18.805625083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
