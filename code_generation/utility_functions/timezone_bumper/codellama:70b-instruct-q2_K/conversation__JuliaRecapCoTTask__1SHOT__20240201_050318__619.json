[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        throw(\"Timezone Bumper only works with DateTime types.\")\n    end\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments: `dt`, the timestamp, and `bump`, the number of hours to increase by. If no value is provided for `bump`, it defaults to 3 hours. The function checks the type of `dt`. If it's not a `DateTime`, it throws an error. Otherwise, it increases `dt` by `bump` hours and returns the new timestamp.\n\nNote that I used Julia's built-in `Hour` function for adding hours to dates. This is more robust than simply adding integers to DateTime objects because it takes into account leap years, time zones, and daylight saving time adjustments.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or requests! ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":9.659533595,"_type":"aimessage"}]
