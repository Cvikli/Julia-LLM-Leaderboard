[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Write a function `timezone_bumper(dt, bump=3)` that takes a single argument `dt` and returns a new datetime with the hour increased by `bump`.\n2. In order to throw an error for Date types, you can use `isinstance()` function to check whether `dt` is a DateTime type or not. If it's not, raise an Exception.\n3. You can then update the hour of the datetime object using the `replace` method and return the new value.\n\nHere's how you would implement the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    if !isinstance(dt, DateTime)\n        throw(\"Invalid input type\")\n    end\n    new_time = replace(dt; hour = dt.hour + bump)\n    return new_time\nend\n```\n\nNote that this function will work only for instances of `DateTime` and throws an error otherwise. If you need to support multiple types, you can use Julia's built-in multiple dispatch mechanism to achieve this.","status":200,"tokens":[19,243],"elapsed":10.209893903,"_type":"aimessage"}]
