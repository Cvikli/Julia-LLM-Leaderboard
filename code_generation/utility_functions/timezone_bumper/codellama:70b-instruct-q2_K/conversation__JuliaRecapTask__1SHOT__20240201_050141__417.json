[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a sample code snippet that implements the requested function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\n\nThe `timezone_bumper` function takes two arguments - `dt`, a DateTime object, and `bump`, an integer representing the number of hours to add. The default value for `bump` is 3, but it can be changed if specified by the user.\n\nThe function adds the specified number of hours to the provided DateTime using the built-in `Hour()` function from Julia's Dates module. If a Date object is passed instead, it will throw an error due to Julia's multiple dispatch system.\n\nPlease note that this code snippet assumes you have already imported the Dates module into your environment for working with dates and times in Julia. If not, you can add `using Dates` at the top of your code or import the module using `import Dates` before using any functions from it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,233],"elapsed":9.636461482,"_type":"aimessage"}]
