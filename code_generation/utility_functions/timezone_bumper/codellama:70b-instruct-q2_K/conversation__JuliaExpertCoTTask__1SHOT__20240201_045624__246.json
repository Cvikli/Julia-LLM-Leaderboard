To solve this problem, you would create a function that takes two arguments - `dt` as a `DateTime` type and `bump` as an integer (defaulting to +3 hours). The `bump` argument will be used to adjust the time by the given number of hours:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates \nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3) \n    if typeof(dt) == DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump)\n    elseif typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Date objects are not supported. Please provide a DateTime object.\")\n    end\nend\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 3) # returns 2023-04-10T15:00:00\n```\n\nThe function first checks whether the input is a `DateTime` object. If it's not, an error is thrown. The default value for `bump` is 3 hours if no argument is provided. Otherwise, it returns a new DateTime object with the bumped time.\n\nNote: This function will only work as expected if the input date and time are valid. In case of invalid times (such as a non-existent leap second), this function may not produce accurate results.","status":200,"tokens":[0,326],"elapsed":13.522754912,"_type":"aimessage"}]
