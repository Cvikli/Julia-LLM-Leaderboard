Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Julia's standard library has a built-in function `TimeZone(hours, minutes)` that returns a time zone with the specified number of hours and minutes. You can use this function to create a time zone offset and add it to your DateTime object.\n\nHere is how you would write the `timezone_bumper` function:\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    try\n        if dt isa Date; throw(ArgumentError(\"Date objects not supported\")) end\n        bumped = DateTime(dt + TimeZone(bump))\n        return bumped\n    catch e\n        println(\"An error occurred: $e\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, the first argument `dt` is a DateTime object. The second argument `bump` is an optional integer value (defaults to 3) representing the number of hours to add to the provided timestamp. If you don't pass a `bump` value when calling the function, it will default to +3 hours.\n\nThe function checks if the input is a DateTime object using `dt isa Date`. This condition returns true only if `dt` is an instance of type `Date`, which throws an error. If `dt` is not a `Date` object (i.e., it's a `DateTime`), the code continues to execute.\n\nThe function uses the TimeZone built-in function to create a time zone with the specified number of hours, minutes, and seconds. In this case, you only need to specify hours, so you can use the following syntax:\n```julia\nTimeZone(hours)\n```\nThis creates a time zone offset with `hours` as the number of hours. You then add this time zone to the DateTime object using the `+` operator. This shifts the timestamp by the specified amount, resulting in a new DateTime object (`bumped`).\nThe function returns the bumped DateTime object, which is the output. If an error occurs during execution (for instance, if you pass a Date object), the code catches it using a `try...catch` block and prints the error message.","status":200,"tokens":[0,478],"elapsed":19.613967045,"_type":"aimessage"}]
