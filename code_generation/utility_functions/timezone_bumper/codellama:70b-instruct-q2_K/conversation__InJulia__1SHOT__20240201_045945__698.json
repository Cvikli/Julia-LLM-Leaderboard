Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1.  Julia doesn't have a built-in function for adding time zones, so we need to calculate the hourly offset manually.\n2.  Since there are no exceptions for Daylight Saving Time (DST) or other time zone anomalies in Julia, it is recommended to use the `FixedTimeZone` type from the `TimeZones.jl` package instead of manually adding hours to timestamps.\n3.  Here's how you could write a function that adds three hours by default and throws an error for Date types:\n\n```julia-repl\nusing TimeZones\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt, bump = 3)::Union{DateTime, Nothing}\n    if typeof(dt) == DateTime\n        # Use a fixed time zone with the desired offset in hours.\n        tz = FixedTimeZone(1hour * bump)\n        return dt + tz\n    elseif typeof(dt) == Date\n        error(\"Cannot add time zones to date type.\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   The `timezone_bumper` function takes a `DateTime` or `Date` as its first argument (`dt`).\n*   It also accepts an optional second parameter, `bump`, which defaults to 3. This parameter determines the number of hours to add.\n*   The function returns a new DateTime with the desired offset if the input is a DateTime type.\n*   If the input is a Date type, it throws an error stating that time zones cannot be added to dates.\n*   The `Union` type annotation in the function definition ensures that the return value is either a DateTime or Nothing (the default return value for errors).\n\nNote: This code assumes that you have installed the `TimeZones.jl` package and have imported it with the `using` statement.","status":200,"tokens":[0,411],"elapsed":16.797054271,"_type":"aimessage"}]
