This way, the function can only be applied to `DateTime` objects, throwing an error when a `Date` object is passed. \nThe optional argument `bump` is set to 3 hours by default. If you want to increase the timestamp by any other number of hours, just pass it as an additional argument. \n\n**Note:** The function throws an error for Date types because there's no concept of \"hours\" in Julia's `Date` type. This is to ensure that users can only pass a valid DateTime object (with time component) to the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,237],"elapsed":9.654711258,"_type":"aimessage"}]
