You can override this by passing a different number when calling the function. For example:\n\n```julia\n# bump = 1 hour\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0), 1)\n\n# bump = default (3 hours)\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0))\n```\n\nNote that this function can't be used with a `Date` object because of the type checks. If you try to call it with a `Date`, an error will occur:\n\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2023,4,10))\n\n# Error: Can't use a Date as input\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,354],"elapsed":14.532180365,"_type":"aimessage"}]
