Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the function:\n```\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isdate(dt)\n        error(\"Input should be a DateTime type.\")\n    else\n        return dt + hours(bump)\n    end\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `dt` which is the input timestamp and `bump` which is the number of hours to add to the timestamp (defaults to 3).\n* It first checks if the input is a DateTime type using the `isdate()` function. If it's not, it throws an error with an appropriate message.\n* If the input is a DateTime type, it uses the `+hours()` method to add the specified number of hours to the timestamp and returns the resulting DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[111,185],"elapsed":7.687495875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
