[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and very systematic in your approach to solving problems. \nYou follow the below approach when writing code.

When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"## Step 1: Define the function and its arguments\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n```\nThe function takes two arguments: `dt` of type `DateTime` and `bump` of type `Int`. The default value for `bump` is set to `3` hours.\n\n## Step 2: Write the code to implement the function\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    new_dt = dt + Hours(bump)\n    if isdate(new_dt)\n        error(\"Bump must be a multiple of 24 hours\")\n    else\n        return new_dt\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function first calculates the new timestamp by adding `Hours(bump)` to the input timestamp. Then it checks if the result is a Date type or not. If it's a Date type, it raises an error stating that \"Bump must be a multiple of 24 hours\". Otherwise, it returns the new timestamp.\n\n## Step 3: Test the function with the provided input data\n```julia\ntimezone_bumper(DateTime(2023, 4, 10, 12, 0),3)\n```\nThe output of this code should be `2023-04-11 05:00:00`.\n\n## Step 4: Check that the solution is correct\n```julia\n# Test with Date type input\ntimezone_bumper(Date(2023, 4, 10),3)\n```\nThe output of this code should raise an error stating \"Bump must be a multiple of 24 hours\".","status":200,"tokens":[209,408],"elapsed":22.560683708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
