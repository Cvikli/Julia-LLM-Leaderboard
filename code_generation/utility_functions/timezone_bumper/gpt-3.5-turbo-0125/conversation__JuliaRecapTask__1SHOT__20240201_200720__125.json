[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

We import the `Dates` module to work with date and time-related functions.\n\n2. We define a function `timezone_bumper` that has two methods:\n   - The first method takes a `DateTime` object `dt` and an integer `bump` as input, with a default value of 3 hours. It increases the provided timestamp by `bump` hours and returns the updated `DateTime`.\n   - The second method takes a `Date` object `dt` and an integer `bump` as input. This method throws an `ArgumentError` with a message stating that only `DateTime` types are allowed.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works only for `DateTime` types and throws an error for `Date` types.","status":200,"tokens":[324,221],"elapsed":1.902008042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
