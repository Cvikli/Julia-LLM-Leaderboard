[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours). Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code that fulfills your task requirements:\n```julia\nusing Dates\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3) # Use default value of 3 hours\n    # Check if dt is a DateTime type or throw an error\n    typeof(dt) != DateTime && throw(ErrorException(\"Input should be of type DateTime.\"))\n    return dt + Hour(bump) # Add the number of bump hours to the input DateTime\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two arguments:\n1. `dt::DateTime`: A DateTime object representing a specific timestamp. The type is explicitly specified as `DateTime`.\n2. `bump=3`: An integer representing the number of hours to add to the input timestamp. This has a default value of 3, but it can be changed if desired.\n\nInside the function:\n1. We check that the input argument `dt` is indeed a DateTime type by using `typeof(dt) != DateTime`. If this condition returns true (meaning `dt` isn't a DateTime), an error is thrown with the message \"Input should be of type DateTime.\".\n2. If the type-check passes, we return `dt + Hour(bump)`, which adds the specified number of hours to the input timestamp using Julia's built-in date/time functionality. This effectively \"bumps\" the given timestamp by the desired amount.","status":200,"tokens":[0,321],"elapsed":17.538129771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
