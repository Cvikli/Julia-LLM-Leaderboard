The function first checks whether `dt` is a DateTime object. If it's not, it throws an error using the `DomainError` exception.\n\nIf `dt` is indeed a DateTime object, it adds `bump` hours to it using the `Hour()` function and returns the result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":9.893521845,"_type":"aimessage"}]
