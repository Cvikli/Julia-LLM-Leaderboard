Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following code defines a function named 'timezone_bumper' that takes two arguments, dt and bump. It checks if the given timestamp is of type DateTime and then adds the specified number of hours (defaults to +3) to it. If the input is not a DateTime type, an error message will be displayed.\n\n```julia-repl\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    # Check if dt is of type DateTime\n    if typeof(dt) == DateTime\n        return dt + Hour(bump) \n    else\n        error(\"The input must be a DateTime type\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn the above function, 'timezone_bumper' takes two arguments, dt and bump. 'dt' is the timestamp you want to modify while 'bump' is the number of hours you want to add (defaults to 3). The code checks if 'dt' is of type DateTime using the 'typeof' function and if it is, it adds the specified number of hours to the timestamp. If the input is not a DateTime type, an error message will be displayed.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can use this function:\n\n```julia-repl\ndt = now()  # Create a new DateTime object for today's date and time\ntimezone_bumper(dt)  # Increases the timestamp by 3 hours\ntimezone_bumper(dt, 5)  # Increases the timestamp by 5 hours\n\n# Using Date instead of DateTime will result in an error message:\nd = today()  # Create a new Date object for today's date\ntimezone_bumper(d)  # Error: The input must be a DateTime type\n```\n\nThe 'timezone_bumper' function can be used to manipulate timestamps and add hours to them while ensuring that the input is of type DateTime.","status":200,"tokens":[0,431],"elapsed":23.17876409,"_type":"aimessage"}]
