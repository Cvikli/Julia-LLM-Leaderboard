It also ensures that only DateTime objects are used and raises an exception if a Date object is passed as an argument.\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump=3)\n    # Check if dt is of type DateTime\n    if typeof(dt) != DateTime\n        error(\"Invalid input: expected DateTime, got $(typeof(dt))\")\n    end\n    \n    # Add 'bump' hours to the given datetime object\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n```\nThe `timezone_bumper` function checks the type of the input before performing any operation. If it is a DateTime, then the function adds `bump` (which defaults to 3) number of hours to the timestamp provided by the user. However, if the input type is not DateTime an exception will be raised.\n\nNote that this function uses the [Dates](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Dates/) module from Julia's standard library. The `Hour` function ensures that it adds hours to a DateTime object, and not just an integer.","status":200,"tokens":[0,270],"elapsed":14.458323848,"_type":"aimessage"}]
