First of all, we need to import the Dates module, since we'll be working with dates and times in Julia.\n2. Now, we can create our `timezone_bumper` function that takes a DateTime object as input (which will represent the original timestamp) and an optional integer argument representing the number of hours to bump by (if none is provided, it defaults to 3).\n3. Inside the function, we check whether the given date is actually a `DateTime` object using `isa`, throwing an error if it's not. If it is indeed a DateTime object, we use the `+` operator to add the number of hours represented by `bump`. We then return the modified timestamp as a `DateTime` object.\n4. Finally, we call our `timezone_bumper` function with an example date and a specified bump value. Note that if you provide a `Date` instead of a `DateTime`, the error will be thrown accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,211],"elapsed":11.298449746,"_type":"aimessage"}]
