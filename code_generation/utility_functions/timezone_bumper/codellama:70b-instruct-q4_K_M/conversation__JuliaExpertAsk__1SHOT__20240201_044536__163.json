If it is, we add `Hour(bump)` to the timestamp. This will increase the DateTime object by `bump` number of hours.\n* However, if `dt` is a Date object, we throw an error (`\"Timezone Bumper doesn't support Date types.\"`). You can customize this error message as needed.\n* If `dt` is neither a DateTime nor Date, we throw another error (`\"Timezone Bumper only supports DateTime and Date types.\"`) to indicate that the function only accepts these two types of objects.","status":200,"tokens":[0,295],"elapsed":15.824872538,"_type":"aimessage"}]
