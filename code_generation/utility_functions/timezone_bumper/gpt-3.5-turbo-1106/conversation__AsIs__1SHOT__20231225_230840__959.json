Here's the code for the function `timezone_bumper` that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\n# Test the function\ntimestamp = now()\nprintln(\"Original timestamp: $timestamp\")\n\nnew_timestamp = timezone_bumper(timestamp)\nprintln(\"Timestamp bumped by default 3 hours: $new_timestamp\")\n\nnew_timestamp = timezone_bumper(timestamp, 5)\nprintln(\"Timestamp bumped by 5 hours: $new_timestamp\")\n```\n\nIn this function, we define `timezone_bumper` to take a `DateTime` object `dt` and an integer `bump` (defaults to 3) as input and return the updated timestamp by adding the specified hours to it. If the input is not a `DateTime` type, it will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[64,181],"elapsed":2.1319725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
