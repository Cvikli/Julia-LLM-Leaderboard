Here's a possible implementation for the `timezone_bumper` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3)\n    return dt + Hour(bump)\nend\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::Date, bump::Int=3)\n    throw(ArgumentError(\"This function only works for DateTime types\"))\nend\n```\n\nThis implementation includes two versions of the `timezone_bumper` function: one for DateTime types and one for Date types. The first version correctly increases the timestamp by the specified number of hours, while the second version throws an error if a Date type is provided. This ensures that the function only works for DateTime types, as requested.","status":200,"tokens":[67,147],"elapsed":2.421797334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
