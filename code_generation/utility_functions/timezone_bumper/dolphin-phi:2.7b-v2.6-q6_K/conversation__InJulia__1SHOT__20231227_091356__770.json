Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution for the problem in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, Timezones\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTimeType, bump::Int) where DateTimeType == DateTime, Int\nif !isdate(dt)\nraise TypeError(\"Input must be a date\")\nend\n\nreturn dt + Time::Local.fromTime(bump::Int * 24 / 1000) // 1 % 1\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The function `timezone_bumper` takes two parameters, `dt` and `bump`.\n- The type of `dt` is checked using the type checking system in Julia. If it's not a `DateTimeType`, an error is raised with an appropriate message.\n- A `Time::Local.fromTime(bump::Int * 24 / 1000) // 1 % 1` expression is used to convert the time bump in hours to a `Time` object. The division by 1000 converts from seconds to hours (since there are 1000 seconds in an hour), and the modulus operation ensures that the result is within the range of valid Time objects.\n- This `Time` object is then added to `dt` using `+`, which correctly handles timezone adjustments, and returned as the result. \n- The function also checks for any potential error with the `raise` statement.\n\nLet's test this function:\n```julia\nt = timezone_bumper(DateTime('2020-12-31T23:59:59'), +3)\nprint(t)\n```\nThis should output:\n```\n2000-01-02T00:00:00+03:00\n```","status":200,"tokens":[77,375],"elapsed":9.764889375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
