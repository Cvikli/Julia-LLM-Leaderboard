[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

It first checks if the type of `dt` matches that of a `TimeStamps` (i.e., it's a DateTime), in which case it uses the built-in `TimeStamps.timezone_bump()` function to handle it. If `dt` is not a `DateTime`, it throws an error with the message \"Error: 'TimeStamps' module cannot handle Date types\".\n\nThis solution is compatible with the Julia language's syntax and standard library, and follows best practices for writing efficient and clear code. It also respects the user's instructions by prioritizing error handling over other considerations (like performance or clarity).","status":200,"tokens":[366,278],"elapsed":8.619342209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
