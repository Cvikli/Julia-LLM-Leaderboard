If it's not, then we return an error message stating that the input must be a datetime type. Otherwise, if the input is a date type, we also throw an error message because our function is designed to work only with `DateTime` types.\n\nIf the input is a `datetime`, we add the bump value in hours (defaults to +3 hours) using the `TimeZone` function from the `DataStructures.TimeZone` module. The `+` operator is used to add timezone offset and it takes two arguments: the time zone code (`UTC-` for UTC -3 hours) and \"Hours\" as the unit of measurement.","status":200,"tokens":[203,299],"elapsed":11.902237125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
