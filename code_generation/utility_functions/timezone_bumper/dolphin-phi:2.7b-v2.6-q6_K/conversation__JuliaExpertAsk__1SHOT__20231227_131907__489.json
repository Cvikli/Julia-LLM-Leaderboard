Make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function in Julia that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing DataTime, DateTime\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\nif isofunction(bump) && isinstance(bump(1), Int)\nbump = bump(2)# Convert to Int type if necessary\nend\n\nnew_time = dt + (bump * DataTime.hour)\n\nreturn new_time % DataTime.Day == 0 ? new_time : timezone_bumper(new_time, bump - 1)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if `bump` is a function of type Int and not a DateTime type. If it is a DateTime, it converts the bump to an integer by accessing its second element (as functions are passed by their arguments). Then it calculates the new timestamp by adding `bump * DataTime.hour` hours to the provided timestamp.\n\nThe function uses `%` operator to check if the new time is on a day boundary, i.e., it's divisible by one day. If not, it calls itself recursively with the updated `bump`. The base case for this recursion is when `bump` is 0 (i.e., no more increments), in which case we simply return the original timestamp `dt`.\n\nThis function should work only for DateTime types and throw an error for any other type, such as a Date or another datatype that does not implement `DataTime`, as it checks the input type at the start.","status":200,"tokens":[114,349],"elapsed":9.207547334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
