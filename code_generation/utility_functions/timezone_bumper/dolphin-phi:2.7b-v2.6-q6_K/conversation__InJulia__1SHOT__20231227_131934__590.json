It also throws an error if `dt` is not of type `DateTime`.\n\n```julia\nusing TimeZone\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int=3) where TimeZone\nif !isstruct(dt, \"datetime\") || !isstruct(bump, Int)\nthrow error(\"Both arguments must be of type 'datetime' and 'Int'\")\nend\n\nbump_hours = ifelse(bump > 0, bump, -bump)\n\nreturn dt + hours(bump_hours)\nend\n```\nYou can test this function with a `DateTime` like: \n\n```julia\npush!(Time::TimeZones, timezone_bumper(datetime(), 7)) # Adds 7 hours to the current timestamp.\npush!(Time::TimeZones, timezone_bumper(datetime())) # Increases the current timestamp by 3 hours (default).\n```\nThis function uses the `hours` method of a `DateTime` type in TimeZone module to get the equivalent number of hours from `bump`. If `bump` is greater than 0, it means that we need to add hours; if `bump` is less than 0, it means that we need to subtract hours. We use `ifelse` to handle both scenarios.","status":200,"tokens":[77,337],"elapsed":8.74396675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
