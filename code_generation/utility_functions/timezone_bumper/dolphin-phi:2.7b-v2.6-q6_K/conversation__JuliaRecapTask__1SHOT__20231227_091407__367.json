[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

We need to make sure it works only for DateTime types and throws an error for Date types.\n\nHere is the solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing TimeTz, NumericTypes\n\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::TimeTz, bump::Int = 3)\nif typeof(dt, 'Date')\nerror(\"Function only accepts DateTimes\")\nend\nreturn dt + interval('hours', bump)\nend\n```\nIn this solution:\n1. We are importing the necessary modules `TimeTz` for handling timezone data and `NumericTypes` for type checking.\n2. We define a function `timezone_bumper` that takes two parameters: `dt` which is an instance of `TimeTz` and `bump`, which defaults to 3 but can be provided as an integer argument.\n3. Inside the function, we first check if the type of `dt` is 'Date'. If it is, we throw an error saying that this function only accepts DateTimes.\n4. If the type of `dt` is not 'Date', we increase `bump` by converting it to a `hours` interval using the `interval` function from the `TimeTz` library and then add it to `dt`. This ensures that the timestamp increases by the provided number of hours.\n5. Finally, we return the modified timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[363,337],"elapsed":10.239716667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
