The default value for `bump` is 3.\n- Then, we check if the input data type is a `DateTime`. If it's not, we throw an error because the function is only defined to work with `DateTime` types.\n- If the input data type is indeed a `DateTime`, we handle negative `bump` values by setting them as positive using ternary operator (`ifelse(...)`).\n- Finally, we add the timezone bump to the provided timestamp and return the result. \n\nWe use `datetime::tz.Local()` to get the local timezone of Julia. The multiplication with the bump value gives us the number of hours to be added to the timestamp in the local time zone.","status":200,"tokens":[203,332],"elapsed":9.210926125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
