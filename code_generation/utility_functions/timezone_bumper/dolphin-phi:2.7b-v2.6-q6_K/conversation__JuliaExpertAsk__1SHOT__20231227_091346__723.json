It checks if the first argument is a valid `DateTime` object. If so, it converts that `DateTime` into UTC time, adds the number of hours (defaults to +3) from `bump`, and then converts back to local timezone before returning it.\n\nIf the `dt` does not represent a `DateTime`, an error is thrown with a descriptive message, and the function returns nothing. This way we ensure that the function works only for `DateTime` types.","status":200,"tokens":[114,271],"elapsed":7.177028125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
