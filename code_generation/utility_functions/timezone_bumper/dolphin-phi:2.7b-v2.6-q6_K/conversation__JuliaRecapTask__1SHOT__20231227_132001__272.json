[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

The input parameter `dt` is of type `DateTime`, and `bump` is of type `Int`. \n\nWe first convert `bump` to its modulus with 24 hours (to ensure that it's within valid timezone). Then we check if the provided timestamp `dt` is a date. If so, we throw an error.\n\nIf the input is a `Time::DateTime`, which includes `Time::DateTime.Naive`, we proceed to set the local timezone as 'America/New_York' and add the desired number of hours (`bump`) in days to the timestamp `dt`. The result is then returned, with the adjusted timestamp being within the valid timezone.\n\nThe function will throw an error for any other types of input, including non-timezone compatible date types like `LocalTimeZone.Naive`, which does not support 'America/New_York'.","status":200,"tokens":[363,349],"elapsed":10.552782292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
