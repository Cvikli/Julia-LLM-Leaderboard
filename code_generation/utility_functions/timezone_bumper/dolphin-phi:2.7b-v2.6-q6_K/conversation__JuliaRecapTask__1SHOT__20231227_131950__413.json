[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

If it's not, we throw an error. \n\nIf the type check passes, then we calculate the `new_timestamp` by adding `TimeOffset(bump)` to `dt`, where `TimeOffset` is a Timezone object that can be obtained from `TimeZone`. This effectively increases the timestamp by `bump` hours (taking into account daylight saving time adjustments if any). \n\nThe resulting timestamp will be of type `Time`, which Julia's built-in DateTime types cannot handle. Therefore, we convert this to a regular `Time` using the `hd` function before returning it. If you want to keep the datetime type, you can modify the return statement like so: \n\n```julia\nreturn new_timestamp as Time\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[363,283],"elapsed":8.732543042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
