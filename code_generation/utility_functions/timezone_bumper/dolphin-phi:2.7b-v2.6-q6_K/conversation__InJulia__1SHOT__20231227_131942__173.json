We first check if the input parameter is of type `Date`. If it is, we throw an error with a message saying that only `DateTime` types can be used with this function.\n2. Then, we calculate the number of hours to add in `bump %= 24`. The modulus operator (%) will make sure that even if `bump` is greater than 24, it will always return the value within the range of 0 to 23 (since there are only 24 hours in a day).\n3. Finally, we create a new `LocalTime` from the provided timestamp and an offset of `hour: dt.hour + bump`. This effectively adds the given number of hours to the timestamp.\n4. The function then returns this new timestamp.","status":200,"tokens":[77,285],"elapsed":7.393121958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
