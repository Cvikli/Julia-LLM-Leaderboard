Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if isa(dt, DateTime)\n        new_dt = dt + Hours(bump)\n        return new_dt\n    else\n        error(\"Input must be a DateTime type.\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3.

Check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe function correctly increases the DateTime by the specified number of hours and returns the new DateTime.
