[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `timezone_bumper(dt,bump)` that increases any provided timestamp by `bump::Int` hours (defaults to +3 hours).

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Defining a function\n   - Checking the type of a DateTime or Date object\n   - Throwing an error\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction timezone_bumper(dt::DateTime, bump::Int = 3)\n    if eltype(dt) <: DateTime\n        return dt + Hours(bump)\n    else\n        error(\"Invalid argument type. timezone_bumper only supports DateTime types.\")\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe function `timezone_bumper` takes a single argument `dt` of type `DateTime` and an optional argument `bump` of type `Int` with a default value of 3 hours. The function checks if the type of the input `dt` is a `DateTime` using the `eltype` function and the `<:` operator for type comparison. If the condition is true, the function returns the input `dt` with the given `bump` hours added using the `Hours` constructor from the `Dates` module. If the condition is false, the function throws an error using the `error` function.\n\nThis solution adheres to the problem statement and the special instruction provided. It uses the Julia standard library and does not introduce any new packages. The function is type-annotated and emphasizes performance and clarity.","status":200,"tokens":[378,345],"elapsed":2.959516583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
