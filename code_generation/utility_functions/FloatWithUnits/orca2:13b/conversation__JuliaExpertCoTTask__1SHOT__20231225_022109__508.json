Think through the approach: To solve this task, I need to create a new struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` and `unit`. Then, I will write a `show` method that concatenates the value and unit with a space.\n2. Write any functions and other code needed: Since there are no additional functions or code needed, I can move on to solving the task.\n3. Solve the task: I will define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and write its `show` method.\n4. Check that my solution is correct: I will test the `show` method with an example value and unit.\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> show(stdout, fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[200,349],"elapsed":30.238132583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
