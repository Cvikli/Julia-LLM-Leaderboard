Here's the answer you're looking for:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return \"$($f.value) $($f.unit)\"\nend\n```\n\nNow, let me explain why this code works:\n\nThe `show` method in Julia is a special method that is called automatically when you use the `show` keyword to display an object. In this case, we're defining a custom `show` method for our `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n\nWe start by using the `$` symbol to insert the value of the `value` field into the string. Then, we use the dot notation to access the `unit` field and concatenate it with a space (\" \") followed by the value of the `value` field. Finally, we wrap the whole thing in double quotes so that Julia knows it's a string.\n\nThere you have it! Now you can use the `show` method to display your `FloatWithUnits` objects in a nice, concise format.","status":200,"tokens":[105,252],"elapsed":8.828617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
