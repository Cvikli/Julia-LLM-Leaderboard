If you want a different level of precision, just change the second argument to `self.value.truncate()`. This implementation also uses the static unit string, which might not be what you want if the unit depends on the instance of the struct.","status":200,"tokens":[75,200],"elapsed":6.3378635,"_type":"aimessage"}]
