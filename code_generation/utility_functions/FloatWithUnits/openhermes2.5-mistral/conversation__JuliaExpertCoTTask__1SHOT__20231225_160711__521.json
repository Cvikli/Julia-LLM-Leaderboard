We can define the struct as follows:\n\n```julia\nimmutable FloatWithUnits{T <: Union(AbstractFloat, Int)}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nHere, we've defined an immutable struct `FloatWithUnits`, which takes two arguments: `value` (of type `AbstractFloat` or `Int`) and `unit` of type `String`. We've also added a constraint that the value can be either an `AbstractFloat` (like `Float64`, `Float32`, etc.) or an `Int`.\n\nNow, let's implement the `show` method for this struct. The `show` function is a built-in function in Julia, so we need to override it using the `show` macro:\n\n```julia\nshow(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/plain\", fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, string(fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit))\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first convert the `value` field to a string using the `string` function and then concatenate it with the space character (represented as \" \") and the `unit` field. The output will be in the format \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[200,313],"elapsed":10.428204666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
