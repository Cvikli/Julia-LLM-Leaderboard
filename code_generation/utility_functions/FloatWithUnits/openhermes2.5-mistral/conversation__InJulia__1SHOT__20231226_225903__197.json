The `show` method is then defined for this struct, using the `function show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` signature.\n\nInside the `show` method, I print the value of `fwu.value` using the `print` function, which automatically converts it to a string. Then, I print the `fwu.unit` directly, since it's already a string. This will concatenate the value and unit with a space, as desired: \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[77,303],"elapsed":9.450558958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
