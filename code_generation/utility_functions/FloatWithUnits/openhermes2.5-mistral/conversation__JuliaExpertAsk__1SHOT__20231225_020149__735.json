Here's how you can define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and its `show` method in Julia:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    write(io, string(fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit))\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n1. We define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` (of type `Float64`) and `unit` (of type `String`).\n2. The `show` method is defined for the `IO` type, which represents I/O streams such as files or standard output. When we want to display an object of type `FloatWithUnits`, Julia will automatically call this `show` method.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use the `write` function to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, and then write it to the I/O stream.\n\nNow when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it, Julia will automatically call our custom show method:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[119,307],"elapsed":9.800193917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
