Here is an example of how you could implement a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nclass FloatWithUnits\n{\n    public $value;\n    public $unit;\n\n    public function __construct($value, $unit)\n    {\n        $this->value = $value;\n        $this->unit = $unit;\n    }\n\n    public function show()\n    {\n        return \"{$this->value} {$this->unit}\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method will take the `value` and `unit` fields of the struct and concatenate them with a space using the `{}` syntax. The resulting string will be in the format \"1.8 meters\".\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this method:\n```\n$floatWithUnits = new FloatWithUnits(1.8, 'meters');\necho $floatWithUnits->show(); // Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nI hope this helps!
