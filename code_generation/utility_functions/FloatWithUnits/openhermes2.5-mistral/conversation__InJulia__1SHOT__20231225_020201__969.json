The `show` method is then defined to display the value and unit separated by a space. Note that this code uses some Julia features available from version 1.7 onwards, so it can be used in newer versions of Julia without any additional changes. However, for older versions (up to version 1.6), you'll need to use `@compat` directive to ensure compatibility with the newer code.","status":200,"tokens":[77,379],"elapsed":11.855879708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
