The `show` method for this struct takes an `IO` object (such as a `IOStream`) and the `FloatWithUnits` object. It then writes to the `IO` object the concatenation of the string representation of `f.value` and `f.unit`, separated by a space.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\njulia> show(stdout, f)\n\"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[77,242],"elapsed":7.5879715,"_type":"aimessage"}]
