Here's an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction show(io::IO, ::MIME\"text/plain\", f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(f.value))\n    print(io, \" \")\n    print(io, f.unit)\nend\n```\nThis method takes an `IO` object and the MIME type `\"text/plain\"` as well as an instance of our `FloatWithUnits` struct (denoted by `f::FloatWithUnits`). It prints the value of the struct, followed by a space, and then the unit.","status":200,"tokens":[77,191],"elapsed":6.092856666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
