We define a new method `show` that takes two arguments: an `IO` object (like a standard output or file stream) and our `FloatWithUnits` struct.\n2. Inside this function, we use the `print` function to print the value of the struct concatenated with a space and the unit.\n\nNow you can use this code to display values of type `FloatWithUnits` as desired:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(io, fwu) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[119,284],"elapsed":9.109629167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
