The `show` method is then overloaded for this new type, such that when an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is printed, it will display the value followed by the unit separated by a space.\n\nHere's how you might use this struct:\n\n```julia\njulia> distance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> println(distance)\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> speed = FloatWithUnits(65.3, \"miles/hour\")\n65.3 miles/hour\n\njulia> println(speed)\n65.3 miles/hour\n```","status":200,"tokens":[86,278],"elapsed":35.95507575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
