We define a `struct` called `FloatWithUnits`, which has two fields: `value`, which is a `Float64`, and `unit`, which is a `String`.\n   \n2. We then extend the `Base.show` function for our custom type `FloatWithUnits`. This function is responsible for displaying instances of our type in the REPL and other output streams. \n\n3. Inside this function, we use `print` to write the `value` and `unit` fields of our `FloatWithUnits` instance into the specified `io` stream. The output will be formatted as \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[86,238],"elapsed":31.065097208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
