The `show` method is then overloaded for this new type, so that when it's printed to an I/O stream (like `stdout`), the value and unit are separated by a space.\n\nHere's how you can test this:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x)  # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[126,219],"elapsed":29.377836875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
