Here's how you can do it in Julia:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Write show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and use the `show` function or simply `print` to see the result:\n\n```julia\n# Create an instance\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Show the result\nprintln(x) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this code, we defined a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64`, and `unit` of type `String`. Then, we extended the `Base.show` function for our custom type `FloatWithUnits`. This method is responsible for displaying objects of this type. We use `print` to write the `value` and `unit` fields of our struct into the `io` stream, separated by a space.","status":200,"tokens":[208,291],"elapsed":62.263982959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
