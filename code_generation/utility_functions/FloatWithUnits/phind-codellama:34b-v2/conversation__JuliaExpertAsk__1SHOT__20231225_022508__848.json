Then, I extended the `Base.show` function for the `FloatWithUnits` type. This function takes an I/O stream (`io`), an instance of `FloatWithUnits` (`x`), and prints the `value` and `unit` of `x` separated by a space to the given I/O stream.","status":200,"tokens":[126,198],"elapsed":26.919773,"_type":"aimessage"}]
