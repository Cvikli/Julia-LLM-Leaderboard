The library is designed to handle various numeric data types with accompanying units of measurements.\n\nYour team has just completed implementing all the major functions and methods in the library. Your manager tasks you with a Quality Assurance (QA) test which must verify the correctness of the implementation details. You need to make sure that the `show` method for `FloatWithUnits` indeed concatenates the value and unit correctly as per its syntax rules.\n\nThe QA test should cover all possible input combinations:\n1. `FloatWithUnits` with a single value (like 1.8) and a single unit (like meters). \n2. `FloatWithUnits` with multiple values (like [1, 2, 3]) and corresponding units (like [\"m\", \"cm\", \"mm\"]).\n3. `FloatWithUnits` with negative values (like -0.6) and negative units (like [-m, -cm, -mm]). \n4. `FloatWithUnits` with non-numeric values (like NaN), and corresponding units (like [\"NaN\", \"Unit not supported\"]).\n5. `FloatWithUnits` with empty fields.\n\nYour QA test should also confirm that the function throws an appropriate error if any of these conditions are not met, like a ValueError or IndexError. \n\nQuestion: What are the steps you would follow to conduct this comprehensive and exhaustive Quality Assurance test for the `show` method?\n\n\nStart by defining all possible input combinations using Python's itertools library. For instance, to define all possible combinations of three elements from two lists, we could use the product function as follows:\n```python\nimport itertools\nvalues = [1, 2, 3]\nunits = [\"m\", \"cm\", \"mm\"]\ncombinations = list(itertools.product(values, units))\nprint(combinations)\n# Outputs: [(1, 'm'), (1, 'cm'), (1, 'mm'), (2, 'm'), ...]\n```\nThis will help generate all possible input combinations for the `show` method to be tested against.\n\nNext, write a loop over these input combinations. For each combination, call the `show` function on an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. Then use assert statements to check if the output matches the expected concatenation. If it doesn't, catch the exception and raise your custom error message with the appropriate field being empty or invalid. \n```python\nfor value, unit in combinations:\ntry:\nassert show(FloatWithUnits(value=value, unit=unit)) == str(value) + \" \" + unit\nexcept AssertionError as e:\nprint(f\"Test failed for input ({value}, {unit}): {str(e)}\")\n```\n\n\nAnswer: The steps to conduct this comprehensive QA test are defined in the two Python code examples provided.","status":200,"tokens":[107,741],"elapsed":19.909882417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
