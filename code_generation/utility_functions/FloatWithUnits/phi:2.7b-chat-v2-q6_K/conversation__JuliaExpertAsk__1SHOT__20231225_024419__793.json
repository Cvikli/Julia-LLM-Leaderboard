The company has recently purchased several plots of land each with a unique set of properties: area, number of trees and type of soil. \n\nThe data for three plots is as follows:\n\n- Plot A: 100 sq meters, 10 trees, loamy soil\n- Plot B: 1 yard, 5 trees, clayey soil\n- Plot C: 30 feet, 3 trees, sandy soil\n\nHowever, the records got mixed up and now you have to match each plot with its correct data. \n\nEach plot can only belong to one type of soil (clayey, loamy or sandy), and it has a unique number of trees (3, 5 or 10). The area is also different for each plot: 100 sq meters, 1 yard or 30 feet.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n1) Each plot has a different property.\n2) The plot with the clayey soil has more trees than the one which measures in yards but less trees than Plot B.\n3) The area of Plot A is not 100 sq meters and it does not have sandy soil.\n4) Plot C, which doesn't have loamy soil, has fewer trees than the plot measuring 30 feet.\n5) The plot with the loamy soil is bigger than the one with 3 trees but smaller than Plot B.\n6) The plot that measures in yards has more trees than the plot with sandy soil.\n\nQuestion: Can you match each plot to its correct data (soil type, number of trees and area)?\n\n\nLet's use deductive logic to solve this puzzle. \n From rule 2, we can deduce that Plot B cannot have clayey or sandy soil because it has more trees than the plot with clayey soil and less trees than another plot. Therefore, it must have loamy soil. So, the area of Plot B is 100 sq meters (as per Rule 5). \n Now, from rule 3, we know that Plot A does not have sandy or loamy soil and its area is not 100 sq meters. So, it must be clayey soil. Therefore, its area has to be 1 yard because Plot C cannot be clayey (rule 4) or loamy (as per step1). \n This means that Plot C must have sandy soil since the other two are already taken. And we know from rule 6 that the plot with sandy soil has more trees than the plot with yards, so Plot C also has 3 trees. Hence, it cannot be 100 sq meters or 1 yard (as per step2 and step3), so it must measure in 30 feet. \n Since all other areas have been assigned, Plot B must be the one that measures in feet which is not possible as we already know that plots are measured in yards, meters, and feet. Hence there's a contradiction. We need to re-examine our initial assumptions. The area of Plot A can't be 1 yard or 100 sq meters; therefore it has to be 30 feet (the only one left). \n So, the remaining plot (Plot C) must have an area of 100 sq meters because it is the last option and it does not violate any rules. Hence, Plot B must measure in yards which leaves Plot A with loamy soil but more trees than Plot C, so it has 5 trees and Plot C has 3 trees (the only number left). \nAnswer:\n- Plot A: Clayey Soil, 5 Trees, 30 feet\n- Plot B: Loamy Soil, 10 Trees, Yards\n- Plot C: Sandy Soil, 3 Trees, 100 sq meters","status":200,"tokens":[107,843],"elapsed":22.89006,"_type":"aimessage"}]
