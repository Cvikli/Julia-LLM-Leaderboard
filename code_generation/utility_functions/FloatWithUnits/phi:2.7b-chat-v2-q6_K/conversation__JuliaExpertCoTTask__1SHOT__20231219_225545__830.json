Here is my solution to the task:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return \"$($f.value)${$f.unit}.\"\nend\n\n# Examples\n FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* I defined the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n* In the `show` method, we concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields using a space. The `$()` syntax is used to wrap the field values in a string.\n* I provided an example usage of the `show` method with the creation of a new `FloatWithUnits` instance with value 1.8 and unit \"meters\".\n\nIs there anything else you would like me to help with?","status":200,"tokens":[1,225],"elapsed":7.349872,"_type":"aimessage"}]
