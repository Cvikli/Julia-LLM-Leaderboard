The catch here is, you need to sort the list of units first before sorting the values within each category. \n\nThe rules are:\n1. Meters will be at the start of the sorted list.\n2. After meters, comes the \"feet\" unit system in ascending order.\n3. Finally, after feet, comes the \"inches\" unit system in descending order.\n4. All values within a category should then be sorted in increasing order. \n\nYour challenge is to come up with an efficient algorithm for this sorting task and demonstrate how it would function on a test list of `FloatWithUnits` objects.\n\nHere's your test case:\n1. FloatWithUnits(\"1.8 meters\", \"meters\")\n2. FloatWithUnits(\"5.6 feet\", \"feet\")\n3. FloatWithUnits(\"30 inches\", \"inches\")\n4. FloatWithUnits(\"12 feet\", \"feet\")\n5. FloatWithUnits(\"1 inch\", \"inches\")\n6. FloatWithUnits(\"2 meters\", \"meters\")\n7. FloatWithUnits(\"15 feet\", \"feet\")\n8. FloatWithUnits(\"3 inches\", \"inches\")\n\nQuestion: What is the sorted list of `FloatWithUnits` objects as per the given rules?\n\n\nThe first step is to create a dictionary for each unit system that maps units in that system to an integer value (for example, 1 meter = 100, 12 inches = 1 foot). This allows us to compare values within the same unit system.\n\nNext, we sort the list of `FloatWithUnits` objects by their 'unit' field. We use a priority queue for this task, where we store the objects in the order specified by our dictionary mapping (meters > feet > inches).\n\nThen, for each group of objects with the same unit system, we sort them based on their 'value' field in ascending order using standard sorting algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort.\n\nLastly, we extract the sorted `FloatWithUnits` objects from the priority queue and store them in a new list as our final result. \n\nAnswer: The sorted list of `FloatWithUnits` objects is ['1.8 meters', '2 meters', '12 feet', '15 feet', '30 inches', '5.6 feet', '3 inches', '1 inch'].","status":200,"tokens":[107,645],"elapsed":17.167964667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
