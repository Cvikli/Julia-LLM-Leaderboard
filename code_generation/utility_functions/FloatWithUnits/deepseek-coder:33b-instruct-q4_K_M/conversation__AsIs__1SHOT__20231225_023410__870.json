This is Julia's standard way of handling output, which allows for customization by passing different types of IO streams like strings or files. \nThe second argument `fwu::FloatWithUnits` is the object that we want to show. It must be of type `FloatWithUnits`, as defined in our struct above. \nThe function `print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)` writes out the value and unit separated by a space. This is what gets displayed when you call `show()` on an object of type `FloatWithUnits`.","status":200,"tokens":[71,291],"elapsed":48.454531583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
