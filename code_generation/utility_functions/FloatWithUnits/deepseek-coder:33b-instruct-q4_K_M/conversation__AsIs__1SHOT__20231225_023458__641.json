This method takes an IO buffer and a value of type `FloatWithUnits`. It then uses `print` to write the string representation of the `value`, a space, and the `unit` into the IO buffer.\n\nNote: The `Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)` is not just for `FloatWithUnits` but for any object that you want to display in a particular way, like custom structs or types defined by you. \n\nExample usage of the code:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(stdout, fwu) # This will print \"1.8 meters\" to stdout (standard output).\nprintln(fwu)      # Also prints \"1.8 meters\". Here println() uses the show method internally for non-string values.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[71,290],"elapsed":48.240850666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
