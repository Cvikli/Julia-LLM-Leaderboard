Here's how you might implement this for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")  # create an instance of the struct\nshow(fwu)  # output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this code, we've defined a new `struct` called `FloatWithUnits` with fields for the `value` and `unit`. We then define a method for `Base.show` which takes an instance of the struct and prints it in the desired format. The `$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)` syntax is Julia's way of interpolating variables into strings, and `io::IO` is a parameter that represents where to print the output (e.g., the console or a file).","status":200,"tokens":[197,287],"elapsed":75.213030833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
