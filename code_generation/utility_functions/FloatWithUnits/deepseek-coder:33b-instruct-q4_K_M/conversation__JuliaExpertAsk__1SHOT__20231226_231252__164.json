We're using `string()` to convert the value of `fwu.value` to a string and then concatenate it with the unit separated by a space. The result is printed on the IO stream passed as the first argument, in this case `io`. \n\nNow, when you create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it out, Julia will use your custom show method:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[115,246],"elapsed":42.043428042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
