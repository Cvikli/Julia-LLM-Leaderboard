[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` and `unit` (make sure to define it!), write a `show` method for it that will concatenate the value and unit with a space like this \"1.8 meters\".\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits \n    value::Number\n    unit::AbstractString\nend\n\nimport Base.show\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) \n    print(io, string(fwu.value), \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\nIn the above solution, we have first defined a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` and `unit`. We then extended Base's `show` method to customize how instances of our struct are displayed. The method takes an IO object (which represents where the output will be printed) and a `FloatWithUnits` instance as input, concatenates their values and unit separated by a space using Julia's string interpolation, and prints the result in the given IO stream.","status":200,"tokens":[403,190],"elapsed":40.836811,"_type":"aimessage"}]
