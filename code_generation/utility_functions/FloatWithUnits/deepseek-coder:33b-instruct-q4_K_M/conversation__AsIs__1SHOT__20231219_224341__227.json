Here is an example of how you could implement a `show` method for a `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nclass FloatWithUnits\n{\n    public float value { get; set; }\n    public string unit { get; set; }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return $\"{value} {unit}\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method will take the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` struct, and concatenate them with a space in between using the `$` operator. The resulting string will be in the format \"1.8 meters\", where \"1.8\" is the value and \"meters\" is the unit.\n\nYou can test this method by creating an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and calling the `ToString()` method on it:\n```\nFloatWithUnits floatWithUnits = new FloatWithUnits { Value = 1.8f, Unit = \"meters\" };\nConsole.WriteLine(floatWithUnits); // Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.","status":200,"tokens":[1,272],"elapsed":8.570559583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
