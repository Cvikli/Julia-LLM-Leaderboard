We then overload the default `show` function provided by Julia in the `Base` module. This method takes an IO object (where data is written to) and a `FloatWithUnits` as arguments, and outputs the value and unit concatenated into a string with a space between them. The `string(fwu.value)` part of the code converts the numerical value in our struct to a string before it's outputted, so that we can easily concatenate it with the other parts.","status":200,"tokens":[71,212],"elapsed":35.612743958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
