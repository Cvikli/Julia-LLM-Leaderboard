Here is how you could implement this for your `FloatWithUnits` type:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\nIn this code, `Base.show` is a function that defines how to show a type in IO context. The function takes two arguments: an `IO` object and the object you want to display. In the body of the function, we use Julia's built-in `print` function to output the desired string to the IO object.","status":200,"tokens":[74,194],"elapsed":32.881469167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
