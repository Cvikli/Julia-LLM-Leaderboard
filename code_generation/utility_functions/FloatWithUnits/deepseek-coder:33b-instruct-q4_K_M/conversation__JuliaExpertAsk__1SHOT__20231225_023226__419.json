Then we use the built-in `show` function from Julia's Base module to create a custom output for our `FloatWithUnits` struct. \n\nWe define a new method of the `show` function that takes two arguments: an `IO` object (which is where the data will be written) and a `FloatWithUnits` object. Inside this method, we use the `println` function to print the value followed by a space and then the unit string to the IO object. The `string` function is used to convert the float value into a string so that it can be concatenated with other strings. \n\nThe \"import\" statement at the beginning of the code is necessary because Julia doesn't export its base methods like `show` by default, which means they need to be imported before you can extend them.","status":200,"tokens":[115,316],"elapsed":53.653761375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
