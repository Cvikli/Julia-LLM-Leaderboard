We first define our struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields, `value` and `unit`. \n2. Then we create a method for `Base.show()` function which is Julia's built-in function to convert any type of object to string. This method concatenates the value and unit fields separated by a space. \n\nTo use this struct, you can do:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x) # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```\nIn this example, we create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it. The output will be the value followed by the unit separated by a space as specified in our `show()` method.","status":200,"tokens":[115,248],"elapsed":42.650968833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
