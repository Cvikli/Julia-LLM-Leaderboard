You can do so by using the `@with_kw` macro provided by DataFrames.jl in order to automatically generate the accessor methods for the fields:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n@with_kw mutable struct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n\nThen, you can write a `show` method that concatenates the value and unit with a space. Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and it will automatically call the custom `show` method:\n\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[115,228],"elapsed":7.172195875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
