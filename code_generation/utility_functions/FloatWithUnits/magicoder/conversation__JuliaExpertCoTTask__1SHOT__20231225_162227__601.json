Then, implement a `show` method to print out the value and unit in the format \"1.8 meters\".\n\nHere is an example of how it could look:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\n```\nThis code defines a `FloatWithUnits` struct that takes one type parameter (`T`). The `show` function is then implemented to output the value and unit in the format specified. The `$(...)`, which uses string interpolation, is used to insert the `value` and `unit` fields into the formatted string.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this code:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[197,247],"elapsed":8.260064291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
