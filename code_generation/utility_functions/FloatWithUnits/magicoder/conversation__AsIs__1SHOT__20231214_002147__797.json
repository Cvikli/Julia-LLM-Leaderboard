Here is an example of how you could implement a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nclass FloatWithUnits\n{\n    public double value { get; set; }\n    public string unit { get; set; }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return $\"{value} {unit}\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method uses the `$` syntax to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields of the struct with a space in between. The result is a string that represents the value of the `FloatWithUnits` struct with its unit included, such as \"1.8 meters\".\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this method:\n```\nFloatWithUnits floatWithUnits = new FloatWithUnits { Value = 1.8, Unit = \"meters\" };\nconsole.WriteLine(floatWithUnits); // Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nI hope this helps!
