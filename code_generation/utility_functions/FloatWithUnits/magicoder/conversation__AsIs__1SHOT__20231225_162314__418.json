Then we implement an `__init__` method to initialize these values when creating a new instance of FloatWithUnits.\n\nNext, we define a method `show` that simply returns a string that concatenates the `value` and `unit` with a space in between. This string is then returned as expected by Python's built-in `__str__` protocol.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```python\n# Create new instance of FloatWithUnits \nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, 'meters')\nprint(fwu.show()) # Output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[73,261],"elapsed":7.987486542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
