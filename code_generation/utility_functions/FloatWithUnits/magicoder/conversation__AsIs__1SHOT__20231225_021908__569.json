The `show()` method is defined to concatenate the value and unit with a space and return it as a string. We then create an instance of our struct and call the `show()` function on it, which prints \"1.8 meters\" to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[73,189],"elapsed":5.90101525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
