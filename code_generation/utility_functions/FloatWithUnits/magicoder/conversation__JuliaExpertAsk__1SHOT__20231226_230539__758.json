This example uses \"meters\" as the unit but you can modify this to suit your needs:\n\n```julia\n# Define a struct FloatWithUnits with fields value and unit\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T}\n    value::T\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Write a method for the show function of FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)\nend\n```\nNow if you create an instance `x` of this struct and call `show`, it will output the value and unit with a space like \"1.8 meters\". Here's how you can test it:\n\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nBase.show(stdout, x)  # Outputs \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[115,221],"elapsed":7.0147855,"_type":"aimessage"}]
