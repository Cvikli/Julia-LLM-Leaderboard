The `IO` parameter corresponds to the output stream (in this case usually stdout), and the second argument is an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. \n\nThe implementation of `show` concatenates the string representation of value with the unit separated by a space, and writes it to the specified IO stream. Note that we used `string(fwu.value)` instead of `fwu.value` because we want to make sure that the `value` is printed as if it were a normal number (i.e., without quotes).","status":200,"tokens":[75,242],"elapsed":7.4774875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
