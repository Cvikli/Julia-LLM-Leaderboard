Here is an example code snippet in Julia that defines the `FloatWithUnits` struct and implements a `show` method for it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, f.value, \" \", f.unit)\n\n# Example usage\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nYou can use this code snippet as a reference to create your own `FloatWithUnits` struct and `show` method in Julia.
