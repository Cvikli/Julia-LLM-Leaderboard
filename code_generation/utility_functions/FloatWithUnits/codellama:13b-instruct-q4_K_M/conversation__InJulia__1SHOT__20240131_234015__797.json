It then concatenates the value and unit of the instance with a space in between using the `print` function, which outputs the result to the `IO` object.\n\nNote that we've also defined the `Base.show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct, rather than just defining a method for the `show` function itself. This is because the `show` method in Julia is a generic function that can be specialized for different types of objects, and we want to define a specific implementation for our `FloatWithUnits` struct.","status":200,"tokens":[0,242],"elapsed":3.284067018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
