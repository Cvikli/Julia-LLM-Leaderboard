The `print` function is used to write the output to the IO object, which is typically a console or a file.\n\nYou can use this `show` method like this:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```\nNote that the `println` function automatically adds a newline character at the end of the output, which is why the example above includes a space after the unit. If you want to avoid this, you can use the `print` function instead of `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,256],"elapsed":3.373215097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
