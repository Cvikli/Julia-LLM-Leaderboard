It uses the `print` function to concatenate the value and unit fields with a space in between using string interpolation (`\"$\"`), and then writes them to the output stream specified by the `io` argument.\n\nNow you can create instances of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and see their formatted representations:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> println(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[78,263],"elapsed":44.891621667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
