We then define an enumeration type `Unit` for meters, kilograms, and seconds. Next, we define a `FloatWithUnits` struct that contains a `Float` value and a `Unit`. The `Eq`, `Show`, and `Enum` type class instances are derived to make it easier to work with these data types in Haskell.\n\nFinally, we implement the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct. It takes the value and unit fields, concatenates them with a space in between, and returns the result as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[76,274],"elapsed":11.004822916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
