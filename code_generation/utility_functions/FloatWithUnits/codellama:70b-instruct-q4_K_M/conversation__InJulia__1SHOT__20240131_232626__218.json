I'll create a struct with fields `value` and `unit`, and then write a show method for it that displays them in the format you specified. Here's what I came up with:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64  # A floating-point number to represent the value\n    unit::String  # A string to represent the units (e.g., \"meters\")\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nNow, whenever you create a `FloatWithUnits` object and print it to the console, it will be displayed with a space between the value and units, just like this:\n\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # This prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification! üòä","status":200,"tokens":[0,250],"elapsed":13.355815342,"_type":"aimessage"}]
