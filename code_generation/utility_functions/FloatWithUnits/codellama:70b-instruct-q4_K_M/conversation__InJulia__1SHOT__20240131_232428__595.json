That being said, here's how you could define the `FloatWithUnits` struct along with the `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nNow you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and display them with the `show` method:\n\n```julia\ndistance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprint(distance)\n# Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that I'm just an AI, and while this code should work fine in Julia, it might not be the most efficient or idiomatic way to write it. Julia is still evolving, so there may be better ways to achieve your goal.
