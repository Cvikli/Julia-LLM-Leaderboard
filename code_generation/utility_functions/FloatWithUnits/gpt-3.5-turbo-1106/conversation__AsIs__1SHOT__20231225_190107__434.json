Below is an example of how you can define the `FloatWithUnits` struct in Python and implement a `show` method for it:\n\n```python\nclass FloatWithUnits:\n    def __init__(self, value, unit):\n        self.value = value\n        self.unit = unit\n    \n    def show(self):\n        return f\"{self.value} {self.unit}\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we've defined the `FloatWithUnits` class with `value` and `unit` as its fields, and implemented a `show` method that returns the string concatenating the value and unit with a space between them.","status":200,"tokens":[67,128],"elapsed":2.102742041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
