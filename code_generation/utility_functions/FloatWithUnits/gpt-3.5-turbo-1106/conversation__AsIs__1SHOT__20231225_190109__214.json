Here's a possible implementation in the Swift programming language:\n\n```swift\n// Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits {\n    var value: Double\n    var unit: String\n    func show() -> String {\n        return \"\\(value) \\(unit)\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `FloatWithUnits` struct has two fields `value` and `unit`. The `show` method takes no parameters and returns a string by concatenating the value and unit with a space in between.","status":200,"tokens":[67,107],"elapsed":1.732707708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
