Here's an example of a `FloatWithUnits` struct and a `show` method for it in the Swift programming language:\n\n```swift\nstruct FloatWithUnits {\n  var value: Double\n  var unit: String\n  \n  func show() -> String {\n    return \"\\(value) \\(unit)\"\n  }\n}\n\nlet distance = FloatWithUnits(value: 1.8, unit: \"meters\")\nprint(distance.show()) // Output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, we define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`. We then define a `show` method that returns a string concatenating the value and unit with a space in between. This method can be called on an instance of `FloatWithUnits` to display the value and unit together as a string.","status":200,"tokens":[67,171],"elapsed":3.783299625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
