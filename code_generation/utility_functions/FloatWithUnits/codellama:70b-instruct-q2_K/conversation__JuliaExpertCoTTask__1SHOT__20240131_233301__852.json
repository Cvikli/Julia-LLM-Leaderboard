You can use other types if you need them.\n    unit::String   # String type for storing units like \"meters\" or \"seconds\".\nend\n```\nShow Method: Write a `show` method for your struct, which will concatenate the value and unit with a space:\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) \n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nUsage: Create an instance of FloatWithUnits and display it using `show`:\n```julia\nmy_instance = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")  # Create an instance with value 1.8 and unit \"meters\"\nprintln(my_instance)  # Display the instance using show method\n# Output:\n# 1.8 meters\n```\n\nNote that I'm assuming that you want to display a single instance of `FloatWithUnits` using `show`. If you need to display multiple instances, or if you have other requirements, let me know and I can update the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,315],"elapsed":13.047590668,"_type":"aimessage"}]
