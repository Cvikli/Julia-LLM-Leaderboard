Define the struct FloatWithUnits:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n```\n2. Write the show method:\n```julia\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\nThe `Base.show` function is overloaded to accept a custom IO type (`io`) and an instance of the struct `FloatWithUnits`. Inside the function, we simply concatenate the value with a space and then print it using `print`, which prints the concatenated result.\n\nYou can try it out by creating an instance:\n```julia\nmy_float = FloatWithUnits(10.5, \"meters\")\nprintln(my_float) # Output: 10.5 meters\n```\nThe `show` method is called implicitly when we pass the struct to `println`. This will print the concatenated result as required.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":9.686487647,"_type":"aimessage"}]
