We define a new struct `FloatWithUnits`, which has two fields - `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`.\n2. We define a function `show` that takes an input stream `io` (of type IO) and an instance of our `FloatWithUnits` struct (named `fwu`) as arguments.\n3. Inside the `show` method, we use the `print` function to print out the value and unit separated by a space character. The `$(...)` syntax is used for string interpolation.\n\nNow, when you call the `show` method on an instance of your struct like this: `show(io, MyInstanceOfFloatWithUnits)`, it will output \"1.8 meters\" (or any other value and unit you provide).","status":200,"tokens":[70,283],"elapsed":9.01819975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
