We start by defining the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`. The `value` is defined as a `Float64`, and the `unit` is defined as a `String`.\n2. We then define a function called `show`, which is a method that belongs to the `Base` module. This method takes an input stream `io` and a `FloatWithUnits` instance `fwu` as arguments.\n3. Inside this method, we use the `print` function with the input stream `io` and the string representation of the `value` field of the `fwu` instance, followed by a space character `\" \"`, and finally the value of the `unit` field of the `fwu` instance. This will result in the desired output format: \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[70,287],"elapsed":9.116962458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
