Here's a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct that you can use:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(f.value))\n    print(io, \" \")\n    print(io, f.unit)\nend\n```\nThis `show` method will take an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and output a formatted string with the value and unit separated by a space. For example, given the input `(1.8, \"meters\")`, the output would be `\"1.8 meters\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[121,162],"elapsed":5.409485584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
