Here's the definition of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and the `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(fwu.value))\n    print(io, \" \")\n    print(io, fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis will allow you to display `FloatWithUnits` objects as desired. For example:\n\n```julia\nFWU = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(FWU)  # Outputs: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method is a part of the standard library and can be overridden for custom types like `FloatWithUnits`.","status":200,"tokens":[121,195],"elapsed":6.403848083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
