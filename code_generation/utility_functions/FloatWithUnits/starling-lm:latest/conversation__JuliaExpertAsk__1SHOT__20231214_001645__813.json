Here is a possible implementation of the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nshow(f::FloatWithUnits) = string(f.value) * \" \" * f.unit\n```\nThis will concatenate the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` struct using a space in between. For example, if you call the `show` method on an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with `value` equal to 1.8 and `unit` equal to \"meters\", it will return the string \"1.8 meters\".\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[105,150],"elapsed":5.494302916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
