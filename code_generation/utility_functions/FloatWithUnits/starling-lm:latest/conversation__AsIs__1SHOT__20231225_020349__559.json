This allows you to use the `print!` or `println!` macros with a `FloatWithUnits` instance, and it will automatically format the value and unit with a space in between:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let f = FloatWithUnits {\n        value: 1.8,\n        unit: \"meters\".to_string(),\n    };\n    println!(\"The value of f is: {}\", f);\n}\n```\n\nThis code will output the following text:\n```\nThe value of f is: 1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[76,274],"elapsed":8.623154042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
