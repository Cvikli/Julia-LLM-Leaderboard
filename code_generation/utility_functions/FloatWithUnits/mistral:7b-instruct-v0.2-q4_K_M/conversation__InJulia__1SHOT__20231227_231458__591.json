This method will print the value and unit with a space between them:\n\n```julia\nfunction show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, string(f.value), \" \", f.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method accepts an `IO` object (input/output stream) as its first argument and the `FloatWithUnits` struct as its second argument. It then prints the value and unit separated by a space using the `print` function with formatted strings.","status":200,"tokens":[70,206],"elapsed":8.385271916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
