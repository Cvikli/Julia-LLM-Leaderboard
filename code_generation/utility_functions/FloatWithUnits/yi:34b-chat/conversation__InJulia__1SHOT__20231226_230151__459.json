Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits{T <: Real, U <: Unitful.AbstractUnit}\n    value::T\n    unit::U\nend\n\n# Define a string representation of the struct\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `<: Real` in the type parameter `T` is a Julia way to say that `T` must be a subtype of `Real` (e.g., `Float64` or `Int`).\n- `U <: Unitful.AbstractUnit` is a similar constraint for the type `U`, ensuring it's a subtype of `Unitful.AbstractUnit` (which is an abstract type defining units in the `Unitful.jl` package).\n- The `Base.show` method is defined to take an `IO` object (which could be `stdout` for printing to the screen) and a `FloatWithUnits` instance, `fwu`. It then prints out the value followed by the unit.\n\nYou can use this struct as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing Unitful # if not already imported\n\n# Example usage\nx = FloatWithUnits(2.5, meter)  # Assuming you want to define the units in terms of Unitful's `meter`\nprintln(\"The value is: \", x)   # This will print \"The value is: 2.5 meters\"\n```\n\nPlease note that I've assumed you have already imported `Unitful` if you intend to use its units. If not, you can replace the `meter` with a custom unit or adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[78,431],"elapsed":57.152245,"_type":"aimessage"}]
