Here is an example of how you could define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nclass FloatWithUnits\n    include Displayable\n\n    attribute :value, Float\n    attribute :unit, Symbol\n\n    def show\n        \"#{value} #{unit}\"\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this example, we're using the `include Displayable` module to provide a default implementation of the `show` method. The method takes no arguments, so it simply returns the concatenation of the `value` and `unit` attributes with a space in between.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nfloat_with_units = FloatWithUnits.new(value: 1.8, unit: \"meters\")\nputs float_with_units.show # Output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\nI hope this helps!
