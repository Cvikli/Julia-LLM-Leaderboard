Here is an example of how you could define a `show` method in Julia for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value :: Float64\n    unit   :: String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return \"$($(f.value)) $(f.unit)\"\nend\n```\nHere's how you can use the `show` method:\n```\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f.show()) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nThe `show` method takes advantage of Julia's syntax for function calls with multiple arguments, which allows you to concatenate the value and unit using the `$()` operator. The `(f.value)` and `(f.unit)` parts of the expression are evaluated as expressions, and then concatenated with a space using the `($( )` operator.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.","status":200,"tokens":[75,231],"elapsed":7.818332125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
