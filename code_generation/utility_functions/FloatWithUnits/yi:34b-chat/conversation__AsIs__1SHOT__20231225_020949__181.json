The `FloatWithUnits` struct will have two fields: one for the floating-point value and another for the unit.\n\nHere's how you might define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and implement the `std::fmt::Display` trait (which is what is used by the `println!` macro to format values):\n\n```rust\nuse std::fmt;\n\n#[derive(Debug)] // This allows us to use `{:?}` formatting with this type\nstruct FloatWithUnits {\n    value: f64,\n    unit: String,\n}\n\nimpl fmt::Display for FloatWithUnits {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {\n        write!(f, \"{} {}s\", self.value, self.unit)\n    }\n}\n\n// Create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and print it using `println!`:\nlet distance = FloatWithUnits{ value: 1.8, unit: \"meters\".to_string() };\nprintln!(\"The distance is: {:?}\", distance); // This will use the Debug trait by default\nprintln!(\"The distance is: {}\", distance); // This uses the Display trait implementation we just wrote\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you should see output like this:\n\n```text\nThe distance is: FloatWithUnits { value: 1.8, unit: \"meters\" }\nThe distance is: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThe `show` method in Rust is typically referred to as the `Display` trait's `fmt` method. The `Debug` trait also has a `fmt` method, which is why you see the debug output when printing with `{:?}`.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes you are using Rust 2018 or later, as the `std::fmt::Display` trait was automatically implemented for types that could be formatted by the compiler in earlier versions of Rust. If you're using an older version, you will need to add the following line to your code:\n\n```rust\nuse std::fmt::Display;\n```\n\nAnd then implement `Display` manually:\n\n```rust\nimpl Display for FloatWithUnits {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> Result {\n        // Your implementation here...\n    }\n}\n```","status":200,"tokens":[75,561],"elapsed":74.673231958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
