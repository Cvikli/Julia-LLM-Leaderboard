Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) ${(fwu.unit)}\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this definition, `FloatWithUnits` has two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`. The custom `show` method is then defined using the `Base.show` macro to output the value and unit when printing the struct.\n\nNow you can use this struct as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> float_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nWhen printed, `FloatWithUnits` will display the value and unit separated by a space, as desired.","status":200,"tokens":[78,247],"elapsed":33.922909,"_type":"aimessage"}]
