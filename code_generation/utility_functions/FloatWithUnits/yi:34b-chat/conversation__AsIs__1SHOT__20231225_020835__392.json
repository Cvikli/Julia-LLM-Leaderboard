When you call `println!` with a format string containing `{}`, it will use the `fmt::Display` implementation if it is available. Since we've implemented `fmt::Display` for our `FloatWithUnits` struct, it will be used when printing.\n\nThe `show` method in this context is not a specific Rust term; it's a hypothetical term you've used to describe the behavior of the `fmt::Display` trait. The `fmt::Display` trait provides a way to convert a value into a string representation that can be written to a stream (like standard output).\n\nRemember to import the `fmt` module from the standard library using `use std::fmt;` so you can implement the traits defined within it.","status":200,"tokens":[75,412],"elapsed":54.891645959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
