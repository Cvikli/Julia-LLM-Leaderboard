Here is an example of how you could define a `show` method for a `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nclass FloatWithUnits\n{\n    public $value;\n    public $unit;\n\n    public function show()\n    {\n        return $this->value . \" \" . $this->unit;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will take the `value` and `unit` fields of the struct and concatenate them with a space in between, like you requested.\n\nFor example, if you have a instance of `FloatWithUnits` called `$floatWithUnits`, you can call its `show()` method to get the output \"1.8 meters\".\n```\n$floatWithUnits = new FloatWithUnits(1.8, 'meters');\necho $floatWithUnits->show(); // Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[59,213],"elapsed":7.061512708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
