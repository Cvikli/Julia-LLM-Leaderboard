Start by defining an `instance Show FloatWithUnits where` and then write the body of the `show` method inside, but don't forget to include a type declaration!\n2. Don't forget that in order to format a float with only one decimal place you will need to use `:.1f`, which we covered before.\n3. If you need to, consult the [Float documentation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Float) from GHCi. It can be very helpful!","status":200,"tokens":[54,141],"elapsed":7.874451167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
