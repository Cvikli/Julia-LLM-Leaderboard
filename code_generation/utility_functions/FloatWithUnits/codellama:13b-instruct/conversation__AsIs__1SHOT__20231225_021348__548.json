The `show` method is an implementation of the `Display` trait for `FloatWithUnits`, which allows us to use the `{}` placeholder in the `println!` macro to call the `show` method and display the value and unit as a string.\n\nThe `format!(\"{} {}\", self.value, self.unit)` line inside the `show` method is used to format the output of the `FloatWithUnits` struct. The first argument is a string that contains placeholders for the values of `self.value` and `self.unit`, separated by a space. The second argument is a tuple containing the actual values of `self.value` and `self.unit`.\n\nThe `println!` macro is used to display the output of the `show` method in the console.","status":200,"tokens":[81,345],"elapsed":19.011302916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
