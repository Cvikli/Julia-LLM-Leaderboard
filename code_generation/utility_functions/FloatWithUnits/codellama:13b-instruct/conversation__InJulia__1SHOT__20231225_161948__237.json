The body of the method simply prints out the `value` field followed by a space and then the `unit` field.\n\nYou can use this method to print out instances of the `FloatWithUnits` struct in any way you like, such as:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(x) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[83,219],"elapsed":12.250674583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
