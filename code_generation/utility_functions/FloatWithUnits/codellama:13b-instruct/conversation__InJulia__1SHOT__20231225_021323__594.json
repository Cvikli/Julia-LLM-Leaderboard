It then concatenates the value of the `value` field with the unit string in the `unit` field, separated by a space character. The resulting string is then printed to the `io` stream using the `println` function.\n\nHere's an example usage of this implementation:\n```julia\nx = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(IOContext(:compact => true), x) # prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[83,233],"elapsed":13.029851959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
