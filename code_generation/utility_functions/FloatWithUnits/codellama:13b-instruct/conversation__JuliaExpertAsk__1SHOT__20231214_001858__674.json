Here is an example implementation of the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value :: Float64\n    unit   :: String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return string(\"$f $unit\")\nend\n```\nIn this implementation, we use the `$` symbol to format the `value` field as a float and the `string` function to concatenate it with the `unit` field. The result is a string in the format \"1.8 meters\".\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[105,145],"elapsed":5.336470292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
