The `print` function is used to output the result to the screen or any other IO stream. The `string` function is used to convert the `value` and `unit` fields into strings before concatenating them.\n\nYou can also use the `println` function instead of `print` if you want to print a newline character after the output.","status":200,"tokens":[83,198],"elapsed":11.089757458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
