Here is an example of how you could implement a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return string(f.value, \" $\", f.unit)\nend\n```\nThis will output the value of the `FloatWithUnits` struct followed by a space and then the unit, separated by a dollar sign. For example:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(show(f)) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[1,173],"elapsed":5.415655334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
