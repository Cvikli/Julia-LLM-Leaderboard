Here is an example of how you could define a `show` method for a `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nclass FloatWithUnits\n    attr_accessor :value, :unit\n\n    def initialize(value:, unit:)\n        @value = value\n        @unit = unit\n    end\n\n    def show\n        \"#{@value} #{@unit}\"\n    end\nend\n```\nThis will define a `FloatWithUnits` class with an `initialize` method that takes two arguments: `value` and `unit`. The `show` method simply concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields using a space, resulting in a string that represents the value with its unit.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this `FloatWithUnits` class:\n```\nfloat_with_units = FloatWithUnits.new(value: 1.8, unit: \"meters\")\nputs float_with_units.show # Prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```\nI hope this helps!
