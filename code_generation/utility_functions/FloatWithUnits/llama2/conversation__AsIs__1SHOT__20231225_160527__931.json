Here is an example of how you could implement a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nclass FloatWithUnits\n{\n    public double value { get; set; }\n    public string unit { get; set; }\n\n    public string Show()\n    {\n        return $\"{value} {unit}\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will create a method called `Show` that takes no arguments and returns a string that concatenates the value and unit of the struct using a dollar sign (`$`) to create a formatted string. The resulting string will be in the format \"1.8 meters\".\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!","status":200,"tokens":[1,168],"elapsed":5.221150917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
