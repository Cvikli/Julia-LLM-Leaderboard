Here's a concise solution using the latest syntax of Julia:\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return \"$($f.value) $f.unit\"\nend\n```\nThat's it! Now you can use the `show` method to concatenate the value and unit of any `FloatWithUnits` struct like this:\n```julia\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(show(f)) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nNote that I've defined the `show` method to return a string by concatenating the value and unit using the `$` symbol, which is a safe way to escape any special characters in the strings.","status":200,"tokens":[105,190],"elapsed":6.663438167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
