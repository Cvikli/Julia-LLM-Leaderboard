Here's an example of how you could define a `show` method in Julia for a struct `FloatWithUnits`:\n```\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value :: Float64\n    unit   :: String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return string(\"$($f.value)$ units $f.unit\")\nend\n```\nHere's how you can use the `show` method:\n```\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f) # Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nThe `string` function is used to concatenate the value and unit with a space in between. The `$()` syntax is used to insert the value and unit into the string.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use the `format` function to achieve the same result:\n```\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return format(\"$($f.value)$ $f.unit\")\nend\n```\nBoth of these approaches will give you the output \"1.8 meters\".
