Here is an example of how you could define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct in Julia:\n```\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return \"$($f.value) $f.unit\"\nend\n```\nThis will output \"1.8 meters\" for the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value` of 1.8 and `unit` of \"meters\".\n\nAlternatively, you could use the `String` function to concatenate the value and unit with a space, like this:\n```\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return String($f.value) + \" $f.unit\"\nend\n```\nBoth of these methods should work as expected, and you can use them to display the value and unit of the `FloatWithUnits` struct in a friendly way.
