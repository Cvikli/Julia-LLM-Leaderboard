Here is an example of how you could implement a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return \"$($f.value)$ {$f.unit}\".to_string()\nend\n```\nThis will take the `value` and `unit` fields of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and concatenate them with a space, resulting in a string representation of the value with its unit. For example, if you have a `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value = 1.8` and `unit = \"meters\"`, then calling `show(f)` will return the string \"1.8 meters\".\n\nNote that I've used the `to_string()` method to convert the `Float64` value to a string, as `show` is expected to return a string. If you wanted to return a `String` object directly, you could modify the function signature to `show(f::FloatWithUnits) = \"$($f.value)$ {$f.unit}\"`.","status":200,"tokens":[105,259],"elapsed":9.055263166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
