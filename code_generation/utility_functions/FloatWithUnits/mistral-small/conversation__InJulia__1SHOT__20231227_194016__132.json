The method prints the `value` and `unit` fields of `fwu` with a space in between, using the `print` function. The `io` argument specifies the output stream where the string should be printed. By default, if `io` is not specified, the output will be printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[72,233],"elapsed":3.215200791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
