The `%f` verb is used to format the `value` field as a floating-point number with 6 digits after the decimal point, and the `%s` verb is used to include the `unit` field as a string. The `show` method then returns the resulting string.","status":200,"tokens":[70,175],"elapsed":2.535954209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
