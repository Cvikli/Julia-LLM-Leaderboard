First, let's define the `FloatWithUnits` struct in Julia. Then, we'll create a custom `show` method for it that formats the output as you requested.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define the show method for the struct\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fu.value, \" \", fu.unit)\nend\n\n# Example usage\nfu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fu)  # This will output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a struct `FloatWithUnits` with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`. Then, we extend the `Base.show` method to customize the display of `FloatWithUnits` instances. When you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, it will now display the value and unit separated by a space, as per your request.","status":200,"tokens":[70,228],"elapsed":18.314492416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
