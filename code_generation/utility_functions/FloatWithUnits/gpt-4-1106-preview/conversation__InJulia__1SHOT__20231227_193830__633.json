In Julia, you can define a struct with the necessary fields and then extend the `show` function to have your `FloatWithUnits` struct displayed in the desired format. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Extend the Base.show function for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fu.value, \" \", fu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nThis `show` method will be called automatically when you're trying to print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, or when such an instance is displayed at the REPL. With this, creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and printing it will look like this:\n\n```julia\n# Example usage\nmyMeasurement = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(myMeasurement) # This will output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nJulia will call the appropriate `show` method for our `FloatWithUnits` type that concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space.","status":200,"tokens":[70,240],"elapsed":27.533365208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
