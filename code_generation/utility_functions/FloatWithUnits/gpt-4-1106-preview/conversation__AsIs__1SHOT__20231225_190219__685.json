Below is the code that does just that:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n  value::Float64\n  unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n  print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_measurement = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(my_measurement)  # This would output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nHere, I've defined a `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`. The `show` method is extended for our new type `FloatWithUnits` to display the struct as you've described. The `io::IO` is a parameter representing the output stream to write to, and `fwu` is our instance of `FloatWithUnits`. We then use string interpolation to create the output string and print it to `io`.\n\nRemember to adjust the types of `value` or `unit` if necessary to fit your specific requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[67,254],"elapsed":14.292881333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
