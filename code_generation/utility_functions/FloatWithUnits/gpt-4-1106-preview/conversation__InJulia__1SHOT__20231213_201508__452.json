Below is the code that achieves this:\n\n```julia\n# Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define the show method for the FloatWithUnits struct\nBase.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\n\n# Example usage:\nfloat_with_units = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(float_with_units)  # This will print: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n\n1. We define a struct `FloatWithUnits` that holds a `Float64` for the `value` and a `String` for the `unit`.\n2. We then extend the `Base.show` method which is used by Julia to convert objects to human-readable strings. The first argument, `io::IO`, indicates the IO stream to print to (e.g., the console). The second argument, `fwu::FloatWithUnits`, is the instance of the struct that we want to display.\n3. Inside our custom `show` method, we use the `print` function to send the formatted string to the `IO` stream, concatenating the `value` and `unit` with a space in between.\n\nPlease note that defining custom `show` methods will affect how the instances are displayed in the REPL, when printed, and in various other contexts where the object is implicitly converted to a string.","status":200,"tokens":[70,340],"elapsed":28.325900875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
