Here's an example of how you might define it in Swift:\n\n```swift\nstruct FloatWithUnits {\n    var value: Float\n    var unit: String\n}\n```\n\nNow we can define the `show` method as a computed property:\n\n```swift\nextension FloatWithUnits {\n    var description: String {\n        return \"\\(value) \\(unit)\"\n    }\n\n    func show() {\n        print(description)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `description` computed property returns a string that is the concatenation of the `value` and `unit`, separated by a space. The `show` method simply prints this description to the console. Note that Swift's default printing behavior will call the `description` property when you print an instance of `FloatWithUnits`. So, you can also just print the instance directly instead of calling the `show` method.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```swift\nlet length = FloatWithUnits(value: 1.8, unit: \"meters\")\nprint(length) // prints \"1.8 meters\"\nlength.show() // same thing as above\n```","status":200,"tokens":[67,290],"elapsed":16.218116042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
