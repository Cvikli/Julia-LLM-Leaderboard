The method takes a single argument of type `FloatWithUnits`, which is destructured into its component parts, `value` and `unit`. The resulting string is created by using the `++` operator (concatenation) to join `show value`, a space (\" \"), and `unit`.","status":200,"tokens":[67,197],"elapsed":11.024795792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
