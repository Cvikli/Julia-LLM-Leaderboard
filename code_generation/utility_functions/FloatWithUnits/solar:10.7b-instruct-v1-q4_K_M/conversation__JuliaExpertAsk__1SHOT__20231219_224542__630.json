The `$` symbol is used to indicate that the following text should be treated as a formula, rather than a plain string.\n\nFor example, if we call the `show` method on an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct with `value = 1.8` and `unit = \"meters\"`, it will return the string \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[105,191],"elapsed":6.786423708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
