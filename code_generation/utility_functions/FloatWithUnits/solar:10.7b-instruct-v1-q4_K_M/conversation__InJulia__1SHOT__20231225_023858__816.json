We use the macro `@show` to define this method. It will accept an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct as its argument and return a formatted string that concatenates the value and unit:\n\n```julia\n@show FloatWithUnits(f) = \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\"\n```\n\nNow, let's create an instance of our `FloatWithUnits` struct to test our custom `show` method:\n\n```julia\npoint = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(point) # Output should be \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nBy defining the `@show` macro for our `FloatWithUnits` struct, we have created a custom function that displays the struct in the desired format. In this case, it concatenates the value and unit with a space between them.","status":200,"tokens":[79,299],"elapsed":17.741439833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
