Within the function, we concatenate the value field (`fwu.value`) and unit field (`fwu.unit`) with a space between them using string interpolation. This ensures that when this struct is printed or displayed, it will appear in the desired format \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[121,170],"elapsed":10.639359958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
