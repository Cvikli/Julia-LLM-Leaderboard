Here's the implementation in Swift:\n\n```swift\nextension FloatWithUnits {\n    func show() -> String {\n        return \"\\(self.value) \\(self.unit)\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis method accesses the `FloatWithUnits` struct's internal properties and returns a new string with the formatted value and unit when called. For example, if we have an instance of `FloatWithUnits` like this:\n\n```swift\nlet myData = FloatWithUnits(value: 1.8, unit: \"meters\")\n```\n\nWe can call the show method to get the formatted string:\n\n```swift\nprint(myData.show()) // Output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[77,286],"elapsed":16.936606583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
