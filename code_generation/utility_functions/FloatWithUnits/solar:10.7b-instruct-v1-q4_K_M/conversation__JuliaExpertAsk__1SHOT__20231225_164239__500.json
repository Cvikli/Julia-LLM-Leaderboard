It takes an IO object (typically a terminal or file handle) as its first argument and the struct instance as its second argument. The implementation concatenates the value and unit fields with a space using string interpolation, then writes the result to the output stream `io` via `println`.","status":200,"tokens":[121,148],"elapsed":9.394633875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
