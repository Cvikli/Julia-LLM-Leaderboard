Here is an example of how you could define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nclass FloatWithUnits\n{\n    public float value { get; set; }\n    public string unit { get; set; }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return $\"{value} {unit}\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method takes advantage of the `string.Format` method to concatenate the value and unit with a space in between, resulting in a string representation of the `FloatWithUnits` struct that includes both the value and unit.\n\nFor example, if you have a `FloatWithUnits` struct called `myFloat` with values 1.8 and units \"meters\", it will output \"1.8 meters\" when you call the `ToString()` method on it.\n```\n FloatWithUnits myFloat = new FloatWithUnits { value = 1.8f, unit = \"meters\" };\n Console.WriteLine(myFloat); // Output: 1.8 meters\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","status":200,"tokens":[1,265],"elapsed":8.336851292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
