Here is an example of how you could implement the `show` method in Julia:\n```\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$($fwu.value)$ $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nThis will output the value of `fwu.value` followed by the unit of measurement `fwu.unit`, separated by a space. For example, if you call `show` on an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with `value = 1.8` and `unit = \"meters\"`, it will output \"1.8 meters\".\n\nYou can also use the `String` function to concatenate the value and unit into a single string, like this:\n```\nfunction show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    return String(\"$($fwu.value)$ $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\nBoth of these approaches will give you the desired output of \"1.8 meters\".
