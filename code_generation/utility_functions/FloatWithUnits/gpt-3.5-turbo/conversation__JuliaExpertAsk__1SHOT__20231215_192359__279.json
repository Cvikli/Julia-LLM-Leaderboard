Here's an example implementation of the `FloatWithUnits` struct with a `show` method:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nBase.show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits) = print(io, x.value, \" \", x.unit)\n```\n\nWith this implementation, you can create instances of `FloatWithUnits` and display them using the `show` function:\n\n```julia\njulia> x = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> show(x)\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.","status":200,"tokens":[105,147],"elapsed":3.799888417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
