The `show` method is then called on the instance of the struct to get its string representation.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `unit` field of the struct is a `String`. If the `unit` field is a different type, you may need to modify the `show` method accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,219],"elapsed":1.943594978,"_type":"aimessage"}]
