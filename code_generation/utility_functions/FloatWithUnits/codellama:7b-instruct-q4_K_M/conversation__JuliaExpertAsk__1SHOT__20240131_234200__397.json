It then prints the value of the `value` field followed by a space and the value of the `unit` field using the `print` function from the `IO` package.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `unit` field is a string, which may not be the case in your application. If the `unit` field can be any type, you may need to use a more flexible approach to handle it.","status":200,"tokens":[0,212],"elapsed":1.908939141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
