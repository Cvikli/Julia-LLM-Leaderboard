The `io` argument is used to specify the output stream (in this case, the default output stream). The `fwu` argument is the struct instance that contains the `value` and `unit` fields.\n\nYou can use this method like this:\n```julia\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nshow(fwu) # Outputs \"1.8 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":1.775336379,"_type":"aimessage"}]
