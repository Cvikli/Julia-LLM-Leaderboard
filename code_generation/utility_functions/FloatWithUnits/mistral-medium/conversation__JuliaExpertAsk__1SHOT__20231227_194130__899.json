For example:\n```\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\njulia> show(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```\nNote that the `print` function is used instead of `println`, because `println` would add an extra newline at the end. If you want the output to be on a new line, you can replace `print` with `println` in the `show` method.","status":200,"tokens":[113,242],"elapsed":17.340537667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
