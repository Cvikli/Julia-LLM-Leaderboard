Here's how you can define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and the `show` method in Rust:\n```rust\nstruct FloatWithUnits {\n    value: f64,\n    unit: String,\n}\n\nimpl FloatWithUnits {\n    fn new(value: f64, unit: &str) -> Self {\n        FloatWithUnits {\n            value,\n            unit: String::from(unit),\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn show(&self) -> String {\n        format!(\"{} {}\", self.value, self.unit)\n    }\n}\n```\nYou can use the `new` method to create a new instance of `FloatWithUnits`, and the `show` method to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```rust\nlet f = FloatWithUnits::new(1.8, \"meters\");\nprintln!(\"{}\", f.show()); // prints \"1.8 meters\"\n```\nI hope that helps!
