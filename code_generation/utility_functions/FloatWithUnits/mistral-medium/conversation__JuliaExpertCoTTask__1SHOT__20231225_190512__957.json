Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with two fields: `value` and `unit`.\n2. Define the `show` function for `FloatWithUnits` using the `Base.show` function from Julia's Base library.\n3. Inside the `show` function, concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space between them.\n4. Return the concatenated string as the output of the `show` function.\n\nStep 2: Write functions and other code\n\n```julia\n# Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define a custom show method for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve the task\n\nNow that the custom `show` method is defined, using the `FloatWithUnits` struct will automatically display the value and unit together with a space between them.\n\n```julia\n# Create a FloatWithUnits object\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Display the FloatWithUnits object\nprintln(fwu)\n```\n\nStep 4: Check that your solution is correct\n\nWhen I run the code above, the output should be:\n\n```\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[195,369],"elapsed":8.83062675,"_type":"aimessage"}]
