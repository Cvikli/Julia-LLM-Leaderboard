Think through your approach step by step:\n\n   We need to define the `FloatWithUnits` struct and then write a `show` method for it. The `show` method will take the `value` and `unit` fields and concatenate them with a space in between.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\n# Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Define the show method for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n   Create a `FloatWithUnits` instance and print it using the custom `show` method.\n\n```julia\n# Create a FloatWithUnits instance\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Print the FloatWithUnits instance\nprintln(fwu)\n```\n\n4.
