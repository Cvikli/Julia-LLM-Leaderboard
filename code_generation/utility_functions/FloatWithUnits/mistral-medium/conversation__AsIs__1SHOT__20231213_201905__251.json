We then implement the `show` method for this struct using the `impl` keyword.\n\nThe `show` method takes a reference to `self` as its argument and returns a `String` that contains the formatted value and unit. We use the `format!` macro to concatenate the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between. The `:.2` inside the curly braces is a format specifier that tells Rust to display the `value` with two decimal places.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this struct and the `show` method:\n```\nlet f = FloatWithUnits { value: 1.8, unit: \"meters\".to_string() };\nprintln!(\"The length is: {}\", f.show());\n```\nOutput:\n```\nThe length is: 1.80 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[71,322],"elapsed":46.159402583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
