Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with fields `value` and `unit`.\n2. Write a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` type that takes an IO stream and an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, and prints the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between.\n3. Test the `show` method on the example data `FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")` to make sure it prints \"1.8 meters\".\n\nHere's the code:\n```\n# Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Write the show method for FloatWithUnits\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fwu.value, \" \", fwu.unit)\nend\n\n# Test the show method on the example data\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(fwu)  # Output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\nConfirmation: The output of the last line of code is \"1.8 meters\", which confirms that the `show` method works as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[195,291],"elapsed":34.521952708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
