Then it overrides the `show` method for this type so that it prints out the value followed by a space and then the unit. The `print(io, ...)` function is used to print the string representation of `fwu.value` and `fwu.unit`, followed by a space in between, onto `io`.","status":200,"tokens":[75,193],"elapsed":10.085114542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
