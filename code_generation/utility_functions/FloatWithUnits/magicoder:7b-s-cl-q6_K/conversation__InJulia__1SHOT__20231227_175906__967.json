The `show` method concatenates the `value` and `unit` with a space in between them and prints it to the stream.\n\nHere's how you can use this code:\n\n```julia\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n\njulia> typeof(fwu)\nFloatWithUnits{Float64}\n```","status":200,"tokens":[75,225],"elapsed":11.698362875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
