The `show` function is then defined to take in an IO stream and a FloatWithUnits object, which prints the value and unit of that object separated by a space. \n\nYou can now test this method as follows:\n\n```julia\njulia> f = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n1.8 meters\n```\n\nAs you can see from the output, the `show` function correctly concatenates the value and unit of the object with a space in between.","status":200,"tokens":[115,259],"elapsed":13.645593875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
