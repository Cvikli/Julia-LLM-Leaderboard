A `show` function is then defined which takes an IO object (the output stream), a FloatWithUnits object (`fwu`) and prints out its value followed by its unit in a space separated format.\n\nFinally, we create an instance of FloatWithUnits `fwu` with the given data, and print it out using `println`. The output will be \"1.8 meters\" as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[197,226],"elapsed":12.534404,"_type":"aimessage"}]
