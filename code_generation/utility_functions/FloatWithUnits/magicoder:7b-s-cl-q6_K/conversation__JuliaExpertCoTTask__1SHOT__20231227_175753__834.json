We then implement a `show` method for this type. This function takes an IO stream (`io::IO`) as its first argument, followed by an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, `f::FloatWithUnits`. In the body of the function, we print the `value` and `unit` fields separated by a space to the provided IO stream.\n\nWe then create an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, `f`, with value 1.8 and unit \"meters\", and call `println(f)` on it which invokes our custom `show` method, printing \"1.8 meters\" to the console as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[197,288],"elapsed":15.691781042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
