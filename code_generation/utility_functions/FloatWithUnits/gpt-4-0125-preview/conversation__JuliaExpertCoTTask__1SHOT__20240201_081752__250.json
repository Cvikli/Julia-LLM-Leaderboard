Define the `FloatWithUnits` struct, ensuring it has `value` and `unit` fields.\n2. Override the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct to format the output as required.\n\n### Writing the code\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f: FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example usage\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # This should print \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\n### Solving the task\nThe solution involves defining the `FloatWithUnits` struct and then overriding the `show` method to ensure that it prints the `value` followed by the `unit`, separated by a space.\n\n### Checking the solution is correct\n1. Instantiate a `FloatWithUnits` object with the provided data: `1.8` and `\"meters\"`.\n2. Call `println(f)` to print the object.\n3. The output should be exactly \"1.8 meters\", matching the task requirement.","status":200,"tokens":[174,248],"elapsed":28.017765042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
