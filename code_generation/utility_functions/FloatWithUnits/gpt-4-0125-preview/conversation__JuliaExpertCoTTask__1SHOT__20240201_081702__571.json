Think through your approach step by step\n\n- Define the struct `FloatWithUnits` with fields `value` (which should be a floating point number) and `unit` (which should be a string).\n- Implement a custom `show` method for this struct that formats its representation as \"value units\". This means, for a `FloatWithUnits` instance with `value` of 1.8 and `unit` of \"meters\", it should return \"1.8 meters\".\n\n### 2. Write any functions and other code you need\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Step 2: Implement the show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fwu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(fwu.value) $(fwu.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\n### 3. Solve the task\n\nWith the above definitions, we can now instantiate `FloatWithUnits` with given data and rely on the custom `show` method to display it as required.\n\n### 4. Check that your solution is correct\n\nChecking with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nexample = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(example)  # Expected output: \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nBy running the above code, it should display the object as \"1.8 meters\", which confirms the `show` method works as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[174,316],"elapsed":25.714918,"_type":"aimessage"}]
