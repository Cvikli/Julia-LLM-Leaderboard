Here is an example of how you could implement the `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return \"$=$(f.value) $f.unit\"\nend\n```\nThis will output the value of `f.value` followed by the unit of measurement, separated by a space. For example, if you call `show(FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\"))`, it will output \"1.8 meters\".","status":200,"tokens":[1,137],"elapsed":4.283502375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
