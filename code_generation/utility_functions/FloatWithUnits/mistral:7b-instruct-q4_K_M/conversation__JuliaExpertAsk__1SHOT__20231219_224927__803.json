Here's an example of how you could define a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct:\n```\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(f::FloatWithUnits)\n    return string(\"$($f.value) $($f.unit)\")\nend\n```\nThis will output \"1.8 meters\" when passed the struct `FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")`.\n\nNote that I've used `$` to insert a dollar sign before the value and unit, which is necessary for Julia to display the value and unit correctly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,147],"elapsed":4.606047125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
