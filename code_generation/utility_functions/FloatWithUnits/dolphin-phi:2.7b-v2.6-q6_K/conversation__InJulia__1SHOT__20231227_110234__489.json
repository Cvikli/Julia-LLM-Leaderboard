The `value` field is a numeric type, `Float64`, and the `unit` field is a string type. \n\nThen, we define a function `show(f::FloatWithUnits)` which takes an instance of `FloatWithUnits` as input. This function uses the `#{}` operator to convert the values into strings and then concatenate them together with a space in between using the `join` method. \n\nFinally, we test out our code with an example by creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` (`f`) with the value 1.8 and the unit \"meters\", and then printing the result of calling `show(f)`.","status":200,"tokens":[76,282],"elapsed":7.340884958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
