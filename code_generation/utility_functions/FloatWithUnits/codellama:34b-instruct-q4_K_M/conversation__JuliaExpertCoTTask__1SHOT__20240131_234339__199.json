The `string` function is used to concatenate the two strings.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the `value` field of the struct is a floating-point number, and the `unit` field is a string representing the unit of measurement (e.g., \"meters\"). If your struct has different types for these fields, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,198],"elapsed":5.536102058,"_type":"aimessage"}]
