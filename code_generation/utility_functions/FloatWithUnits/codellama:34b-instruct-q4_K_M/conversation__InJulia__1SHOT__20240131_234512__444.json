The `show` method is then defined to print the value and unit separated by a space.\n\nYou can test this by creating an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct and calling the `show` method on it:\n```\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(1.8 meters)\n\njulia> show(fwu)\n1.8 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,229],"elapsed":6.331420896,"_type":"aimessage"}]
