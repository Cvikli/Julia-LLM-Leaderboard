For example, if you have a variable `x` of type `FloatWithUnits`, you can call `show(x)` to print it to the console as \"1.8 meters\".\n\nAlternatively, you could define the `show` method as a string interpolation, like this:\n```\nfunction show(io::IO, x::FloatWithUnits)\n    println(io, \"$(x.value) $(x.unit)\")\nend\n```\nThis will also print the value and unit with a space between them, but it uses string interpolation to build the output string rather than concatenating strings directly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,253],"elapsed":7.003319589,"_type":"aimessage"}]
