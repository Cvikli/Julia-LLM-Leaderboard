The `%%.1f` part formats the floating-point number to 1 decimal place, and the `\\n` at the end of the `printf` statement inserts a newline character to create proper formatting.\n\nNow you can use this method whenever you want to print an instance of the `FloatWithUnits` struct with its value and unit separated by a space:\n```javascript\njulia> fwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nFloatWithUnits(value=1.8, unit=\" meters \")\n\njulia> show(fwu)\nShow FloatWithUnits struct\n1.80 meters \n```","status":200,"tokens":[81,357],"elapsed":6.315139458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
