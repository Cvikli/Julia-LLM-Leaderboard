The custom `Show.float_with_units` method is then defined to concatenate these values using the provided format string: \"%.2f %s\". This method will be used to display instances of `FloatWithUnits`.\n\nYou can use this code with your example like this:\n```julia\njulia> my_float = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n8e-3 meters\n\n@my_float: 1.80 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[196,209],"elapsed":6.873983042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
