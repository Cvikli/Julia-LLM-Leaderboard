Then, I write a custom `show` method called `float_with_units` which takes an instance of this struct as input. Inside the method, I use the `format` function to concatenate the value and unit with a space, rounding it to two decimal places using the format specifier `%.2f`. Finally, I return the formatted string.\n\nNow you can create an instance of `FloatWithUnits` and call the `float_with_units` method:\n```julia\nfwo = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(float_with_units(fwo)) // prints \"1.80 meters\"\n```","status":200,"tokens":[196,244],"elapsed":4.784607625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
