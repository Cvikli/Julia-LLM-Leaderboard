The `implode` helper simplifies the string formatting by removing decimal points from the floating-point number. Then, we define the `FloatWithUnits` struct with its fields, and finally create the custom `show` method that uses `format` to concatenate the value and unit with a space.\n\nNow you can test it:\n```julia\n@assert(FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\").show() == \"1.8 meters\")\nrunit\n```","status":200,"tokens":[196,232],"elapsed":7.150434542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
