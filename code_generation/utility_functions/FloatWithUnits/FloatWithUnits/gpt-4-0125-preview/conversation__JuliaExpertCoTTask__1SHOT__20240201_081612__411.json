Execution and representation will be implicitly tested through the Julia REPL or any Julia environment because the `show` method will be called automatically whenever an instance of `FloatWithUnits` is to be printed.\n\n### Step 4: Check the solution\n\nTo verify my solution, I will create an instance as provided in the Data section:\n\n```julia\nobj = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(obj)  # This should print: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nThis will check if the `show` method is correctly concatenating the value and unit with a space, resulting in the desired output.","status":200,"tokens":[174,320],"elapsed":22.950441333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
