Define a struct `FloatWithUnits` that holds a float `value` and a string `unit`.\n2. Write a `show` method for the `FloatWithUnits` struct that will output the value and unit with a space between them, for instance, \"1.8 meters\".\n\n### Step 2: Write any functions and other code you need\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, fu::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, fu.value, \" \", fu.unit)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the task\n\nGiven that the struct and the `show` method are defined, creating an instance of `FloatWithUnits` with a value of `1.8` and a unit of `\"meters\"` and printing it should display `1.8 meters`.\n\n### Step 4: Check that your solution is correct\n\n```julia\n# Create an instance of FloatWithUnits\nfwu = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\n\n# Print the instance\nprintln(fwu) # Should display \"1.8 meters\"\n```\n\nThe expected output for the provided example `FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")` is \"1.8 meters\" when printed.","status":200,"tokens":[174,289],"elapsed":20.915657833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
