Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\n# Define the FloatWithUnits struct\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\n# Implement a custom show method\nfunction Base.show(io::IO, f: FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n\n# Example of usage\nf = FloatWithUnits(1.8, \"meters\")\nprintln(f)  # This will output: 1.8 meters\n```\n\nIn this example, the `FloatWithUnits` struct is defined with two fields: `value` as a `Float64` and `unit` as a `String`. The custom `show` method for this struct uses Julia's polymorphism feature by modifying the behavior of the `Base.show` function. This custom `show` function is defined to specifically handle `FloatWithUnits` instances.\n\nWhen `println(f)` is called where `f` is an instance of `FloatWithUnits`, Julia dispatches to our custom `show` method, which concatenates the `value` and `unit` fields with a space in between, just as you wanted.","status":200,"tokens":[70,271],"elapsed":21.311953584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
