Here's the complete definition:\n\n```julia\nstruct FloatWithUnits\n    value::Float64\n    unit::String\nend\n\nfunction show(io::IO, f::FloatWithUnits)\n    print(io, \"$(f.value) $(f.unit)\")\nend\n```\n\nThis `FloatWithUnits` struct has two fields: `value` of type `Float64` and `unit` of type `String`. The `show` method takes an `IO` object (input/output) as its first argument and the `FloatWithUnits` instance as its second argument. Inside the method, we use the `print` function to concatenate the value, a space, and the unit, and print the result to the output stream.","status":200,"tokens":[72,200],"elapsed":2.129274875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
