Here's an example of how you might define it:\n\n```rust\npub struct FloatWithUnits {\n    value: f64,\n    unit: String,\n}\n\nimpl FloatWithUnits {\n    pub fn new(value: f64, unit: &str) -> Self {\n        FloatWithUnits {\n            value,\n            unit: String::from(unit),\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn value(&self) -> f64 {\n        self.value\n    }\n\n    pub fn unit(&self) -> &String {\n        &self.unit\n    }\n\n    pub fn show(&self) -> String {\n        format!(\"{:.2} {}\\n\", self.value, self.unit)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `show` method uses the `format!` macro to concatenate the value and unit with a space and a newline character for readability. The `{:.2}` format specifier is used to display the value with two decimal places.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the `show` method:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let f = FloatWithUnits::new(1.8, \"meters\");\n    println!(\"{}\", f.show());\n}\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n1.80 meters\n```","status":200,"tokens":[70,342],"elapsed":2.908391625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
