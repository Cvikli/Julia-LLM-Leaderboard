Here's an example of how to define them:\n\n```swift\nstruct FloatWithUnits {\n    let value: Float\n    let unit: String\n\n    init(_ value: Float, _ unit: String) {\n        self.value = value\n        self.unit = unit\n    }\n}\n\nextension FloatWithUnits {\n    func show() -> String {\n        return String(format: \"%.1f %@\", value, unit)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis `FloatWithUnits` struct has a `value` field of type `Float` and a `unit` field of type `String`. The `init` method initializes the struct with a given value and unit. The `show` method is an extension of `FloatWithUnits`, which returns a formatted string consisting of the value with one decimal point and a space followed by the unit. The `%@` format specifier is used for the unit string.","status":200,"tokens":[70,238],"elapsed":2.208264917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
