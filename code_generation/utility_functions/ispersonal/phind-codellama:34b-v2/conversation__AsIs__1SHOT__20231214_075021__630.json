[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"Write a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a function `isPersonal` that meets your requirements:\n```\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom abstractvehicle import AbstractVehicle\n\ndef isPersonal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns true if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving, false otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(vehicle, (Car, Motorcycle)):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Bus):\n        return False\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Truck):\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False  # Default to false for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_car = Car(\"Toyota Camry\")\nprint(isPersonal(my_car))  # Output: True\n\nmy_bus = Bus(\"Coach bus\")\nprint(isPersonal(my_bus))  # Output: False\n\nmy_truck = Truck(\"Ford F-150\")\nprint(isPersonal(my_truck))  # Output: False\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n* The function takes an `AbstractVehicle` object as input.\n* It checks if the provided vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, then it returns `True`.\n* It checks if the provided vehicle is a `Bus`. If it is, then it returns `False`.\n* It checks if the provided vehicle is a `Truck`. If it is, then it returns `False`.\n* If the provided vehicle is none of the above, then it returns `False` by default.\n\nNote that this function only considers vehicles that are typically used for everyday driving to be \"personal\". Vehicles like buses and trucks are generally not used for personal transportation, so they are excluded from the definition of a personal vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[96,436],"elapsed":14.962821709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
