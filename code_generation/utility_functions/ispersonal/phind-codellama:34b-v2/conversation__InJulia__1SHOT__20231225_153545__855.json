It returns `true` if the provided type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` otherwise. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))        # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))         # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))       # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[124,259],"elapsed":34.294739916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
