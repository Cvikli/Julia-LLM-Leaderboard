All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction ispersonal(x::AbstractVehicle)\n    x isa Car || x isa Motorcycle\nend\n\nispersonal(Car()) # true\nispersonal(Motorcycle()) # true\nispersonal(Bus()) # false\nispersonal(Truck()) # false\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle type is either a car or a motorcycle using pattern matching. If it is, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false. The `AbstractVehicle` trait is used as the generic type parameter for the function to make it applicable to any subtype of abstract vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[145,144],"elapsed":6.331449584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
