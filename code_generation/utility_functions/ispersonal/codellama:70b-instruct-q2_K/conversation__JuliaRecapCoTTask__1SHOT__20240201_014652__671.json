[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Define a Vehicle abstract type and its subtypes Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck:\n    ```julia\n    abstract type AbstractVehicle end\n    \n    struct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\n    struct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\n    struct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\n    struct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n    ```\n2. Define a function `ispersonal` that takes an AbstractVehicle argument and returns a Bool:\n    ```julia\n    function ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)::Bool\n        return false # Default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n    end\n    ```\n3. Add methods for each Vehicle type with personal driving traits:\n    ```julia\n    function ispersonal(vehicle::Car)::Bool\n        return true\n    end\n    \n    function ispersonal(vehicle::Motorcycle)::Bool\n        return true\n    end\n    ```\n4. Add methods for Vehicle types with non-personal driving traits:\n    ```julia\n    function ispersonal(vehicle::Bus)::Bool\n        return false\n    end\n    \n    function ispersonal(vehicle::Truck)::Bool\n        return false\n    end\n    ```\n5.
