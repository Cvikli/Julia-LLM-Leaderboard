All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Define your own vehicle types:\n```julia-repl\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Define the function for ispersonal trait. \nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)::Bool\n    if v isa Car || v isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif v isa Bus || v isa Truck\n        return false\n    else # catch-all clause for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n2. Test the function: \n```julia-repl\n# Examples of the usage of your `ispersonal` function for each vehicle type\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))       # should print true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))   # should print true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))       # should print false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))    # should print false\n```\n3. The last step is to define a catch-all clause for all other subtypes of AbstractVehicle that returns the default value `false`. This will make sure that your function handles unknown vehicle types gracefully without throwing an error or returning a wrong result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,312],"elapsed":12.857075694,"_type":"aimessage"}]
