[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Multiple dispatch means that a function can be defined to work with different types of arguments, and we can use this feature to create the `ispersonal` function that works for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nFirstly, let's define an `AbstractVehicle` type and some specific vehicle types:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n```\nThen we can define the `ispersonal` function that uses multiple dispatch to work with different types of arguments. We set it to return true for Car and Motorcycle, and false for other types:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck)\n    return false\nend\n\n# Default to false for other types\nfunction ispersonal(::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n```\nFinally, we can test the function with an example:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))  # should print `true`\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # should print `true`\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))  # should print `false`\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))  # should print `false`\n```","status":200,"tokens":[418,382],"elapsed":17.539023458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
