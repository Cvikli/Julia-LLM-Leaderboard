[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Recall Julia snipppts that will be useful for this task:\n- Define a function\n- Use multiple dispatch based on type of argument\n- Use AbstractVehicle as a base type for all vehicle types\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nimmutable Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if isa(vehicle, Car) || isa(vehicle, Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe `ispersonal` function correctly checks if a given `AbstractVehicle` instance is of type `Car` or `Motorcycle` and returns `true` if it is, otherwise it defaults to `false`. This function will work for the provided vehicle types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nvehicle1 = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(vehicle1)) # true\n\nvehicle2 = Bus()\nprintln(ispersonal(vehicle2)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[411,329],"elapsed":15.349930833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
