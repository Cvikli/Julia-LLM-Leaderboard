The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

It does this by checking if the types of these subtypes are present in the tuple `[Car, Motorcycle]`, and if those types are not also present in the tuples `[Bus, Truck]` or `typeof(veh).{T<:AbstractVehicle}` (which returns a tuple containing all subtypes of `veh`). The function returns true if the condition is met, and false otherwise.","status":200,"tokens":[144,270],"elapsed":11.292067625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
