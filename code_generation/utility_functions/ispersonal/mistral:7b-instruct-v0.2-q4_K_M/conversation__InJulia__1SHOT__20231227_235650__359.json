All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can define the `ispersonal` function as follows:\n\n```julia using AbstractVehicle\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if issubtype(Car, vehicle) || issubtype(Motorcycle, vehicle)\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nfunction test_ispersonal()\n    car = Car()\n    motorcycle = Motorcycle()\n    bus = Bus()\n    truck = Truck()\n\n    @test ispersonal(car) == true\n    @test ispersonal(motorcycle) == true\n    @test ispersonal(bus) == false\n    @test ispersonal(truck) == false\nend\n\n# Call the test function\ntest_ispersonal()\n```\n\nMake sure you have defined `AbstractVehicle`, `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` types in your code before using this function. The provided example demonstrates calling the `ispersonal` function with instances of each vehicle type to check their personal status.","status":200,"tokens":[103,247],"elapsed":10.175051333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
