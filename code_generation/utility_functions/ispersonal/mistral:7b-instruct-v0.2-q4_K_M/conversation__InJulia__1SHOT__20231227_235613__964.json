The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, here's an example of how you could define the `ispersonal` function:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if isa(vehicle, Car) || isa(vehicle, Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, `AbstractVehicle` is defined as an abstract type that serves as a common base type for all vehicle types. `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. The `ispersonal` function takes an argument of type `AbstractVehicle` and uses the `isa` function to check if it's a `Car` or `Motorcycle` instance. If so, it returns `true`, otherwise it defaults to `false`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\nvehicle1 = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(vehicle1)) # true\n\nvehicle2 = Bus()\nprintln(ispersonal(vehicle2)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,293],"elapsed":11.965428292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
