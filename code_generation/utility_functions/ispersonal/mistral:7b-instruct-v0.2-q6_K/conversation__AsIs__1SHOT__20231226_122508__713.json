All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution for the `ispersonal` function in TypeScript:\n\n```typescript\nabstract class AbstractVehicle {\n  // Add any common properties or methods here if needed\n}\n\nclass Car extends AbstractVehicle {}\nclass Motorcycle extends AbstractVehicle {}\nclass Bus extends AbstractVehicle {}\nclass Truck extends AbstractVehicle {}\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle): vehicle is Car | Motorcycle {\n  return (vehicle instanceof Car || vehicle instanceof Motorcycle);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst myCar = new Car();\nconsole.log(ispersonal(myCar)); // true\n\nconst myBus = new Bus();\nconsole.log(ispersonal(myBus)); // false\n```\n\nIn this example, we define the `AbstractVehicle` class as a base class for all vehicles. The `ispersonal` function uses TypeScript's conditional types and instance checking to determine if the given vehicle is a personal vehicle (i.e., a car or motorcycle). If the vehicle is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, then the function returns `true`; otherwise, it defaults to `false`.\n\nThe usage of this function in the example shows that it correctly identifies a `Car` as personal and a `Bus` as not personal.","status":200,"tokens":[100,292],"elapsed":16.105296708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
