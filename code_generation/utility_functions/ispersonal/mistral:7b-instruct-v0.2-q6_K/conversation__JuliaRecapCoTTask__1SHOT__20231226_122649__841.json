[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We define the abstract base type `AbstractVehicle`.\n2. We define subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, namely `Car` and `Motorcycle`.\n3. We write the `ispersonal` function that checks if a given vehicle is a personal one based on its type.\n4. We use the `ifelse` statement to determine whether the vehicle is a car or motorcycle, in which case we return the `:Personal` trait. For all other vehicles (bus and truck), we return the `:NonPersonal` trait.\n5. We test our function with sample instances of Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck to ensure it returns the expected result. If an unknown vehicle type is passed to the function, we raise an error.","status":200,"tokens":[411,426],"elapsed":25.478266959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
