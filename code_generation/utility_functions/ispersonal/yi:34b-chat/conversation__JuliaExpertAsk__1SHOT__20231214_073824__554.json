All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    return false # default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    return true # a car is a personal vehicle for everyday driving\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    return true # a motorcycle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    return false # a bus is not a personal vehicle for everyday driving\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    return false # a truck is not a personal vehicle for everyday driving\nend\n```\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```\nNote that the function only works for types that are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. If you try to call the function with a type that is not a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, it will default to `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[142,324],"elapsed":11.672147,"_type":"aimessage"}]
