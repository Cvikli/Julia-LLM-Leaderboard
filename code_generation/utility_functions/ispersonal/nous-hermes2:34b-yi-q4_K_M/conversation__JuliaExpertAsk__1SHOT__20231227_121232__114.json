All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nThe function `ispersonal` can be implemented as follows:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function uses type dispatch to check if the provided `vehicle` is of a personal type. It returns `true` for both `Car` and `Motorcycle`, while returning `false` for other types such as `Bus` or `Truck`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,163],"elapsed":30.30696525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
