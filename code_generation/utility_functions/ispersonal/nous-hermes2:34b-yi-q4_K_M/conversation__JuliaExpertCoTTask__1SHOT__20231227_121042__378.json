All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define a type hierarchy for AbstractVehicle and its subtypes Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck.\n2. Create the `ispersonal` function that takes an AbstractVehicle as input.\n3.
