All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nimmutable Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Union{Car, Motorcycle})\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(_::Union{Bus,Truck})\n    false\nend\n```\n\nThe above code defines an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `ispersonal` function takes a single argument of type `Union{Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck}`. When called with a `Car` or `Motorcycle` instance, it returns the value `true`. For any other subtype like `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. By using `Union` and defining separate functions for each subtype, we can achieve the required behavior.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(car)) # Output: true\n\nbus = Bus()\nprintln(ispersonal(bus)) # Output: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[144,274],"elapsed":9.116970666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
