All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Think through the approach step by step:\n   - We need to write a function `ispersonal` that checks if a provided vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving or not.\n   - All vehicles are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. So, we will check the type of the provided vehicle and return true for Car and Motorcycle, and false for Bus and Truck.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nimmutable Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    # Check the type of the provided vehicle and return true or false accordingly.\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if isa(vehicle, Car) || isa(vehicle, Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\n\nThe `ispersonal()` function returns the correct result for all given subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[218,374],"elapsed":12.62758275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
