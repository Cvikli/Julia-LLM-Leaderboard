All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, here's an example of how you could define the `ispersonal` function as a helper method for the `AbstractVehicle` type:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nimmutable Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nimmutable Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if eltype(vehicle) <: (Car, Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nWith this implementation, the `ispersonal` function checks the element type (eltype) of the given `AbstractVehicle` instance and returns `true` if it is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, otherwise it defaults to returning `false`. This approach works for any new subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` you might define in the future as well.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nispersonal(car) # true\nispersonal(motorcycle) # true\nispersonal(bus) # false\nispersonal(truck) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[103,294],"elapsed":9.516570083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
