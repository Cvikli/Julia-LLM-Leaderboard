All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If you need to check against an instance, you would slightly modify the function signature to accept instances.","status":200,"tokens":[134,284],"elapsed":10.922561459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
