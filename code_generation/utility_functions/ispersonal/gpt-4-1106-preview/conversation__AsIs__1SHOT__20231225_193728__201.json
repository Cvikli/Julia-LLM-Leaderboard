All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following is an example of a Python function named `ispersonal` that achieves what you've described. The function takes a single argument which is expected to be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns `True` if the vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving (i.e., `Car` or `Motorcycle`), and `False` otherwise, including for any other subtype not explicitly checked.\n\n```python\nclass AbstractVehicle:\n    pass\n\nclass Car(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Motorcycle(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Bus(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Truck(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\n# Other vehicle types not defined would also inherently be subtypes of AbstractVehicle\n\ndef ispersonal(vehicle_type):\n    return vehicle_type in (Car, Motorcycle)\n\n# Example usages\nprint(ispersonal(Car))        # True\nprint(ispersonal(Motorcycle)) # True\nprint(ispersonal(Bus))        # False\nprint(ispersonal(Truck))      # False\n\n# For a new class that is unaccounted for, it should return False as it defaults to False for any other subtype\nclass Bicycle(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nprint(ispersonal(Bicycle))    # False\n```\n\nIf you are using actual type checking, you might want to ensure that `vehicle_type` indeed inherits from `AbstractVehicle`. You could do this by checking `issubclass(vehicle_type, AbstractVehicle)`, given that `vehicle_type` is expected to be a class, not an instance.\n\nLet me know if you need help with including such a check or modifying the code further!","status":200,"tokens":[96,326],"elapsed":16.97592575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
