If this would be a subtype in real use, that case should also be illustrated with an actual subtype rather than a string. In the provided example there is no subtype defined called `Van`, but if that were needed, one would define `struct Van <: AbstractVehicle end` and test it accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[196,367],"elapsed":42.790595291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
