The `ispersonal` function takes an `AbstractVehicle` instance and checks its type, returning `true` if it's a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, `false` if it's a `Bus` or `Truck`, and `false` by default for any other subtype. The provided example tests the function with a `Car` instance.","status":200,"tokens":[196,229],"elapsed":13.72338375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
