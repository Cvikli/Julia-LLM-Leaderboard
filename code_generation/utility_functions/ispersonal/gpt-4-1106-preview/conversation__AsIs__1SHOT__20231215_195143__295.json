Below is a Python function `is_personal` that checks if the provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. The function assumes that `Car` and `Motorcycle` are considered personal vehicles, while `Bus` and `Truck` are not. Any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` will default to `false`.\n\n```python\nclass AbstractVehicle:\n    pass\n\nclass Car(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Motorcycle(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Bus(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Truck(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\n# Other subtypes of AbstractVehicle can be defined here\n# class OtherVehicleType(AbstractVehicle):\n#     pass\n\ndef is_personal(vehicle_type):\n    if not issubclass(vehicle_type, AbstractVehicle):\n        raise ValueError(\"Provided type is not a subtype of AbstractVehicle\")\n    \n    personal_vehicles = (Car, Motorcycle)\n    return vehicle_type in personal_vehicles\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_personal(Car))        # Should return True\nprint(is_personal(Motorcycle)) # Should return True\nprint(is_personal(Bus))        # Should return False\nprint(is_personal(Truck))      # Should return False\n\n# If you define another subtype, it should return False by default\n# print(is_personal(OtherVehicleType)) # Should return False\n```\n\nThis function uses a tuple `personal_vehicles` to store the types that are considered personal vehicles. It then checks if the provided `vehicle_type` is in that tuple. If the `vehicle_type` is not a subclass of `AbstractVehicle`, the function raises a `ValueError`.","status":200,"tokens":[96,329],"elapsed":21.861516583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
