All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a function `isPersonal` that returns a boolean value indicating whether a given Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving:\n```\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass AbstractVehicle(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def getType(): pass\n\nclass Car(AbstractVehicle):\n    def getType():\n        return \"Car\"\n\nclass Motorcycle(AbstractVehicle):\n    def getType():\n        return \"Motorcycle\"\n\nclass Bus(AbstractVehicle):\n    def getType():\n        return \"Bus\"\n\nclass Truck(AbstractVehicle):\n    def getType():\n        return \"Truck\"\n\ndef isPersonal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle) -> bool:\n    if vehicle.getType() in (\"Car\", \"Motorcycle\"):\n        return True\n    elif vehicle.getType() in (\"Bus\", \"Truck\"):\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage:\ncar = Car()\nprint(isPersonal(car)) # Output: True\n\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nprint(isPersonal(motorcycle)) # Output: True\n\nbus = Bus()\nprint(isPersonal(bus)) # Output: False\n\ntruck = Truck()\nprint(isPersonal(truck)) # Output: False\n```\nIn this code, the `AbstractVehicle` class is an abstract base class that all vehicles will inherit from. The `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` classes are all subclasses of `AbstractVehicle`, each with their own `getType()` method that returns a string representing the vehicle type.\n\nThe `isPersonal` function takes a `vehicle` parameter of type `AbstractVehicle`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. The function first checks if the vehicle's type is either \"Car\" or \"Motorcycle\", in which case it returns `True`. If the vehicle's type is either \"Bus\" or \"Truck\", it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `False` by default.\n\nIn the example usage, we create instances of each type of vehicle and pass them to the `isPersonal()` function to verify whether they are personal vehicles for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[96,543],"elapsed":18.84228275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
