All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false .

Here is a function `isPersonal` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving:\n```\nimport types\n\ndef isPersonal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle) -> bool:\n    if isinstance(vehicle, (Car, Motorcycle)):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, (Bus, Truck)):\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False\n```\nIn this function, we use the `isinstance()` function to check the type of the `vehicle` argument. If the vehicle is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, we return `True` since these are personal vehicles for everyday driving. If the vehicle is a `Bus` or `Truck`, we return `False` since these are typically not used for personal transportation.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\nvehicle = Car()\nprint(isPersonal(vehicle)) # Output: True\n\nvehicle = Bus()\nprint(isPersonal(vehicle)) # Output: False\n```\nNote that the function will default to `False` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[96,289],"elapsed":9.826125083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
