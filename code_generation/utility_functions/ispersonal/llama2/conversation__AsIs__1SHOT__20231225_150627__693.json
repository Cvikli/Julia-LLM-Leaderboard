[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"Write a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `isPersonal` function:\n```\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom abstract_vehicle import AbstractVehicle\n\ndef ispersonal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns true if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving, false otherwise.\n\n    :param vehicle: The vehicle to check\n    :return: True if the vehicle is a personal vehicle, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(vehicle, Car) or isinstance(vehicle, Motorcycle):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Bus):\n        return False\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Truck):\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False  # default to false for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\n```\nHere's an example usage of the `ispersonal` function:\n```\nvehicle = Car()\nprint(ispersonal(vehicle)) # prints True\n\nvehicle = Motorcycle()\nprint(ispersonal(vehicle)) # prints True\n\nvehicle = Bus()\nprint(ispersonal(vehicle)) # prints False\n\nvehicle = Truck()\nprint(ispersonal(vehicle)) # prints False\n\n# other subtypes of AbstractVehicle will default to False\nPrintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle())) # prints False\n```\nI hope this helps!
