When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! I'm glad you provided the task and data. Here's my solution:\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    # Check if vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    return vehicle.type === \"Car\" || vehicle.type === \"Motorcycle\"\nend\n\n# Example\nispersonal(Car()) # Returns true\nispersonal(Bus()) # Returns false\nispersonal(Truck()) # Returns false\n\nExplanation:\nThe `ispersonal` function takes an `AbstractVehicle` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. We are checking if the vehicle's type is either \"Car\" or \"Motorcycle\", which are considered personal vehicles, or any other type, which is not.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[235,207],"elapsed":13.308821166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
