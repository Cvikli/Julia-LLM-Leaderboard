All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```julia\nmodule AbstractVehicle\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Vehicle})\n    # default to false\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    # a car is a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    # a motorcycle is also a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    # a bus is not a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    # a truck is also not a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    return false\nend\n```\nHere's an example of how to use the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\n# assume we have a variable `v` with type Vehicle\nif ispersonal(v)\n    # v is a personal vehicle, do something\nelse\n    # v is not a personal vehicle, do something else\nend\n```\nI hope this helps!
