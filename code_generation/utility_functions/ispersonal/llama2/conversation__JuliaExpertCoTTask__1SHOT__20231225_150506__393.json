All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Thank you for providing the task and data. Here is my solution:\n\nFunction `ispersonal`:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    # Check if the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    return vehicle.type in [\"Car\", \"Motorcycle\"]\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes an `AbstractVehicle` object as input.\n* We check if the vehicle's `type` is either `\"Car\"` or `\"Motorcycle\"`. If it is, then the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving and the function returns `true`.\n* If the vehicle's `type` is not in the list of personal vehicles, then the function returns `false`.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car()) # Returns true\nispersonal(Motorcycle()) # Returns true\nispersonal(Bus()) # Returns false\nispersonal(Truck()) # Returns false\n```\nNote that the function only checks the `type` property of the `AbstractVehicle` object and does not consider other factors such as size, weight, or intended use.","status":200,"tokens":[1,266],"elapsed":8.818903459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
