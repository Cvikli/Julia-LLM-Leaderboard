All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` to represent the supertype of all vehicles.\n2. We define four concrete types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` that are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. We define a function `ispersonal` that takes a type parameter `T` and returns a trait indicating whether the vehicle is personal or not. The default implementation for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is to return `false`.\n4. We specialize the implementation of `ispersonal` for the concrete types `Car` and `Motorcycle` to return `true`, since they are personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":9.89815488,"_type":"aimessage"}]
