All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n```\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `ispersonal` function is defined for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n* It returns `false` by default, but special cases are defined for the `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Bus` types.\n* The `Truck` type is not included in the special cases, so it will return `false` by default.\n\nExample usage:\n```\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,279],"elapsed":7.812076363,"_type":"aimessage"}]
