All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n# Data:\n\nispersonal(Car())\n\n# Solution:\n\nHere is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia, following the given Task and using the provided Data:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\n```\nIn this implementation, we define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types that are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We also define a function `ispersonal` that takes an instance of `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns a trait indicating whether the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.\n\nThe function `ispersonal` is defined using multiple dispatch, with separate methods for each subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The default method returns false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. For the specific types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`, we define the corresponding methods that return true if the vehicle is a personal vehicle, and false otherwise.\n\nWe can test the function by calling it with an instance of each type:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car()) # returns true\nispersonal(Motorcycle()) # returns true\nispersonal(Bus()) # returns false\nispersonal(Truck()) # returns false\n```\nAs expected, the function returns true for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and false for `Bus` and `Truck`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,532],"elapsed":15.155629913,"_type":"aimessage"}]
