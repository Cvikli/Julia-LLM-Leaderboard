We define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` that represents the supertype of all vehicle types.\n2. We define four concrete subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Each of these subtypes is a leaf node in the type hierarchy, meaning that they have no subtypes themselves.\n3. We define a function `ispersonal` that takes an argument of type `AbstractVehicle`. This function returns `false` by default for any input vehicle type that is not explicitly handled by one of the following two cases.\n4. We handle the case where the input vehicle is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, which are both considered personal vehicles. In this case, we return `true`.\n5. For all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, we return `false`. This includes `Bus` and `Truck`, which are not personal vehicles.\n6. We provide an example usage of the function by calling it with a `Car()` argument, which should return `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,346],"elapsed":9.799394527,"_type":"aimessage"}]
