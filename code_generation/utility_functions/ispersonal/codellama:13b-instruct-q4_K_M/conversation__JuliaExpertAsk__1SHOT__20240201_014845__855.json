All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    vehicle_type = typeof(vehicle)\n    return vehicle_type <: Car || vehicle_type <: Motorcycle ? true : false\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `<:` operator to check if the type of `vehicle` is a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, then `true` is returned. Otherwise, `false` is returned.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus)) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck)) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,217],"elapsed":3.034672553,"_type":"aimessage"}]
