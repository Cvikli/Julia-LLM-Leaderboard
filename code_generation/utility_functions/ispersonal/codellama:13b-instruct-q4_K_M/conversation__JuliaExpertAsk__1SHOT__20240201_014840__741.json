All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    return v isa Union{Car,Motorcycle}\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `isa` function to check if the provided argument is a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, then the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. The default behavior for any other type that is not a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` is also set to return `false`.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nv = Car()\nispersonal(v)  # returns true\n\nv = Bus()\nispersonal(v)  # returns false\n\nv = Truck()\nispersonal(v)  # returns false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,247],"elapsed":3.458831176,"_type":"aimessage"}]
