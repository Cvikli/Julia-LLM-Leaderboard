[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We then define the function `ispersonal` with multiple dispatch. The first two functions return true for personal vehicles (`Car` and `Motorcycle`), while the latter two functions return false by using pattern matching on the type of vehicle passed in (`Bus` and `Truck`).\n\nTo test this function, we can write:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(\"Car: $(ispersonal(car))\") # true\nprintln(\"Motorcycle: $(ispersonal(motorcycle))\") # true\nprintln(\"Bus: $(ispersonal(bus))\") # false\nprintln(\"Truck: $(ispersonal(truck))\") # false\n```\nThis function will return `true` for a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and `false` for a `Bus` or a `Truck`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,383],"elapsed":5.335855283,"_type":"aimessage"}]
