The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We override this behavior for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types by returning true respectively. Since `Bus` and `Truck` are not included in our definitions, they will return false as well.\n \nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[226,278],"elapsed":50.682293333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
