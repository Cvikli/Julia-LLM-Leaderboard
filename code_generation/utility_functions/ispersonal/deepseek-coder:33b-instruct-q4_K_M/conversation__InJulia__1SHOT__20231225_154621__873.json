The `ispersonal` function could be implemented using this concept:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type) = false  # default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n```\n\nThis defines a set of vehicle types, where `Car` and `Motorcycle` are personal vehicles (returning `true`), and all others (including `Bus` and `Truck`) are not personal vehicles (returning `false`). The default case is used for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nWe can now use this function like so:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # Outputs true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # Outputs true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # Outputs false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # Outputs false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle))  # Outputs false, as it's not a subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n```","status":200,"tokens":[111,323],"elapsed":54.326860625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
