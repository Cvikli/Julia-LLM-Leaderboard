Then, we create the classes `Car` and `Motorcycle` which inherit from `AbstractVehicle` but override the `ispersonal()` method to return True since they are considered personal vehicles. For classes `Bus` and `Truck`, as they do not redefine `ispersonal()`, they will use the default behavior from their parent class `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[108,388],"elapsed":64.933343959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
