All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, we need to define our AbstractVehicle, Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck types. I'm going to use the built-in `AbstractType` from Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n```\n\nNow, we can write our `ispersonal` function. This function will accept an instance of a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and return true for Car and Motorcycle types, false for Bus and Truck types. For all other types it will default to returning false:\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<: AbstractVehicle}\n    if T <: Union{Car, Motorcycle}\n        return true\n    elseif T <: Union{Bus, Truck}\n        return false\n    else \n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nAnd finally, let's test our function on an example. Let's say we have a Car:\n\n```julia\nmycar = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(mycar)) # should print true\n```","status":200,"tokens":[152,288],"elapsed":49.6021995,"_type":"aimessage"}]
