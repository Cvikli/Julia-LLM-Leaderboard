All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Here is a simple example that might help:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Type{Car}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle}) = true\nispersonal(::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = false  # Default case for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n\n# Example usage:\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))            # Should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))            # Should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))     # Should return true\n```\n\nIn this code, `AbstractVehicle` is an abstract type and `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus` and `Truck` are subtypes of it. The function `ispersonal` checks the type of the vehicle to decide whether it's a personal vehicle or not. It returns true for `Car` and `Motorcycle` (subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`), and false for any other types that extend `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[111,294],"elapsed":49.600732583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
