All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution for your problem:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Union{Car,Motorcycle}\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Union{Bus,Truck}\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `ispersonal` function checks the type of the given vehicle. If it's a Car or Motorcycle, it returns true; if it's a Bus or Truck, it returns false; and for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it also defaults to false. \n\nFor example:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # prints: true\n```\nThis code creates an instance of Car, passes it to `ispersonal` function and checks if it's a personal vehicle or not. As the given vehicle is a Car which is a personal vehicle for everyday driving, the output is true. \n\nNote that I defined the types `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck` as subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. This means they all belong to AbstractVehicle's type tree which makes it possible for us to write a single function that works with any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[226,347],"elapsed":85.493527084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
