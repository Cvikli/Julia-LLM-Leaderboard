All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

I will use pattern matching to check the type of the vehicle and return `true` if it is a Car or Motorcycle, and `false` if it is a Bus or Truck. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, the function will default to `false`.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\nispersonal(Car())  # should return true\n```\n\nThe expected output is `true`, as a Car is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[196,213],"elapsed":4.639973792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
