All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We will define separate methods for each vehicle type and return the appropriate boolean value based on the vehicle type.\n\nHere's the code to solve the task:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where T<:AbstractVehicle\n    false\nend\n\ncar = Car()\nispersonal(typeof(car))\n```\n\nOutput:\n```julia\ntrue\n```\n\nThe function `ispersonal` correctly returns `true` for `Car` type, which is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[196,235],"elapsed":3.671332416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
