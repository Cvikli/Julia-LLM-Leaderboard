All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Check if the type of `v` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If yes, return true.\n3. Check if the type of `v` is either `Bus` or `Truck`. If yes, return false.\n4.
