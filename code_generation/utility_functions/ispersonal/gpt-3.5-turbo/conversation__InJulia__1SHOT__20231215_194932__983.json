All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    if vehicle == Car || vehicle == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle == Bus || vehicle == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can test the function with different vehicle types:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # false\nprintln(ispersonal(AbstractVehicle))  # false\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ispersonal` function takes a type as an argument and checks if it matches any of the specific vehicle types. If it matches Car or Motorcycle, it returns true. If it matches Bus or Truck, it returns false. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, it also returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[99,238],"elapsed":4.894690292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
