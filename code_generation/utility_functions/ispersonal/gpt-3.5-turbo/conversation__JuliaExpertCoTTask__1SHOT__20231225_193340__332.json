All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

We can use pattern matching to check if the argument is an instance of either Car or Motorcycle, and return true for these types. For all other types of vehicles, including Bus and Truck, we can return false. \n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test the function with an example:\n\n```julia\nispersonal(Car())\n```\n\nThe output should be `true` since `Car()` is a personal vehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[196,184],"elapsed":2.943828667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
