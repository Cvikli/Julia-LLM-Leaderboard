All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of the `ispersonal` function implemented in Python:\n\n```python\nclass AbstractVehicle:\n    pass\n\nclass Car(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Motorcycle(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Bus(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Truck(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\ndef ispersonal(vehicle):\n    if isinstance(vehicle, Car) or isinstance(vehicle, Motorcycle):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Bus) or isinstance(vehicle, Truck):\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nvehicle1 = Car()\nvehicle2 = Motorcycle()\nvehicle3 = Bus()\nvehicle4 = Truck()\n\nprint(ispersonal(vehicle1))  # True\nprint(ispersonal(vehicle2))  # True\nprint(ispersonal(vehicle3))  # False\nprint(ispersonal(vehicle4))  # False\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle is an instance of Car or Motorcycle, and returns `True` in those cases. It also checks if the vehicle is an instance of Bus or Truck, and returns `False` for those cases. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, the function defaults to `False`.\n\nThe example usage then demonstrates how the function works by creating instances of different vehicles and passing them to the `ispersonal` function, printing the result for each case.","status":200,"tokens":[96,272],"elapsed":4.092736542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
