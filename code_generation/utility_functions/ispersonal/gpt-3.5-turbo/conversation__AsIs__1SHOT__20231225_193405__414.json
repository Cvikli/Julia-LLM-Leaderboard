All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Python:\n\n```python\nclass AbstractVehicle:\n    pass\n\nclass Car(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Motorcycle(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Bus(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\nclass Truck(AbstractVehicle):\n    pass\n\ndef ispersonal(vehicle):\n    if isinstance(vehicle, Car) or isinstance(vehicle, Motorcycle):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Bus) or isinstance(vehicle, Truck):\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\ncar = Car()\nprint(ispersonal(car))  # Output: True\n\nbus = Bus()\nprint(ispersonal(bus))  # Output: False\n\nbike = Motorcycle()\nprint(ispersonal(bike))  # Output: True\n\ntruck = Truck()\nprint(ispersonal(truck))  # Output: False\n```\n\nIn this example, we have defined the `ispersonal` function that takes a `vehicle` parameter. The function uses the `isinstance` function to check if the provided vehicle is an instance of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns True. If the vehicle is an instance of `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns False. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function also returns False.\n\nWe then provide an example usage of this function with different vehicles and print out the results.","status":200,"tokens":[96,279],"elapsed":4.6562205,"_type":"aimessage"}]
