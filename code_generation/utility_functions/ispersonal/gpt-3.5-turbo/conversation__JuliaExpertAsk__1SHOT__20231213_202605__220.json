All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

If it is, then it returns `true`, indicating a personal vehicle. Otherwise, it returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,180],"elapsed":4.025156959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
