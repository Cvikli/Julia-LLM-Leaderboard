All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(vehicle::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}) = vehicle <: Car || vehicle <: Motorcycle\n\n# Examples\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))          # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))   # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))          # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))        # false\n```\nIn this code, we define four subtypes (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`) that inherit from the abstract type `AbstractVehicle`. The `ispersonal` function takes a type argument (`vehicle::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}`) and checks if it is a subtype of either `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\n\nIn the provided examples, `Car` and `Motorcycle` return `true` since they are personal vehicles, while `Bus` and `Truck` return `false` as they are not considered personal vehicles.","status":200,"tokens":[99,252],"elapsed":6.473933917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
