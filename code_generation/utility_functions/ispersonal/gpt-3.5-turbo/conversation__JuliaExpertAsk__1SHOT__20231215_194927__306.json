The function `ispersonal` takes a type argument `vehicle` and checks if it is equal to `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. We provide an example usage of the function with different vehicle types.","status":200,"tokens":[134,223],"elapsed":4.670343417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
