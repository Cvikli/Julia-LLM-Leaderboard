All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can write the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bicycle <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return false\nend\n\n# Example usage\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\nbicycle = Bicycle()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(car))          # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(motorcycle))   # Output: true\nprintln(ispersonal(bus))          # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(truck))        # Output: false\nprintln(ispersonal(bicycle))      # Output: false\n```\n\nIn this example, we define the abstract type `AbstractVehicle`, and then create four subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. We also introduce a new subtype `Bicycle`, which is not considered as a personal vehicle for our purpose.\n\nWe then define the `ispersonal` function using multiple dispatch. The function takes in an argument of type `AbstractVehicle` and checks its specific type using method overloading. If the type matches `Car` or `Motorcycle`, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it defaults to `false`. The example usage demonstrates calling the `ispersonal` function with different vehicle types and outputs the expected results.","status":200,"tokens":[99,330],"elapsed":5.509746208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
