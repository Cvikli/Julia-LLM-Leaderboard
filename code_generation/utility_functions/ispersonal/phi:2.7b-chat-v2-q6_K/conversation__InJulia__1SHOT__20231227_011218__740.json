The Agricultural Scientist has five unique machines - Tractor, Harvester, Sprayer, Weeder and Plow.\n\nThe Agricultural scientist has made some observations:\n1. All the machines have either a Car or Motorcycle type (as these are personal vehicles) but not both.\n2. Tractor is of type 'Car'.\n3. Harvester is not of type 'Motorcycle' and neither it's of type 'Car'. \n4. Sprayer and Weeder are of the same type.\n5. Plow has a different type to all other machines.\n\nQuestion: What type does each machine have?\n\n\nFrom observation 2, we know that Tractor is of type 'Car'. From observation 3, Harvester cannot be of type 'Car' and since it also can't be of type 'Motorcycle', by elimination it must be of type 'Bus'. \n\nSince Sprayer and Weeder have the same type (observation 4), they both can't be of type 'Bus'. By observation 5, Plow has a different type than all other machines. So, it cannot be of type 'Car' or 'Bus'. Since Car is already taken by Tractor, and Bus is taken by Harvester, the only option left for Plow is 'Truck'.\n\nFrom step 2 we know that Plow is of type 'Truck', so Sprayer and Weeder must be of type 'Car' because it's the remaining type.\n\nAnswer: Tractor (Car), Harvester (Bus), Sprayer (Car), Weeder (Car), Plow (Truck).","status":200,"tokens":[100,560],"elapsed":14.865214083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
