All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's an implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef ispersonal(vehicle_type):\n    if vehicle_type == \"Car\" or vehicle_type == \"Motorcycle\":\n        return True\n    elif vehicle_type == \"Bus\" or vehicle_type == \"Truck\":\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```python\n>>> ispersonal(\"Car\")\nTrue\n>>> ispersonal(\"Motorcycle\")\nTrue\n>>> ispersonal(\"Bus\")\nFalse\n>>> ispersonal(\"Truck\")\nFalse\n>>> ispersonal(\"AbstractVehicle\")\nFalse\n``` \n\nIn the example, we first check if the `vehicle_type` is \"Car\" or \"Motorcycle\". Since both of these are personal vehicles for everyday driving, the function returns True. We then check if the `vehicle_type` is \"Bus\" or \"Truck\", which are not personal vehicles for everyday driving and so the function returns False. Finally, we check if the `vehicle_type` is \"AbstractVehicle\", which is a generic vehicle type and so the function defaults to returning False.","status":200,"tokens":[97,296],"elapsed":7.752873625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
