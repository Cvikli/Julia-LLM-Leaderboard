All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is a simple implementation in Julia.\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nabstract type Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::Bus) = false\nispersonal(::Truck) = false\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false\n```\nNow you can use the function: \n\n`julia> ispersonal(Car())`\n\nThis will return `true`. Similarly, for Motorcycles and Trucks it returns `false`. If the input argument is not one of these types, it returns `false` as specified in the default case.","status":200,"tokens":[227,197],"elapsed":11.252242375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
