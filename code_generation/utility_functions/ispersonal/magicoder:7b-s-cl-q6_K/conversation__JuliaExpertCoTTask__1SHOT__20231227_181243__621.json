We first create an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` which is then extended by the concrete types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus and Truck. The function `ispersonal` checks whether the input vehicle belongs to any of these two groups (personal or non-personal) using the `typeof` function in Julia which returns the type of an object at runtime. If it does not match with either types, we return false by default. \n\nWe then call our function on a Car and observe that it correctly returns true as per its subtype.","status":200,"tokens":[227,311],"elapsed":17.094656917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
