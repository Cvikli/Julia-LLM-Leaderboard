All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia. We'll create an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` and four concrete types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Each of these types has a method to determine if they are personal or not.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle)\n    return true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck)\n    return false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{T}) where {T <: AbstractVehicle}\n    return false\nend\n```\n\nThe last function `ispersonal(::Type{T})` serves as a default case. It returns `false` if the type of the provided vehicle doesn't match any of the concrete types. This handles all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nHere is an example usage:\n```julia\njulia> Car() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Motorcycle() |> ispersonal\ntrue\n\njulia> Bus() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n\njulia> Truck() |> ispersonal\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[152,350],"elapsed":18.488726958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
