All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return typeof(vehicle) in (Car, Motorcycle) ? true : false\nend\n```\n\n# Explanation\n\nThe function `ispersonal` takes a single argument of type `AbstractVehicle`, which is an abstract type that represents any vehicle. The function then checks if the provided vehicle is a subtype of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise.\n\nThe default return value is set to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. This ensures that the function works correctly for any other vehicle type that may be added in the future.\n\n# Example Usage\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nispersonal(car) # returns true\n\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nispersonal(motorcycle) # returns true\n\nbus = Bus()\nispersonal(bus) # returns false\n\ntruck = Truck()\nispersonal(truck) # returns false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[235,299],"elapsed":27.710856125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
