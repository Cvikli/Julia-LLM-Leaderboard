The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of a function that returns true if the provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving, and false otherwise:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle\n    # ...\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this example, the `ispersonal` function takes a single argument of type `AbstractVehicle`, which can be any subtype of that abstract type. The function then checks whether the provided vehicle is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle`. If it is, the function returns true. Otherwise, if it is an instance of `Bus` or `Truck`, the function returns false. Finally, if the vehicle is not any of these types, the function returns false by default.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nvehicle = Car()\nispersonal(vehicle) # returns true\n\nvehicle = Bus()\nispersonal(vehicle) # returns false\n\nvehicle = Truck()\nispersonal(vehicle) # returns false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[121,351],"elapsed":19.570392083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
