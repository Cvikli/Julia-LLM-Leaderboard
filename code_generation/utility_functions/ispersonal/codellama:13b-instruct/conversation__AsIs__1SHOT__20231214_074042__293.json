[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"Write a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a function `isPersonal` that returns a boolean indicating whether a given Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving:\n```\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom .abstract_vehicle import AbstractVehicle\n\ndef isPersonal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving, False otherwise.\n\n    :param vehicle: The vehicle to check\n    :return: True if personal, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"{\n        # Car and Motorcycle are personal vehicles, Bus and Truck are not\n        return vehicle.subtype in {'Car', 'Motorcycle'}\n    }\n```\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\n# A car is a personal vehicle\nprint(isPersonal(Car('Toyota Corolla'))) # -> True\n\n# A bus is not a personal vehicle\nprint(isPersonal(Bus('City Bus'))) # -> False\n\n# A motorcycle is a personal vehicle\nprint(isPersonal(Motorcycle('Harley Davidson'))) # -> True\n\n# A truck is not a personal vehicle\nprint(isPersonal(Truck('Peterbilt'))) # -> False\n```\nIn this example, the function `isPersonal` is called with different types of vehicles as arguments. For a `Car`, it returns `True` because it is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. For a `Bus`, it returns `False` because it is not designed for personal use. Similarly, for a `Motorcycle`, it returns `True` because it is a smaller, more agile vehicle suitable for personal use, while for a `Truck`, it returns `False` because it is larger and less maneuverable than a car or motorcycle.\n\nNote that this function only considers the vehicle's type as determined by its subtype in the `AbstractVehicle` class. It does not take into account other factors such as the vehicle's size, seating capacity, or intended use.","status":200,"tokens":[96,466],"elapsed":16.053906334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
