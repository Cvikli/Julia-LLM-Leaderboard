All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia code that defines a function `ispersonal` as requested by you:\n```Julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    if v isa Union{Car, Motorcycle}\n        return true\n    elseif v isa Union{Bus, Truck}\n        return false\n    else\n        # default to false for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function `ispersonal` takes an argument `v` which is an instance of a concrete type that is a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. If the provided type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, it returns `true`. If the provided type is either `Bus` or `Truck`, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it defaults to returning `false` for any other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nHere's an example:\n```Julia\n# This will return true because Car is a personal vehicle\nispersonal(Car())\n\n# This will return false because Bus is not a personal vehicle\nispersonal(Bus())\n\n# This will also return false by default for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\nstruct OtherVehicle <: AbstractVehicle end\nispersonal(OtherVehicle())\n```\n\nLet me know if this helps! ðŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,360],"elapsed":19.381451617,"_type":"aimessage"}]
