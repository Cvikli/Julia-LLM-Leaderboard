All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"The following is a Julia code snippet which defines a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T == Car || T == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif T == Bus || T == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nThe `where` clause specifies that the function is defined for any type `T` as long as it's a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. The `if`, `elseif` and `else` clauses provide specific returns for different types of vehicles. If the vehicle type is not among those specified, it defaults to `false`.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car()))     # Outputs \"true\"\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle()))  # Outputs \"true\"\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus()))    # Outputs \"false\"\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck()))   # Outputs \"false\"\n```\nIn the first two cases, `Car` and `Motorcycle` are among those specified in the function definition as personal vehicles. For the last two examples, `Bus` and `Truck`, they return false since they're not personal vehicles. If a different type of vehicle is provided, e.g., `CargoShip()`, the default value for all other subtypes of `AbstractVehicle` returns `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":21.999695023,"_type":"aimessage"}]
