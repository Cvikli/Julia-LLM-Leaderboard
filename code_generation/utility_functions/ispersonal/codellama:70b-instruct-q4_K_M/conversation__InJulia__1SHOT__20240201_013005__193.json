All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a working code snippet in Julia that defines `ispersonal` function:\n```Julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Car) return true end\nfunction ispersonal(::Motorcycle) return true end\nfunction ispersonal(::Bus) return false end\nfunction ispersonal(::Truck) return false end\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle) return false end\n```\nThe code uses Julia's multiple dispatch feature to define the `ispersonal` function for specific types. The first four lines declare an abstract type, `AbstractVehicle`, and three concrete subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Each of these subtypes is a concrete subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nThe next four functions are methods for the `ispersonal` function. These methods dispatch on the type provided as an argument. The first two methods return `true` when passed a value of type `Car` or `Motorcycle`, while the latter two return `false` when passed a value of type `Bus` or `Truck`. The last method defines the default behavior: it returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n\nNow we can test our function by calling it with instances of each of these types. For example, try this in the REPL (the Julia command-line interface):\n```Julia\njulia> c = Car()\nCar()\njulia> m = Motorcycle()\nMotorcycle()\njulia> b = Bus()\nBus()\njulia> t = Truck()\nTruck()\njulia> ispersonal(c) # This should return true since it's a Car.\ntrue\njulia> ispersonal(m) # Should also return true for Motorcycle.\ntrue\njulia> ispersonal(b) # Should return false since it's a Bus.\nfalse\njulia> ispersonal(t) # Returns false for Truck.\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[121,510],"elapsed":27.992702098,"_type":"aimessage"}]
