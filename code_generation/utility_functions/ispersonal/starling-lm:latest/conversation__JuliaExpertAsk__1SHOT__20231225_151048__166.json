All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here's the function `ispersonal` in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\ntype Car <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\ntype Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Type)\n    if vehicle == Car || vehicle == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we define the `ispersonal` function that takes a `Type` as an argument. It checks if the provided type is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`. If it is, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false. The function defaults to false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. Here's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(ispersonal(typeof(car))) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(typeof(motorcycle))) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(typeof(bus))) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(typeof(truck))) # false\n```\n\nIn this example, we create instances of `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Then, we use the `ispersonal` function to check if they are personal vehicles. The expected outputs are as follows: true for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, false for `Bus` and `Truck`.","status":200,"tokens":[153,353],"elapsed":11.325067625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
