The function then checks if the provided Vehicle type is either a Car or a Motorcycle and returns true in that case. For all other subtypes of AbstractVehicle, it defaults to returning false.\n\nHere's an example of how to use this function:\n\n```julia\nispersonal(Car)  # Returns: true\nispersonal(Motorcycle)  # Returns: true\nispersonal(Bus)  # Returns: false\nispersonal(Truck)  # Returns: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,244],"elapsed":7.855903709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
