All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false .

Here is a possible implementation of the `isPersonal` function:\n```\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom .abstract_vehicle import AbstractVehicle\n\ndef ispersonal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving, False otherwise.\n\n    :param vehicle: The vehicle to check\n    :return: True if personal, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"  # noqa: E501\n\n    if isinstance(vehicle, Car):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Motorcycle):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Bus):\n        return False\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Truck):\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False  # default to False for other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\n```\nHere's an example usage of the `ispersonal` function:\n```\n# Create a vehicle instance\nvehicle = Car()\nprint(ispersonal(vehicle)) # Output: True\n\n# Create a motorcycle instance\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nprint(ispersonal(motorcycle)) # Output: True\n\n# Create a bus instance\nbus = Bus()\nprint(ispersonal(bus)) # Output: False\n\n# Create a truck instance\ntruck = Truck()\nprint(ispersonal(truck)) # Output: False\n```\nIn this implementation, we use type checking to determine whether the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle. We check the type of the `vehicle` parameter using the `isinstance()` function, and return `True` if it's a `Car`, `Motorcycle`, or `Bus`. If it's a `Truck`, we return `False`. If it's any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, we default to returning `False`.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that all personal vehicles are either cars, motorcycles, buses, or trucks. If your use case requires a more nuanced definition of \"personal vehicle\", you may need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[96,489],"elapsed":16.868360334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
