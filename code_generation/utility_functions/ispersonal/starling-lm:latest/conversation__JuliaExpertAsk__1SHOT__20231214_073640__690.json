All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a possible implementation of `ispersonal`:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{V})\n    if V <: Car || V <: Motorcycle\n        true\n    elseif V <: Bus || V <: Truck\n        false\n    else\n        false\n    end\nend\n```\nHere's an example of how you can use `ispersonal`:\n```julia\nV = Type{Car}() # create a new type that is a subtype of AbstractVehicle\nprintln(ispersonal(V)) # prints \"true\"\n\nV = Type{Truck}() # create a new type that is not a personal vehicle\nprintln(ispersonal(V)) # prints \"false\"\n```\nI hope this helps!
