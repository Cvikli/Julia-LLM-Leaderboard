In the provided example, it returns True for Car and Motorcycle, but False for Bus and Truck. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, the function defaults to returning False. Here's an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```python\nmy_car = Car()\nprint(my_car.ispersonal())  # Output: True\n\nmy_bus = Bus()\nprint(my_bus.ispersonal())  # Output: False\n```\n\nIn the above example, `my_car` is an instance of Car, which returns True for `ispersonal()`, and `my_bus` is an instance of Bus, which returns False for `ispersonal()`.","status":200,"tokens":[109,349],"elapsed":11.025668083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
