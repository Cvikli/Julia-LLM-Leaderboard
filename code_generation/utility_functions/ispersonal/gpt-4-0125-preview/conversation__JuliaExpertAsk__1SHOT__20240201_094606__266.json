The `ispersonal` function checks if a given type is a personal vehicle (returning `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`). The usage of `::Type{<:AbstractVehicle}` ensures that the function operates on types rather than instances and provides a way to specify a default behavior for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[134,302],"elapsed":28.119965042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
