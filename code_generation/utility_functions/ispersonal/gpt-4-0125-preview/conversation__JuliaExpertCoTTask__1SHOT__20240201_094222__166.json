Define subtypes for `AbstractVehicle`: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`.\n3. Write the function `ispersonal` that:\n   - Accepts an object of a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`\n   - Returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`\n   - Returns `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` not explicitly defined\n\n4. Test the functionality with an example, following the Task's request by testing with a `Car` type object.\n\n### Step 1: Define abstract type and subtypes\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n```\n\n### Step 2: Write the `ispersonal` function\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if typeof(vehicle) in (Car, Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Task\n\nNow, we will test the function with a `Car` type as per the task's data.\n\n```julia\nresult = ispersonal(Car())\nprintln(\"Is Car a personal vehicle? \", result)\n```\n\n### Expected Output\n\nThe expected output should indicate that a `Car` is indeed considered a personal vehicle.\n\n```\nIs Car a personal vehicle? true\n```","status":200,"tokens":[196,321],"elapsed":24.099919875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
