Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle` to serve as the base type for all vehicle types.\n2. Define the subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`, inheriting from `AbstractVehicle`.\n3. Implement the `ispersonal` function that takes an instance of a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.\n4. Test the function with an example, as requested.\n\nLet's start implementing this step by step:\n\n```julia\n# Step 1: Define the abstract base type\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 2: Define subtypes\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\n# Step 3: Implement the `ispersonal` function\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)::Bool\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Step 4: Example usage\n# Checking if a Car is a personal vehicle\nispersonal(Car())  # Should return true\n```\n\nThis solution defines the necessary types and implements the `ispersonal` function as specified. The example usage demonstrates how to check if a given vehicle, in this case, a `Car`, is considered a personal vehicle for everyday driving. The expected outcome for the example given is `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[196,349],"elapsed":29.434075125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
