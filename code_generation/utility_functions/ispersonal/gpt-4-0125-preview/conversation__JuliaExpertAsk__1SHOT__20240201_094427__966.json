This function uses Julia's multiple dispatch mechanism to determine whether a type is considered a personal vehicle (i.e., `Car` or `Motorcycle`) or not, with a default case that covers all other possibilities and returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[134,255],"elapsed":17.583018333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
