All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Define a function `ispersonal` that takes a single argument `v` which is an instance of any subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n2. Check if the type of `v` is either `Car` or `Motorcycle` using the `isa` function in Julia.\n3. If the type is either `Car` or `Motorcycle`, return `true` indicating that it is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.\n4. Otherwise, return `false`.\n\nHere's the code for the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    if isa(v, Car) || isa(v, Motorcycle)\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\nTo check that the function is working correctly, let's create some examples:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(GenericVehicle()) # where GenericVehicle is a new subtype of AbstractVehicle\nfalse\n```\nAs you can see, the function correctly identifies `Car` and `Motorcycle` as personal vehicles and returns `false` for `Bus`, `Truck`, and any other subtype of AbstractVehicle that is not specified.","status":200,"tokens":[225,411],"elapsed":9.233105167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
