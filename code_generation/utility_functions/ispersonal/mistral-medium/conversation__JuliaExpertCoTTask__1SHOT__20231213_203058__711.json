All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nispersonal(Car())","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is one possible solution:\n\n1. Think through your approach step by step:\n\nWe can create a function `ispersonal` that takes in a vehicle as an argument. We can use a dispatch table to return the appropriate boolean value based on the type of vehicle.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\nWe'll create a dictionary that maps vehicle types to boolean values. The keys of the dictionary will be the subtypes of AbstractVehicle and the values will be true or false depending on whether the vehicle is a personal vehicle or not.\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal_dict = Dict(\n    Car => true,\n    Motorcycle => true,\n    Bus => false,\n    Truck => false\n)\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    return get(ispersonal_dict, typeof(vehicle), false)\nend\n```\n3. Solve the task:\n\nNow we can use the `ispersonal` function to determine whether a vehicle is a personal vehicle or not.\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n```\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nWe can check that our function returns the expected results for the different types of vehicles.\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car()) && ispersonal(Motorcycle()) && !ispersonal(Bus()) && !ispersonal(Truck())\ntrue\n```\n\nNote: If there are other subtypes of AbstractVehicle that are not listed in the dispatch table, the function will return false by default.\n\nExample:\n```julia\njulia> struct Van <: AbstractVehicle end\n\njulia> ispersonal(Van())\nfalse\n```","status":200,"tokens":[225,502],"elapsed":11.349421,"_type":"aimessage"}]
