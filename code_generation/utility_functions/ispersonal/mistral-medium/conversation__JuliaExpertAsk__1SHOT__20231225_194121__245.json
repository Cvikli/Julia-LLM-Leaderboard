All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Two additional methods are defined for the `Car` and `Motorcycle` types to return true.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates that `ispersonal` returns true for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types and false for `Bus` and `Truck` types. Additionally, it shows that attempting to call `ispersonal` on a union type raises a `MethodError`.","status":200,"tokens":[150,411],"elapsed":9.294983458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
