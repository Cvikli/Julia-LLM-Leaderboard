All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Think through your approach step by step:\n\n   - Create a function `ispersonal` that takes a single argument `v` of type `AbstractVehicle`.\n   - Check the type of `v` using Julia's `typeof` function.\n   - If `v` is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, return `true`.\n   - If `v` is a `Bus` or `Truck`, return `false`.\n   - For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, return `false` by default.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    if typeof(v) <: Union{Car, Motorcycle}\n        return true\n    elseif typeof(v) <: Union{Bus, Truck}\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(MyOtherVehicle()) # where MyOtherVehicle is a hypothetical subtype of AbstractVehicle\nfalse\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nThe function `ispersonal` correctly returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` objects, and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck` objects. It also correctly returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[225,461],"elapsed":10.237171834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
