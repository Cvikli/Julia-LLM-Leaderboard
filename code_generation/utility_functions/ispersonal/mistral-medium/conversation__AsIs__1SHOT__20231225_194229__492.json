All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'm an AI language model and I can't directly write code or execute functions. However, I can help you by providing a sample code snippet in a programming language of your choice. Since you didn't specify a language, I'll use Python for this example.\n\n```python\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\nfrom typing import TypeVar, Type, Union\n\n# Define the AbstractVehicle class\nclass AbstractVehicle(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def drive(self):\n        pass\n\n# Define subtypes of AbstractVehicle\nclass Car(AbstractVehicle):\n    def drive(self):\n        print(\"Driving a car\")\n\nclass Motorcycle(AbstractVehicle):\n    def drive(self):\n        print(\"Riding a motorcycle\")\n\nclass Bus(AbstractVehicle):\n    def drive(self):\n        print(\"Driving a bus\")\n\nclass Truck(AbstractVehicle):\n    def drive(self):\n        print(\"Driving a truck\")\n\n# Create a TypeVar for AbstractVehicle subtypes\nVehicleType = TypeVar('VehicleType', bound=AbstractVehicle)\n\n# Define the ispersonal function\ndef ispersonal(vehicle_type: Type[VehicleType]) -> bool:\n    personal_vehicles = (Car, Motorcycle)\n    return issubclass(vehicle_type, personal_vehicles)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(f\"Car: {ispersonal(Car)}\")\nprint(f\"Motorcycle: {ispersonal(Motorcycle)}\")\nprint(f\"Bus: {ispersonal(Bus)}\")\nprint(f\"Truck: {ispersonal(Truck)}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, I've defined an `AbstractVehicle` class and its subtypes: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. The `ispersonal` function checks if the provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle by using the built-in `issubclass` function along with a tuple of personal vehicle types. The example usage at the end demonstrates how to use the `ispersonal` function for different vehicle types.\n\nFeel free to adapt this code to your specific needs and the programming language you prefer.","status":200,"tokens":[108,530],"elapsed":15.9760975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
