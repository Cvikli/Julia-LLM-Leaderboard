All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible solution in Rust, assuming the given types are already defined:\n```rust\npub trait AbstractVehicle {}\npub struct Car;\npub struct Motorcycle;\npub struct Bus;\npub struct Truck;\n\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Car {}\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Motorcycle {}\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Bus {}\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Truck {}\n\npub fn is_personal<T: AbstractVehicle>(_: &T) -> bool {\n    match std::any::type_name::<T>() {\n        \"Car\" => true,\n        \"Motorcycle\" => true,\n        _ => false,\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let car = Car {};\n    let motorcycle = Motorcycle {};\n    let bus = Bus {};\n    let truck = Truck {};\n\n    println!(\"Car is personal: {}\", is_personal(&car)); // true\n    println!(\"Motorcycle is personal: {}\", is_personal(&motorcycle)); // true\n    println!(\"Bus is personal: {}\", is_personal(&bus)); // false\n    println!(\"Truck is personal: {}\", is_personal(&truck)); // false\n}\n```\nNote that this solution uses the `std::any::type_name` function to get the name of the type at runtime, and then compares it to the string literals `\"Car\"` and `\"Motorcycle\"`. This is not the most efficient or idiomatic way to do this in Rust, but it should work for the given requirements.\n\nIn a more realistic scenario, you might want to define a `PersonalVehicle` trait that is implemented for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, and then use trait bounds to constrain the function to only accept types that implement this trait. This would make the code more type-safe and easier to reason about.","status":200,"tokens":[108,431],"elapsed":26.114701416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
