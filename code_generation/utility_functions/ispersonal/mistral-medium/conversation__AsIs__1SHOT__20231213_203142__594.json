All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example of how you can implement the `ispersonal` function in Rust:\n```\ntrait AbstractVehicle {}\n\nstruct Car;\nstruct Motorcycle;\nstruct Bus;\nstruct Truck;\n\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Car {}\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Motorcycle {}\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Bus {}\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Truck {}\n\nfn ispersonal(vehicle: &dyn AbstractVehicle) -> bool {\n    match vehicle {\n        &Car {} | &Motorcycle {} => true,\n        _ => false,\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let my_car: Box<dyn AbstractVehicle> = Box::new(Car {});\n    let my_motorcycle: Box<dyn AbstractVehicle> = Box::new(Motorcycle {});\n    let my_bus: Box<dyn AbstractVehicle> = Box::new(Bus {});\n    let my_truck: Box<dyn AbstractVehicle> = Box::new(Truck {});\n\n    println!(\"{}\", ispersonal(&my_car)); // true\n    println!(\"{}\", ispersonal(&my_motorcycle)); // true\n    println!(\"{}\", ispersonal(&my_bus)); // false\n    println!(\"{}\", ispersonal(&my_truck)); // false\n}\n```\nThe `ispersonal` function takes a reference to a trait object of type `AbstractVehicle` and returns a boolean value indicating whether the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. The function uses a match statement to check the type of the vehicle and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types and `false` for any other types, including `Bus` and `Truck`.\n\nYou can also use the `any` crate which provides the `TypeId` trait that can be used to compare the type of the object at runtime.\n```\nuse std::any::TypeId;\n\ntrait AbstractVehicle {}\n\nstruct Car;\nstruct Motorcycle;\nstruct Bus;\nstruct Truck;\n\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Car {}\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Motorcycle {}\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Bus {}\nimpl AbstractVehicle for Truck {}\n\nfn ispersonal(vehicle: &dyn AbstractVehicle) -> bool {\n    let personal_vehicles = [TypeId::of::<Car>(), TypeId::of::<Motorcycle>()];\n    personal_vehicles.contains(&TypeId::of::<Car>(vehicle))\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let my_car: Box<dyn AbstractVehicle> = Box::new(Car {});\n    let my_motorcycle: Box<dyn AbstractVehicle> = Box::new(Motorcycle {});\n    let my_bus: Box<dyn AbstractVehicle> = Box::new(Bus {});\n    let my_truck: Box<dyn AbstractVehicle> = Box::new(Truck {});\n\n    println!(\"{}\", ispersonal(&my_car)); // true\n    println!(\"{}\", ispersonal(&my_motorcycle)); // true\n    println!(\"{}\", ispersonal(&my_bus)); // false\n    println!(\"{}\", ispersonal(&my_truck)); // false\n}\n```\nThis way you don't need to use the match statement and it is more extensible if you want to add more personal vehicles.\n\nPlease note that the above code is in Rust, if you are using other programming languages the implementation will be different.\n\nLet me know if you have any question or if you need help with anything else.","status":200,"tokens":[108,854],"elapsed":19.175506709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
