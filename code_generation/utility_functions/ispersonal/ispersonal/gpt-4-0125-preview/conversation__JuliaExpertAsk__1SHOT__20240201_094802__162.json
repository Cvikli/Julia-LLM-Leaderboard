All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To define the function `ispersonal`, we start by defining the abstract type `AbstractVehicle`, and then we'll define the specific vehicle types (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`). After that, we implement the `ispersonal` function, using Julia's type system to distinguish between the types that are considered personal vehicles versus those that aren't.\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) = false\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\n\n# Example\n@show ispersonal(Car())       # Should return true\n@show ispersonal(Motorcycle())# Should return true\n@show ispersonal(Bus())       # Should return false\n@show ispersonal(Truck())     # Should return false\n@show ispersonal(\"Random Type\") # Since not a subtype of AbstractVehicle, it will throw an error\n```\n\nThis code snippet defines an abstract type for vehicles and four concrete vehicle types. The `ispersonal` function then leverages Julia's multiple dispatch system to define behavior for each vehicle type, defaulting to `false` for any type that isn't specifically matched, as per the instructions. Note that the final example with \"Random Type\" will not behave as commented since it is not a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` and thus will not match any method of `ispersonal`, leading to a `MethodError`. You cannot call `ispersonal` with a `\"Random Type\"` string as an argument because it does not meet the function's type requirements.","status":200,"tokens":[134,345],"elapsed":33.067270083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
