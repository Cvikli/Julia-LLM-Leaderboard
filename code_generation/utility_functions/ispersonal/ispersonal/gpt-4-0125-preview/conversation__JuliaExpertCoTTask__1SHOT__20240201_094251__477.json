Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`\n2. Subtype `AbstractVehicle` with specific vehicle types: `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`\n3. Define a function `ispersonal` that:\n   - Takes an instance of a subtype of `AbstractVehicle` as an input\n   - Returns `true` if the instance is a `Car` or `Motorcycle`\n   - Returns `false` if the instance is a `Bus` or `Truck`\n   - Defaults to `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`\n\n### Step 2: Write Functions and Other Code\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus || vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Task\n\n```julia\n# Example\nispersonal(Car()) # Using the provided example\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check That Your Solution Is Correct\n\nThe provided code snippet defines the abstract type `AbstractVehicle` along with its subtypes (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`). The `ispersonal` function checks the type of the provided vehicle instance and returns `true` for personal vehicles (`Car`, `Motorcycle`) and `false` for non-personal vehicles (`Bus`, `Truck`), with a default to `false` for any other subtypes. \n\nExecuting `ispersonal(Car())` should return true as per the defined functionality, showing that the solution works as intended.","status":200,"tokens":[196,397],"elapsed":29.081027458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
