All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::Type{<:AbstractVehicle})\n    if vehicle == Car || vehicle == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle == Bus || vehicle == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the following example:\n\n```julia\nprintln(ispersonal(Car))  # should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle))  # should return true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus))  # should return false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck))  # should return false\n```\n\nThis implementation defines the function `ispersonal` that takes a type as an argument and returns `true` if the type is `Car` or `Motorcycle`, and `false` if the type is `Bus` or `Truck`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function will default to returning `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[99,240],"elapsed":1.693381042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
