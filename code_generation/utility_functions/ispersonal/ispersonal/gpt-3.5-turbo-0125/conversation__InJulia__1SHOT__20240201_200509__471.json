All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function takes a type as input and returns true for Car and Motorcycle types, and false for Bus and Truck types. By default, it returns false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[99,239],"elapsed":1.77545825,"_type":"aimessage"}]
