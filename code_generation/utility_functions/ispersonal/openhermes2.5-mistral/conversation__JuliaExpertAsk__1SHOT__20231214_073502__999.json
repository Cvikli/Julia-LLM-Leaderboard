All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n```julia\nmodule AbstractVehicle\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{<AbstractVehicle>})\n    false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Car})\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Motorcycle})\n    true\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Bus})\n    false\nend\n\nfunction ispersonal(::Type{Truck})\n    false\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe `AbstractVehicle` module serves as a base type for all vehicles in the function. The `ispersonal` function takes a type argument of type `AbstractVehicle`, and returns `false` by default.\n\nFor types `Car` and `Motorcycle`, we return `true` because they are personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n\nFor types `Bus` and `Truck`, we return `false` because they are not personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car)\nTrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle)\nTrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus)\nFalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck)\nFalse\n```\nNote that the function only works for types that are subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`. If you try to use it with other types, it will return `false` by default.","status":200,"tokens":[142,353],"elapsed":12.66607575,"_type":"aimessage"}]
