All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The `ispersonal` function takes a type parameter `vehicle` which must be a subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. It returns true if the `vehicle` is either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, and false otherwise.\n\nThe function works as follows:\n1. Define an array `vehicle_types` containing the types `Car` and `Motorcycle`.\n2. Use the `any()` function to check if any element of `vehicle_types` is equal to the provided `vehicle` type.\n3. Return true if there's a match, or false otherwise.\n\nWhen testing the function with `ispersonal(Car())`, it correctly returns true since `Car` is one of the types specified in the `vehicle_types` array.","status":200,"tokens":[225,363],"elapsed":17.156958834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
