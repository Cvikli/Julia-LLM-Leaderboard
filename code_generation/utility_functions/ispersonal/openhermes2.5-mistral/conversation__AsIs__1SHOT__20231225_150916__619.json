This base class serves as a superclass for all types of vehicles. The subclasses `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` inherit from `AbstractVehicle` and override the `is_personal` method with their respective implementations.\n\nThe example implementation assumes that only `Car` and `Motorcycle` are considered personal vehicles, while `Bus` and `Truck` are not. The `isPersonal` function for each subclass returns a boolean indicating whether the vehicle is personal or not.\n\nHere's an example usage of this implementation:\n```python\ncar = Car()\nprint(car.is_personal())  # Output: True\n\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nprint(motorcycle.is_personal())  # Output: True\n\nbus = Bus()\nprint(bus.is_personal())  # Output: False\n\ntruck = Truck()\nprint(truck.is_personal())  # Output: False\n```","status":200,"tokens":[107,417],"elapsed":13.048176042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
