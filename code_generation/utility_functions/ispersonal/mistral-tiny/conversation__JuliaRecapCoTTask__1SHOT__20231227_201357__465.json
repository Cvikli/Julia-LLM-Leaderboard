[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task: defining abstract types, creating concrete types, and writing a function.\n2. Solve the task: Define the abstract type `AbstractVehicle`, create concrete subtypes `Car` and `Motorcycle` that inherit from `AbstractVehicle`, and write a function `ispersonal` that checks the type of the `vehicle` argument.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct: The function correctly returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck` types, as requested.\n\nThis solution adheres to the Julia language guidelines and the given special instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[412,378],"elapsed":3.367538583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
