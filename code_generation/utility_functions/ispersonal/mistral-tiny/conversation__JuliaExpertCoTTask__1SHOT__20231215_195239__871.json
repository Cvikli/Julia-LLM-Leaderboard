The `ispersonal` function checks if the given `veh` is an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle` and sets the `ispersonal` variable to `true` if it is. If `veh` is not an instance of `Car` or `Motorcycle`, the function defaults to `false`. The test cases cover all the given types and the base type `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[220,298],"elapsed":4.654111416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
