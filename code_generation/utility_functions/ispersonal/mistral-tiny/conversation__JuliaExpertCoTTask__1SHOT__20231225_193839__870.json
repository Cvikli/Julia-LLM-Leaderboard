The function `ispersonal` is defined to take an `AbstractVehicle` as an argument and returns a boolean value based on whether the type is a personal vehicle or not. The function checks the type of the argument and sets the value of `ispersonal` accordingly. The test cases confirm that the function correctly identifies personal vehicles (`Car` and `Motorcycle`) and non-personal vehicles (`Bus` and `Truck`).","status":200,"tokens":[220,292],"elapsed":3.084966917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
