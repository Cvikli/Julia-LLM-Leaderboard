All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing AbstractVehicle::AbstractVehicle\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)::Bool\nreturn case (vehicle) of\nCar()-> true;\nMotorcycle -> true;\nBus()-> false;\nTruck()-> false;\n_-> false\nend\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by taking a Vehicle object as input and then using pattern matching to determine if it's of the appropriate type. If the Vehicle object is a Car, Motorcycle or Truck, it returns true (indicating that it's a personal vehicle for everyday driving). If not, it returns false (indicating that it's not a personal vehicle for everyday driving).\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```julia\nx = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(x))-- Outputs: true\n\ny = Motorcycle()\nprintln(ispersonal(y))-- Outputs: true\n\nz = Truck()\nprintln(ispersonal(z))-- Outputs: false\n\na = AbstractVehicle()\nprintln(ispersonal(a)) -- Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[143,274],"elapsed":7.395939209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
