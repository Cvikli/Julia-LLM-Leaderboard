All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `ispersonal` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\nif ismember(vehicle, (Car, Motorcycle))\nreturn true\nelse if ismember(vehicle, (Bus, Truck))\nreturn false\nend\n# Default for any other AbstractVehicle subtype\nreturn false\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `ismember` function to check if the given `vehicle` object belongs to the types `Car` or `Motorcycle`, in which case it returns true. If not, it then checks if the `vehicle` object belongs to the types `Bus` or `Truck`. If it does, it returns false; otherwise, it defaults to returning false for any other AbstractVehicle subtype.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n\n```julia\nabstract_vehicles = (Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck, Bicycle)# Example collection of AbstractVehicle subtypes\n\nfor v in abstract_vehicles\nprintln(v, ispersonal(v))\nend\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nCar true\nMotorcycle true\nBus false\nTruck false\nBicycle false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[143,286],"elapsed":7.721151708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
