We then create two functions, `ispersonal`, that take a vehicle object as input and check if the vehicle is either a car or motorcycle (which are personal vehicles) by using the `ismember` function from the DataStructures library. If the vehicle is either of these types, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false for buses and trucks, which are not considered personal vehicles. The function defaults to false for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[215,257],"elapsed":10.953716458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
