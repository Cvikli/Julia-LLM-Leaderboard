Then, we define an abstract type for vehicles. The function `ispersonal` takes a 2D Vector with two elements representing different vehicles as input. It checks whether the first vehicle is either a Car or a Motorcycle and whether the second vehicle is either a Bus or a Truck. If both conditions are met, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.\n\nHere's an example usage of this function:\n```julia\nveh1 = [Car, Bus]\nveh2 = [Motorcycle, Truck]\nveh3 = [Car, Truck]\nispersonal(veh1)# returns true\nispersonal(veh2)# returns false\nispersonal(veh3)# returns false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[106,278],"elapsed":7.34660225,"_type":"aimessage"}]
