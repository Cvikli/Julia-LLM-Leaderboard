All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can define the function like this:\n```julia\nusing abstract_vehicle\n\nfunction isPersonal(veh::AbstractVehicle)\nif type(veh) == Car || type(veh) == Motorcycle\nreturn true\nelseif type(veh) == Bus || type(veh) == Truck\nreturn false\nend\nend\n```\nThis function checks the `type` of a `veh` and returns true if it is either a Car or a Motorcycle, because these are typically considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. If it's neither a Car nor a Motorcycle (i.e., it is either a Bus or a Truck), then it defaults to false, because buses and trucks are not generally considered as personal vehicles for everyday driving.\nHere's an example of how you would call this function:\n```julia\ncar = Car()\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle()\nbus = Bus()\ntruck = Truck()\n\nprintln(isPersonal(car))# true\nprintln(isPersonal(motorcycle)) # true\nprintln(isPersonal(bus))# false\nprintln(isPersonal(truck))# false\n```\nIn this example, the function correctly identifies a Car and a Motorcycle as personal vehicles but not a Bus or a Truck.","status":200,"tokens":[106,282],"elapsed":7.45331525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
