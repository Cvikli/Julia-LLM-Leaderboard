It does this by examining the subtype of AbstractVehicle and returning true for Cars and Motorcycles, and false for Buses and Trucks. Here's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nvehicle = Car()\nprintln(ispersonal(vehicle))# Outputs: true\n\nvehicle = Truck()\nprintln(ispersonal(vehicle))# Outputs: false\n```","status":200,"tokens":[143,222],"elapsed":6.042803208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
