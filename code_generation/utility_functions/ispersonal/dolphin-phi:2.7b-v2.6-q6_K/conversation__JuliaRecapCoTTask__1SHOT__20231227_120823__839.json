[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

These are subtypes of AbstractVehicle (i.e., Car, Motorcycle). We then use these type checks to return true if the provided vehicle is one of these types and false otherwise. If the provided vehicle is not a Car or Motorcycle, it must be a Bus or Truck; in this case, we also return false. If none of these conditions are met, the function defaults to returning false.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\nispersonal(Car) # returns true\nispersonal(Motorcycle) # returns true\nispersonal(Bus) # returns false\nispersonal(Truck) # returns false\nispersonal(AbstractVehicle()) # returns false by default\n```","status":200,"tokens":[395,268],"elapsed":8.532998708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
