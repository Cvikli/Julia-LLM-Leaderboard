The `AbstractVehicle` class acts as an abstract base class for our vehicle types (Car, Motorcycle, Bus, and Truck), meaning that it is not intended to be instantiated directly, but rather serves as a common parent class for these other classes.\n\nThe function `isPersonal(vehicle_instance)` checks the type of the provided vehicle instance, and returns True if it's an instance of Car or Motorcycle (which are considered \"personal\" vehicles), otherwise it returns False. It also returns False for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, as specified by the else clause in our `if`/`elif` structure.","status":200,"tokens":[110,491],"elapsed":15.104641792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
