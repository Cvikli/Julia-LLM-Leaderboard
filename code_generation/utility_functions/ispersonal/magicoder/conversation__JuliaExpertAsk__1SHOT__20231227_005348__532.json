All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is an example solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle; end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle; end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if typeof(vehicle) == Car || typeof(vehicle) == Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif  typeof(vehicle) == Bus || typeof(vehicle) == Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function `ispersonal` checks the type of a provided vehicle. If it's either a `Car` or a `Motorcycle`, it returns true. If it's a `Bus` or a `Truck`, it returns false. For any other subtype of AbstractVehicle, like `Bicycle <: AbstractVehicle; end`, the function defaults to returning false.","status":200,"tokens":[152,239],"elapsed":7.710033333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
