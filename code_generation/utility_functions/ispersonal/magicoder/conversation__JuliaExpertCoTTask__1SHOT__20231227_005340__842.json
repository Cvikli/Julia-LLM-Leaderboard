The function `ispersonal` is defined to take any type of `AbstractVehicle` as input and returns a Boolean value. Depending on the type of vehicle provided, it returns true for Car and Motorcycle (since they are personal vehicles), false for Bus and Truck (since they are not used for daily driving) and defaults to returning false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[227,400],"elapsed":18.943361375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
