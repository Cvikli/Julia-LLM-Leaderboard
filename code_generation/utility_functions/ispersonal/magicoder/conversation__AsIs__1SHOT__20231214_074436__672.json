Here is a function `isPersonal` that returns a trait indicating whether a provided vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving:\n```\nimport types\n\nclass Vehicle:\n    def __init__(self, type_: str) -> None:\n        self.type = type_\n\nclass Car(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        super().__init__(\"Car\")\n\nclass Motorcycle(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        super().__init__(\"Motorcycle\")\n\nclass Bus(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        super().__init__(\"Bus\")\n\nclass Truck(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        super().__init__(\"Truck\")\n\ndef isPersonal(vehicle_type: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n    if vehicle_type in [\"Car\", \"Motorcycle\"]:\n        return True\n    elif vehicle_type in [\"Bus\", \"Truck\"]:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False  # Default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle\n\n# Example usage:\nvehicle_type = \"Car\"\nprint(isPersonal(vehicle_type)) # Output: True\n\nvehicle_type = \"Truck\"\nprint(isPersonal(vehicle_type)) # Output: False\n```\nIn this implementation, we define a `Vehicle` class that represents the base type for all vehicles. Then, we define subclasses for `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`. Finally, we define the `isPersonal` function that takes a vehicle type as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's a personal vehicle for everyday driving.\n\nThe function first checks if the provided vehicle type is either \"Car\" or \"Motorcycle\", in which case it returns `True`. Otherwise, it checks if the vehicle type is either \"Bus\" or \"Truck\", in which case it returns `False`. If the vehicle type is not any of these, it returns `False` by default.\n\nIn the example usage, we call the `isPersonal` function with the input `vehicle_type = \"Car\"` and it returns `True`, as expected. Similarly, when we call it with `vehicle_type = \"Truck\"` it returns `False`.","status":200,"tokens":[96,574],"elapsed":19.98516325,"_type":"aimessage"}]
