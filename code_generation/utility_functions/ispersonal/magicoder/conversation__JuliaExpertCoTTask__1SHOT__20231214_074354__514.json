All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Think through the approach step by step:\n\t* Identify the types of vehicles that are personal vehicles for everyday driving (Cars, Motorcycles, Buses, Trucks)\n\t* Determine the common trait among these types that can be used to identify them as personal vehicles\n2. Write any functions and other code needed:\n\t* Create a function `ispersonal` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` object as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is a personal vehicle for everyday driving\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Test the function with different types of vehicles:\n\t\t+ Car(): Returns true, as Cars are generally considered personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n\t\t+ Motorcycle(): Returns true, as Motorcycles are also personal vehicles for everyday driving.\n\t\t+ Bus(): Returns false, as Buses are not typically used for everyday driving and are not considered personal vehicles.\n\t\t+ Truck(): Returns false, as Trucks are also not typically used for everyday driving and are not considered personal vehicles.\n\t\t+ Other subtype of AbstractVehicle(): Returns false, as the function is designed to default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.\n4. Check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the function returns the expected values for the given inputs\n\nHere is an example implementation of the `ispersonal` function:\n```julia\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    return v == Car() || v == Motorcycle()\nend\n```\nThis function checks if the input vehicle is a Car or a Motorcycle, as these are the only types of vehicles that are generally considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. If the input is not a Car or Motorcycle, the function returns false.","status":200,"tokens":[217,414],"elapsed":15.789522458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
