All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation in Julia:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(veh::T) where {T<:AbstractVehicle}\n    if T in [Car, Motorcycle]\n        return true\n    elseif T in [Bus, Truck]\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Test cases\nprintln(ispersonal(Car())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Motorcycle())) # true\nprintln(ispersonal(Bus())) # false\nprintln(ispersonal(Truck())) # false\n```\nIn this example, the function `ispersonal` checks if a given vehicle type is either a Car or Motorcycle by using pattern matching with abstract types. If it's not a car or motorcycle, it returns false. This implementation works for all subtypes of AbstractVehicle.","status":200,"tokens":[152,246],"elapsed":7.885561167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
