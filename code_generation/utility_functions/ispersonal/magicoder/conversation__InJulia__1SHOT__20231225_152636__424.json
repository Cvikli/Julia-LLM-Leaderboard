We then define a function `ispersonal` for each of these vehicle types. For `Car` and `Motorcycle`, we return true, because they are typically used for personal purposes. For `Bus` and `Truck`, we return false, as these are generally not considered personal vehicles due to their larger size and intended use in public transportation. \n\nNow let's test the function with a few example types:\n```julia\njulia> ispersonal(Car())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Motorcycle())\ntrue\n\njulia> ispersonal(Bus())\nfalse\n\njulia> ispersonal(Truck())\nfalse\n\n```","status":200,"tokens":[113,334],"elapsed":10.321748583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
