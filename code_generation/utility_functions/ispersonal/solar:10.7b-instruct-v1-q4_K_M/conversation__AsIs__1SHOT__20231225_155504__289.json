All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create the `ispersonal` function, we can use Python as an example since it is a popular language for functional programming. Here's how the function could be written:\n\n```python\nclass AbstractVehicle:\n    pass\n\nclass Car(AbstractVehicle):\n    def __init__(self, color):\n        self.color = color\n\nclass Motorcycle(AbstractVehicle):\n    def __init__(self, cylinders):\n        self.cylinders = cylinders\n\nclass Bus(AbstractVehicle):\n    def __init__(self, seats):\n        self.seats = seats\n\nclass Truck(AbstractVehicle):\n    def __init__(self, load_capacity):\n        self.load_capacity = load_capacity\n\ndef ispersonal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle) -> bool:\n    if isinstance(vehicle, Car) or isinstance(vehicle, Motorcycle):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Bus) or isinstance(vehicle, Truck):\n        return False\n    else:\n        # Default for any other subtypes of AbstractVehicle\n        return False\n\ncar = Car('red')\nmotorcycle = Motorcycle(4)\nbus = Bus(50)\ntruck = Truck(20000)\n\nprint(ispersonal(car))  # True\nprint(ispersonal(motorcycle))  # True\nprint(ispersonal(bus))  # False\nprint(ispersonal(truck))  # False\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ispersonal` function checks if the input vehicle object is of type Car or Motorcycle, which are considered personal vehicles. If it detects either of these types, it returns True; otherwise, for Bus and Truck instances, it returns False. For other subtypes not mentioned in the function's conditions (like Bicycle, Boat, etc.), the function will return `False`.","status":200,"tokens":[109,435],"elapsed":25.893863,"_type":"aimessage"}]
