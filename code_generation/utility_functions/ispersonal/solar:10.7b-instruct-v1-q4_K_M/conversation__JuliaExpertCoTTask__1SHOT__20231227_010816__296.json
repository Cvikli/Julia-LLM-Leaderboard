It returns `true` if it's a `Car` or `Motorcycle`, which are considered personal vehicles for everyday driving. For other subtypes, like `Bus` and `Truck`, it returns `false`. In case of any unknown subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function also defaults to `false`. The provided example shows how this function can be used with a `Car()` instance.","status":200,"tokens":[227,278],"elapsed":26.655633708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
