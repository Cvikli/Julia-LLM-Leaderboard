All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `isPersonal` function:\n```\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom abstract_vehicle import AbstractVehicle\n\ndef is_personal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns true if the provided vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving, false otherwise.\n\n    :param vehicle: The vehicle to check\n    :return: True if personal, False otherwise\n    \"\"\"{\n        if isinstance(vehicle, Car):\n            return True\n        elif isinstance(vehicle, Motorcycle):\n            return True\n        elif isinstance(vehicle, Bus):\n            return False\n        elif isinstance(vehicle, Truck):\n            return False\n        else:\n            return False\n    }\n```\nHere's an example of how you could use this function:\n```\nvehicle = AbstractVehicle(\"Tesla Model S\")\nprint(is_personal(vehicle)) # Output: False\n\nvehicle = AbstractVehicle(\"Toyota Corolla\")\nprint(is_personal(vehicle)) # Output: True\n\nvehicle = AbstractVehicle(\"Ford F-150\")\nprint(is_personal(vehicle)) # Output: False\n\nvehicle = AbstractVehicle(\"Harley-Davidson Electra Glide\")\nprint(is_personal(vehicle)) # Output: False\n```\nIn this example, we pass in different types of vehicles and the function returns `True` for personal vehicles (cars and motorcycles) and `False` for non-personal vehicles (buses and trucks). The function also defaults to returning `False` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[96,410],"elapsed":14.059527792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
