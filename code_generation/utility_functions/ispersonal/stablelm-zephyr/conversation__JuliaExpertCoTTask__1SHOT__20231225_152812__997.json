Then, four subtypes (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`) extend the `Vehicle` class and implement the `ispersonal()` method to return the desired behavior. The example usage demonstrates how to call the `ispersonal()` function for different vehicle types and observe the expected output.","status":200,"tokens":[220,322],"elapsed":6.215816416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
