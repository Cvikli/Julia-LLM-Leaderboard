The `Bus` and `Truck` are also subtypes of `AbstractVehicle`, but in this case, they return false when tested with the `ispersonal` function. \n\nWhen you run the code snippet provided, it will output \"false\" because a `Truck` is not considered a personal vehicle for everyday driving. You can test other types of vehicles to see their results.","status":200,"tokens":[150,325],"elapsed":5.964264125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
