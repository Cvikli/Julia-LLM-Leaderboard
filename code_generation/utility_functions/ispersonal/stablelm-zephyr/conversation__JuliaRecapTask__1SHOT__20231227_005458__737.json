[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nWrite a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Then, we create specific classes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck` that inherit from the `Vehicle` base type and override their traits to return false when appropriate.\n\nThe function `IsPersonal<Vehicle>()` checks if a given vehicle is personal for everyday driving. It uses pattern matching with `is` keywords to check which specific types of vehicles are being tested. The conditions include:\n- Checking if the vehicle type is Car or Motorcycle (returns true)\n- Checking if the brand and model are either unknown or \"Personal\" (returns true)\n- Checking if the year is less than or equal to 15 (returns true for cars)\n- Excluding truck and bus types (returns false for both).\n\nThis solution assumes that personal vehicles in the context of this function should be those driven daily. The conditions may need to be adjusted based on specific requirements, but this provides a good starting point.","status":200,"tokens":[398,494],"elapsed":10.711340417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
