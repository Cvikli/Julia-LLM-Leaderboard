First, we define the base class `AbstractVehicle` and create an object to hold the types we want to check against for personal vehicles.\n2. We then create a dictionary called `personal_vehicle_types`, which maps each type (e.g., \"Car\") to its corresponding usage (\"everyday-driving\" or \"recreational-riding\").\n3. In our `ispersonal` function, we first check if the vehicle is either a car or motorcycle and belongs to the personal types for everyday driving. If it does, we return `True`.\n4. If the vehicle type is bus or truck (we consider trucks as general vehicles since they can be used for various purposes), we always return `false`.\n5. Finally, if the vehicle doesn't fall into either of these categories, we default to returning `false` since it's not a personal vehicle for everyday driving.","status":200,"tokens":[220,391],"elapsed":10.350692167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
