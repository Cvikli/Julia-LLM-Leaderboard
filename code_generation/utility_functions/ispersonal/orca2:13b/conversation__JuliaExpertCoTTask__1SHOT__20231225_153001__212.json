Think through the approach: The function should check if the vehicle type is a personal vehicle or not. Personal vehicles are mostly used for everyday driving, so they might have different features than other types of vehicles. We need to consider the most common personal vehicles and their subtypes.\n2. Write any functions and other code needed: Since we have only one function to define, we can directly write the code.\n3. Solve the task: The main function is `ispersonal`, which should return true for Car and Motorcycle, false for Bus and Truck, and false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. We can use a switch statement or a series of if-else statements to check the vehicle type and return the corresponding trait.\n4. Check that the solution is correct: We can test the function with different types of vehicles and see if it returns the expected result.\n\n# Code\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif vehicle isa Bus\n        return false\n    elseif vehicle isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n\n# Example\n\nispersonal(Car()) -> true\nispersonal(Motorcycle()) -> true\nispersonal(Bus()) -> false\nispersonal(Truck()) -> false\nispersonal(Airplane()) -> false","status":200,"tokens":[230,328],"elapsed":19.60097,"_type":"aimessage"}]
