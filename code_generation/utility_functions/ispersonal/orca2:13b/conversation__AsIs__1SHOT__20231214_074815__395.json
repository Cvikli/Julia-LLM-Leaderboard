[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"Write a function `ispersonal` that returns a trait if the provided Vehicle type is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is a possible implementation of the `isPersonal` function:\n```\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom abstract_vehicle import AbstractVehicle\n\ndef is_personal(vehicle: AbstractVehicle) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the vehicle is a personal vehicle for everyday driving, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(vehicle, Car):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Motorcycle):\n        return True\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Bus):\n        return False\n    elif isinstance(vehicle, Truck):\n        return False\n    else:\n        return False\n```\nHere's an example of how you can use the function:\n```\nvehicle = AbstractVehicle(\"My Car\")\nprint(is_personal(vehicle)) # Output: True\n\nvehicle = AbstractVehicle(\"My Motorcycle\")\nprint(is_personal(vehicle)) # Output: True\n\nvehicle = AbstractVehicle(\"The City Bus\")\nprint(is_personal(vehicle)) # Output: False\n\nvehicle = AbstractVehicle(\"My Truck\")\nprint(is_personal(vehicle)) # Output: False\n```\nNote that the function only considers vehicles that are typically used for everyday driving. Personal vehicles like cars and motorcycles are generally used for commuting, running errands, and other daily activities, while buses and trucks are typically used for larger groups or cargo transportation.","status":200,"tokens":[96,356],"elapsed":12.172243333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
