All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle. Provide an example.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the `ispersonal` function that meets your requirements:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nispersonal(::Car) = true\nispersonal(::Motorcycle) = true\nispersonal(::AbstractVehicle) where {T<:AbstractVehicle} = false\n\n# Example\nispersonal(Car()) # returns: true\n```\n\nThis implementation uses Julia's multiple dispatch feature to define the `ispersonal` function for different types of `AbstractVehicle`. We define a generic `ispersonal` function that defaults to returning `false` for any subtype of `AbstractVehicle`. Then, we provide specific implementations for `Car` and `Motorcycle` types to return `true`.\n\nIn summary, the function `ispersonal` can be used to determine if a given `AbstractVehicle` instance is a personal vehicle suitable for everyday driving. It returns `true` for instances of `Car` and `Motorcycle` and `false` for instances of `Bus` and `Truck`. For any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`, the function defaults to returning `false`.","status":200,"tokens":[146,291],"elapsed":3.926932,"_type":"aimessage"}]
