All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

The function uses type checking to determine whether the input `vehicle` is a `Car` or a `Motorcycle` (in which case it returns `true`) or some other subtype of `AbstractVehicle` (in which case it returns `false` by default).","status":200,"tokens":[105,284],"elapsed":3.857385292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
