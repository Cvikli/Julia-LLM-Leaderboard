All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`\n   - Define subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, and `Truck`\n   - Define a function `ispersonal` that takes an `AbstractVehicle` as an argument and returns `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, `false` for `Bus` and `Truck`, and defaults to `false` for any other subtype\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(v::AbstractVehicle)\n    if v isa Car || v isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    elseif v isa Bus || v isa Truck\n        return false\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3.

It also returns `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[220,402],"elapsed":5.461760542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
