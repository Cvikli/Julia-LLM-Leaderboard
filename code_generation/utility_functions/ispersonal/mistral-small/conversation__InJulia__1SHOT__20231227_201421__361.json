If the vehicle is one of those two types, the function returns `true`, indicating that it is a personal vehicle for everyday driving. Otherwise, the function returns `false`, indicating that it is not a personal vehicle. The function defaults to returning `false` for any other subtype of `AbstractVehicle`.","status":200,"tokens":[105,290],"elapsed":4.025383417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
