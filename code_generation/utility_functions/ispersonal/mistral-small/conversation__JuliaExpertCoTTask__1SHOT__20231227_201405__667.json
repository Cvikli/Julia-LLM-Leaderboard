All vehicles are subtypes of AbstractVehicle. Function must work for types: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck. The first two should return true, the latter two should return false . The function should default to false for any other subtype of AbstractVehicle.

Think through the approach step by step:\n\t* Define an abstract type `AbstractVehicle`\n\t* Define subtypes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`\n\t* Define a function `ispersonal` that takes an abstract vehicle as an argument and returns a boolean based on the subtype.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nabstract type AbstractVehicle end\n\nstruct Car <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Motorcycle <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Bus <: AbstractVehicle end\nstruct Truck <: AbstractVehicle end\n\nfunction ispersonal(vehicle::AbstractVehicle)\n    if vehicle isa Car || vehicle isa Motorcycle\n        return true\n    else\n        return false\n    end\nend\n```\n3. Solve the task:\n\nThe function `ispersonal` has been defined to return `true` for `Car` and `Motorcycle` objects and `false` for `Bus` and `Truck` objects.\n\n4.
