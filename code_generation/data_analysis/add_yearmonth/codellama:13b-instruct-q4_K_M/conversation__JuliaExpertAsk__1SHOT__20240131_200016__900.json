The resulting values are then concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\" using string interpolation and the `Int64` constructor. Finally, the resulting vector of integers is assigned to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,160],"elapsed":2.081841447,"_type":"aimessage"}]
