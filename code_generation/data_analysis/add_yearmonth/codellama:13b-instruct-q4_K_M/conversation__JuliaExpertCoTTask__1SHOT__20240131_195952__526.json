The `map` function is used to apply the formatting to each element of the `df[:dt]` column.\n* We use the `format` method from `Dates` to format each date as an integer in format \"yyyymm\". The \"yymm\" format string tells `format` to include the year and month, without any leading zeroes for the month (so 5 becomes 05).\n* We assign the result of the `map` function to a new column `:ym` in the same DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,200],"elapsed":2.635099228,"_type":"aimessage"}]
