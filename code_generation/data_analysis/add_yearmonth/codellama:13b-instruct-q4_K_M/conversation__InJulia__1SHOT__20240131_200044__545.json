Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[:ym] = @. Int64(\"$(@year($(df[:dt])))$(@month($(df[:dt])))\")\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `@.` macro to broadcast the `Int64` constructor over the entire column, which is more efficient than applying it element-wise using a loop. The `@year` and `@month` functions are used to extract the year and month from the `DateTime` values in the `dt` column, respectively. The resulting integers are then concatenated together as a string using `$(@year($(df[:dt])))$(@month($(df[:dt])))\"` and converted back to an integer using `Int64`.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the `dt` column is of type `DateTime`, if it's not, you may need to convert it first. Also, the resulting `ym` column will be in the format \"yyyymm\", for example \"202305\" for May 2023.","status":200,"tokens":[0,234],"elapsed":3.039304578,"_type":"aimessage"}]
