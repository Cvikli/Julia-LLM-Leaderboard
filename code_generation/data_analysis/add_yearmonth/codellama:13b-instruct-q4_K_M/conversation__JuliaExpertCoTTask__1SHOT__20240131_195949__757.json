The `Dates.format` function takes a DateTime object and formats it as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, the resulting vector is returned as a DataFrame with a single column named `:ym`.\n\nTo use this function on your data, you can call it like so:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nNote that if your `DataFrame` has more than one row, this function will add the `ym` column to each row in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[257,188],"elapsed":10.661309108,"_type":"aimessage"}]
