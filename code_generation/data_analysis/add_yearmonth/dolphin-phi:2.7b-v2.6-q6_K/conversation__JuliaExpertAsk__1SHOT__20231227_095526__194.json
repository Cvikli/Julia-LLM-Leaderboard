For each row, it extracts the year and month from the `dt` column using the `year` and `month` methods of the `DateTime`, converts them to strings, concatenates them together with a space in between, and then maps this string back into an integer. The result is a new array containing the extracted years and months as integers in \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[122,155],"elapsed":4.214202791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
