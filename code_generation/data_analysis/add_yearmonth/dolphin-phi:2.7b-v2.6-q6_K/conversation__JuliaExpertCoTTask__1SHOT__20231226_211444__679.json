We start by importing necessary libraries, `DataFrame` and `Dates`.\n2. Then we define a function `add_yearmonth`, which takes a DataFrame `df` as input.\n3. Inside this function, we create a new column in the DataFrame called `ym` using the line `df[[\"ym\"]] = Dates.toInts(Dates.dt2str(df[\"dt\"]))`. This line of code is where we extract year and month from each DateTime object in the 'dt' column and concatenate them into a string with the format \"yyyymm\". We then convert this string into an integer using `Dates.toInts` and store it in the new `ym` column.\n4. Finally, we call this function on the given DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[234,246],"elapsed":10.450140584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
