Then, you can use the `join` function with the `str:format` operator to concatenate them into the desired format \"yyyymm\". Here's an example implementation of the `add_yearmonth` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrame\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\ndf[\"ym\"] = dt.(format(\"%Y%m\", year, month))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `\"ym\"` to it by calling the `dt` method on each row of the `df`. The `format` function with \"yyyymm\" format is used to concatenate the year and month, which are obtained using the `year` and `month` attributes of the `dt` object. Finally, the new column `\"ym\"` is added to the DataFrame.\n\nNote: Make sure you have the `DataFrame` library installed in your Julia environment before running this code. You can install it by adding the following line to your preamble:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrame::Base\n```","status":200,"tokens":[122,283],"elapsed":7.512610875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
