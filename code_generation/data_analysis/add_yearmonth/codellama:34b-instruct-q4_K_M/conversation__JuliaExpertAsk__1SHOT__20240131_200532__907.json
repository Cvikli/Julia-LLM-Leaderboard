The resulting values are then concatenated together into a string in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nNote that this function uses the `map` function to apply the transformation to each element of the `df.dt` column. This allows us to avoid using a loop, which would be less efficient and less idiomatic in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":5.577623856,"_type":"aimessage"}]
