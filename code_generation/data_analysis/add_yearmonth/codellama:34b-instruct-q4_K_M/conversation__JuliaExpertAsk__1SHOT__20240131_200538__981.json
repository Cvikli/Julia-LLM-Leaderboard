The `.|>` operator is used to apply the anonymous function to each element of the `dt` column, which is assumed to be of type `DateTime`. The `parse(Int, ...)` function converts the strings obtained by concatenating the year and month into integers.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the `dt` column in the input `DataFrame` object `df` contains only valid `DateTime` values. If the `dt` column contains invalid values or missing data, additional error handling may be needed to ensure the correctness of the output.","status":200,"tokens":[0,213],"elapsed":5.855350507,"_type":"aimessage"}]
