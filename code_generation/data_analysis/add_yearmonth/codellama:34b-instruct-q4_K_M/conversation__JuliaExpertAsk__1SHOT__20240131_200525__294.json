Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nHere is a function `add_yearmonth` that does what you described:\n```\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = map(x -> string(Dates.year(x), lpad(Dates.month(x), 2, '0')), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each element of the `df.dt` column. The lambda function takes a DateTime object `x` and extracts the year and month using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions, respectively. It then concatenates these values into a string in the format \"yyyymm\" using the `string` function and the `lpad` function to left-pad the month with zeroes if necessary. Finally, it assigns this new column to the `df.ym` column of the DataFrame.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the `dt` column is of type DateTime. If your column has a different type, you will need to adjust the lambda function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,245],"elapsed":6.732907424,"_type":"aimessage"}]
