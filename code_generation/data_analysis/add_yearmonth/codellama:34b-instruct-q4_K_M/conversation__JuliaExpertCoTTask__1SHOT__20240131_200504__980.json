The `add_yearmonth` function takes a DataFrame as input and returns the same DataFrame with an additional column `ym` that contains the extracted year and month from the `dt` column.\n2. The `extract_yearmonth` function is called within the `add_yearmonth` function to extract the year and month from each DateTime value in the `dt` column of the input DataFrame. It returns a tuple containing the year and month as integers.\n3. The `string.` operator is used to concatenate the year and month into a string in the format \"yyyymm\".\n4. The function returns the modified DataFrame with the new `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,301],"elapsed":8.336702783,"_type":"aimessage"}]
