Below is an example of how you could write such a function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::AbstractDataFrame)\n    new_col = [Year(dt) * 100 + Month(dt) for dt in df[:, :dt]]\n    return vcat!(df, ym=new_col)\nend\n\n# Example usage with a DataFrame:\ndf = # Your dataframe example here\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nIn this function, we create a new vector `new_col` where each element is the concatenation of the year and month as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". We then use `vcat!` to add this column to the DataFrame in place. Note that `vcat!` modifies the original DataFrame, which is why we use the `!` suffix.\n\nMake sure to replace `# Your dataframe example here` with your actual DataFrame and adjust the function as needed for your specific use case.","status":200,"tokens":[83,268],"elapsed":36.294248,"_type":"aimessage"}]
