X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Let's solve this problem using the systematic approach outlined above. Here are the steps we will follow:\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n\n* We can use the `Date` type to manipulate DateTimes in Julia.\n* The `format` function can be used to extract specific parts of a DateTime, such as the year and month.\n* We can use the `concatenate` function to concatenate strings together.\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe can write the following code to create the new column `ym`:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Extract year and month from DateTime column\n    ym = df[\"dt\"].format(\"yyyy MM\")\n    return df with new column \"ym\" = ym\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\n* We can verify that the new column `ym` contains the expected format by checking its type and value.\n* We can also check that the original `dt` column has not been modified during the function execution.\n\nHere's the complete code for the function `add_yearmonth`:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Extract year and month from DateTime column\n    ym = df[\"dt\"].format(\"yyyy MM\")\n    return df with new column \"ym\" = ym\nend\n\n# Example usage\nusing DataFrames\ndf = DataFrame(\"dt\" => DateInterval([2022-01-01, 2022-01-31]),\n                 \"x\" => 1:5)\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis code should create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`, containing the extracted year and month values formatted as \"yyyymm\".
