It creates a new column called `ym` in the DataFrame by extracting and concatenating the year and month from each date-time value stored in the `dt` column. This is achieved using the `map()` function, which iterates over every row of the `dt` column.\n\nWithin the iteration, `year(x)` retrieves the year component of a date-time object `x`, and `month(x)` extracts its month component. The `string()` function converts these values to strings before concatenating them together using multiplication (`*`). \n\nThe integer representation of the concatenated string is then assigned to the new column `ym` for each row in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[122,224],"elapsed":41.630213708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
