Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a brief and concise solution to the problem you've described:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = DateTime(df[:dt]) . YearMonth\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. `df[:ym]` creates a new column in the DataFrame called `ym`.\n2. `.YearMonth` extracts the year and month from each `dt` value using the `DateTime` function.\n3. The resulting year and month values are concatenated as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the `dt` column contains DateTime values in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\". If your `dt` column has a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[112,185],"elapsed":6.623014542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
