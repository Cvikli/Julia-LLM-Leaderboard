Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that meets the given requirement:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = DateTimeArray(DateTime, df.dt) |> map(x -> Int(round(DateTime(year(x), month(x), 1), \"u\") * 100)), df)\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes the `df` DataFrame as an input argument. Inside, we create a new column named `ym` using `df.ym = ...`. The pipe operator (`|>`) allows us to chain operations on our DateTimeArray. \n\nFirst, we map a lambda function over each element of our DateTimeArray. This function extracts the year and month from an input date time `x` using the built-in functions `year()` and `month()`. These extracted values are then concatenated together by converting the resulting Date to a Unix timestamp (using `round(DateTime, \"u\")`) and multiplying it by 100. This produces an integer in the desired format (\"yyyymm\").\n\nFinally, we assign this transformed data back into our DataFrame using the same column name as specified in df and return the modified DataFrame for further use.","status":200,"tokens":[129,277],"elapsed":17.025526125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
