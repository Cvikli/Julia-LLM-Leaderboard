Based on the problem statement and guidelines provided, here are the steps I will follow to solve the task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* DateTime manipulation functions such as `DateDiff`, `YearDay`, `MonthDay`\n\t* String concatenation using `$` operator\n\t* Creating a new column in a DataFrame\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Create a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame `df` as input and returns a new DataFrame with a new column `ym` containing the year and month extracted from `dt` column using `DateDiff` and concatenated using `$` operator.\n\t```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    y = DateDiff(df[\"dt\"], Date(\"1970-01-01\")) .Year\n    m = DateDiff(df[\"dt\"], Date(\"1970-01-01\")) .Month\n    \n    # Concat year and month as integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df[\"ym\"] = string($y, $m)\n    return df\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the function correctly extracts the year and month from `dt` column using `DateDiff`\n\t* Check that the concatenated value in `ym` column is in the format \"yyyymm\" as expected\n4. Test the function with a sample DataFrame:\n\t* Create a sample DataFrame with a `dt` column containing DateTimes\n\t* Call the `add_yearmonth` function on the DataFrame to add the new `ym` column\n\t* Verify that the resulting DataFrame contains the expected year and month values in the `ym` column\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n\n* Key syntax includes variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation.\n* Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested.\n* Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive.
