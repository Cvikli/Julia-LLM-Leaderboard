Then it uses the `YearMonth` function from the `DateTime` package to transform each element in the column `dt` into a tuple containing the year and month, which when used as an array of elements is equivalent to converting the date into its year-month format (`yyyymm`). Finally, this new integer column `ym` is appended to the input DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[129,193],"elapsed":12.180652458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
