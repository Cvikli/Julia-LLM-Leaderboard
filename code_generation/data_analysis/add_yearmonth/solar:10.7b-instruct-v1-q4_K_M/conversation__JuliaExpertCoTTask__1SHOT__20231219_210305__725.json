Here is my solution to the task:\n\n```\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from df.dt column\n    ym = map((dt) -> DateTime.year(dt).toString() .\"$\". substring(DateTime.month(dt), 1, 2), df.dt)\n    # Concat year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df[\"ym\"] = ym\n    return df\nend\n\n# Testing the function with some example data\ndf_example = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2015, 7, 4), DateTime(2020, 10, 31)])\nadd_yearmonth(df_example)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. First, we extract the year and month from the `dt` column of the DataFrame using the `map()` function. The `map()` function applies a function to each element in the DataFrame's `dt` column, in this case, `DateTime.year()` and `DateTime.month()`.\n2. Then, we concatenate the year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\" using the `$` character to separate the year and month.\n3. Finally, we assign the new column `ym` to the DataFrame using the `df[\"ym\"] = ...` line.\n\nI hope this helps!
