Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a possible implementation of the `add_yearmonth` function:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = String(format(\"%04d%02d\", take(df[:dt], 11, Int64), take(df[:dt], 2, Int64)))\n    return df\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `take(df[:dt], 11, Int64)` extracts the year from the `dt` column using the leading zero-padding. The `11` is the number of digits in the year (e.g., 2023 becomes 0023).\n* `take(df[:dt], 2, Int64)` extracts the month from the `dt` column using the leading zero-padding. The `2` is the number of digits in the month (e.g., March becomes 03).\n* `String(format(\"%04d%02d\", ...))` formats the year and month as an integer in the desired format (\"yyyymm\").\n\nNow you can call the function on your DataFrame like this: `add_yearmonth(df)`.","status":200,"tokens":[1,280],"elapsed":8.974845792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
