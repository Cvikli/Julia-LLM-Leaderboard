Here's a concise solution to create a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column of a DataFrame `df`:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df) = collect(year(df[:dt]), month(df[:dt]))\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `collect(year(df[:dt]), month(df[:dt]))` extracts the year and month from the `dt` column using the `year()` and `month()` functions, respectively.\n* `collect()` creates a new DataFrame with the extracted year and month values as columns.\n\nNow you can use this function to add a new column `ym` to your original DataFrame `df`:\n```julia\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[1,184],"elapsed":5.791127416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
