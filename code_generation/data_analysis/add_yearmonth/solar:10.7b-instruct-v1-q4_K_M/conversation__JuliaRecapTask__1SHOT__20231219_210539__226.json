[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Let's get started on solving the task at hand using the Julia language.\n\nStep 1 - Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\n* Date and time manipulation functions: `Date`, `Time`, `DateTime`\n* Extracting year and month from a DateTime: `Year(dt)`, `Month(dt)`\n* ConCATenating integers: `${a}.${b}`\n\nStep 2 - Solve the task:\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from df.dt column\n    ym = Year(df.dt).*100 + Month(df.dt)\n    # Create a new column in df with the extracted year and month\n    df[:ym] = ym\n    return df\nend\n\nStep 3 - Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\n# Verify that the new column 'ym' has the correct format\nprintln(\"Verifying that 'ym' column has correct format...\")\nfor row in df\n    print(row[\"ym\"])\nend\n\n# Check that the values in the 'ym' column are correctly calculated\nprintln(\"Verifying that 'ym' values are correctly calculated...\")\nfor row in df\n    year, month = Month(df[\"ym\"][row])\n    print(year, \" \", month)\nend\n\nGreat!
