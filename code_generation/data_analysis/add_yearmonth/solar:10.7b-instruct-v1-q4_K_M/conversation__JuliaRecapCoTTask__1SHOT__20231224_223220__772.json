[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

In this case, we will make use of DataFrames and Dates packages.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Create a new column \"ym\" in the given `df`\n    df.ym = map(row -> yearmonth(dt, \"yyyymm\") \n                    for (dt::DateTime) in df.dt)\n\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nHere's how the function works:\n1. We first use Julia's pattern matching to extract `DateTime` values from the `df`.\n2. The `yearmonth` function is provided by Dates and returns a string with year-month format when given a DateTime object and the desired format (\"yyyymm\").\n3. We then use the map function to apply this conversion on each element of our `df.dt`, storing results in the new column `df.ym`.\n4. Finally, the modified DataFrame is returned from the function for further processing or manipulation.","status":200,"tokens":[396,259],"elapsed":18.408535417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
