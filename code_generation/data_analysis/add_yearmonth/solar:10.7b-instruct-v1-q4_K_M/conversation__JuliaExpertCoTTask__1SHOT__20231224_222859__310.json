Define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes `df` as an argument.\n2. Inside the function, create a new column `ym` using the `push!` function to add it to `df`.\n3. Use Julia's built-in DateFunctions to extract year and month from each date in the `dt` column.\n4. Combine year and month into an integer string using the `join.()` function with a separator of `\"\"`.\n5. Assign this new value to the newly created `ym` column for each row.\n6. Return the updated `df`.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    push!(df, :ym) # Add a new column 'ym' to the DataFrame\n    \n    ym = df.dt .-> (join.(Int(year(it)), Int(month(it)), \"\")) # Create lambda function for extracting year and month\n    df.ym .= map(ym, df.dt) # Apply lambda function on 'dt' column to assign new values to 'ym' column\n    \n    return df\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test our function with the given `df`.\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nresult = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis function should create a new column `ym` with the extracted year and month in the format \"yyyymm\" for each row.","status":200,"tokens":[256,388],"elapsed":34.214460417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
