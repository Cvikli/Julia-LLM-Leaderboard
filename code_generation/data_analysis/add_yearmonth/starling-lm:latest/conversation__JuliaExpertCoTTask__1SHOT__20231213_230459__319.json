Let's get started.\n\nGiven the `df` DataFrame with column `dt` representing DateTimes, I will create a new function `add_yearmonth` that extracts the year and month from each DateTime and concatenates them as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n\nHere are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n\t* Extract the year and month from each DateTime using the `YearMonth` type from the `DateTime` package.\n\t* Concatenate the year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\t* Define the `add_yearmonth` function that takes a DataFrame as input and returns the modified DataFrame with the new column `ym`.\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Apply the `add_yearmonth` function to the `df` DataFrame.\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the resulting DataFrame has a new column `ym` containing the concatenated year and month values in format \"yyyymm\".\n\nHere is the code for the `add_yearmonth` function:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from each DateTime\n    ym = map(dt -> YearMonth(dt), df.dt)\n    \n    # Concatenate year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df[:ym] = map(yt -> string(Year(yt)) . \"-\" . string(Month(yt)), ym)\n    return df\nend\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[239,385],"elapsed":15.165536791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
