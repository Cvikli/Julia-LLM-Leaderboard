Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Extract year and month from `dt` column of DataFrame `df`.\n   - Concatenate them as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n   - Add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame with the concatenated values.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from dt column of df\n    years = [date(d)[1] for d in eachrow(df[:dt])]\n    months = [date(d)[2] for d in eachrow(df[:dt])]\n    \n    # Concatenate them as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    ym_values = [parse(Int64, string(year) * string(month)) for (year, month) in zip(years, months)]\n    \n    # Add a new column ym to the DataFrame with the concatenated values\n    return df[:, [:dt]...] .= convert.(Vector{Int64}, ym_values);\nend\n```\n3. Solve the task:\n\nLet's add the `add_yearmonth` function to your DataFrame and solve the problem by running it on the provided Data:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\n# Create a DataFrame with the given data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Add the ym column to the DataFrame using the add_yearmonth function\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nAfter running the code, you should have a new DataFrame `df` with an added column `ym`. Verify if all the values in the `ym` column are correctly concatenated as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[256,486],"elapsed":21.599678042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
