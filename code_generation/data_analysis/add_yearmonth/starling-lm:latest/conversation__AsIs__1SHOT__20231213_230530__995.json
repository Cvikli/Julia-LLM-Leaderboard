Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here is an example of how you could create a function `add_yearmonth` to do this:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    # Convert the 'dt' column to a datetime object\n    df['dt'] = pd.to_datetime(df['dt'])\n    \n    # Extract the year and month from the datetime object\n    y = df['dt'].dt.year\n    m = df['dt'].dt.month\n    \n    # Concatenate the year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df['ym'] = f\"{y}{m}\"\n    \n    return df\n```\nYou can then call this function on your DataFrame using `add_yearmonth(df)` and it will create a new column `ym` containing the year and month extracted from the `dt` column.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the `date_split` function from the `pandas` library to split the `dt` column into a list of date components, including the year and month, and then concatenate them as an integer in format \"yyyymm\". Here is an example of how you could do this:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    # Split the 'dt' column into a list of date components\n    y, m = df['dt'].date_split()\n    \n    # Concatenate the year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df['ym'] = f\"{y}{m}\"\n    \n    return df\n```\nBoth of these approaches will give you a new column `ym` containing the year and month extracted from the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[66,393],"elapsed":13.21354775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
