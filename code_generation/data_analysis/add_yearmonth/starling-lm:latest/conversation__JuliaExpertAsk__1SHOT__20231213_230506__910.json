Here's a brief and concise solution to create a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column of a DataFrame:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrames)\n    df[\"ym\"] = String(format(\"yyyymm\", date(df[\"dt\"]).Year, date(df[\"dt\"]).Month))\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `date(df[\"dt\"])` extracts the date component from each entry in the `dt` column.\n* `String(format(\"yyyymm\", ...))` formats the year and month as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n* The resulting string is then assigned to a new column named `ym` in the DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[112,178],"elapsed":6.417890833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
