Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Of course! Here is a possible implementation of the `add_yearmonth` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from DateTimes in 'dt' column\n    yym = df[:dt].map(x -> string(int(x[\"year\"]) + 0, radix=10)...\" \"$x[\"month\"])\n    # Create new column 'ym' with concatenated year and month integers\n    return df %>% mutate(ym=yym)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `df[:dt].map(x -> string(int(x[\"year\"]) + 0, radix=10)...\" \"$x[\"month\"]`: This line extracts the year and month from the `dt` column of the DataFrame using the `map()` function. The `int()` function is used to convert the `DateTime` values in the `dt` column to integers, and the `$` operator is used to extract the year and month components separately. The resulting year and month values are then concatenated together using the ` string()` function, with the radix set to 10 to ensure that the year is represented as a full number (e.g., \"2023\").\n* `return df %>% mutate(ym=yym)`: This line creates a new column called `ym` in the DataFrame using the `mutate()` function. The expression inside the `mutate()` function is the same as the one above, but it is applied to the entire DataFrame instead of just the `dt` column.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[1,370],"elapsed":11.880921458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
