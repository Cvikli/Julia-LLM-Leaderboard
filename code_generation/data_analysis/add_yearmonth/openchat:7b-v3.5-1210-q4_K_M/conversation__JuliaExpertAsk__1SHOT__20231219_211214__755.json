Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a brief and concise solution to create a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column of a DataFrame:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = String(replace(df[:dt].year, \"YYYY\"), \"MM\")\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `String(x)` converts the `x` variable to a string.\n* `replace(x, old, new)` replaces all occurrences of `old` in `x` with `new`. In this case, we are replacing the `YYYY` part of the date with the year alone, and the `MM` part with the month alone.\n* `String.format(\"yyyymm\")` formats the year and month as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nNote: This function assumes that the `dt` column contains DateTimes in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. If your dates are in a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[112,239],"elapsed":8.392772542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
