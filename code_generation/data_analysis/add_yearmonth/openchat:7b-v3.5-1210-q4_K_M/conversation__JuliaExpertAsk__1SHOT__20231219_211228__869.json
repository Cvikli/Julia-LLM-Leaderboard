Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a concise and efficient solution to create a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column of a DataFrame:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, dt::AbstractString)\n    yyyymm = StringSplit(dt, \" \")[]\n    df |>Column(\"ym\", Int64, yyyymm)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `StringSplit` is a built-in function that splits a string into an array of substrings. We use it to split the `dt` column into its year and month parts.\n* `Int64` is the data type of the new column `ym`.\n* The pipeline operator `|>` is used to apply the function to the DataFrame in place, without creating a new DataFrame.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the `dt` column contains DateTimes in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\". If your dates are in a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,232],"elapsed":7.376541459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
