Here's the solution to the task using the given data:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df) = df %>%\n    mutate(ym = substr(dt, 9, 7))\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. `mutate()` is used to create a new column called `ym` in the original DataFrame `df`.\n2. `substr()` is used to extract the year and month from the `dt` column. The substring starts from the 9th character (the hour component) and ends at the 7th character (the month component).\n3. The resulting year and month are concatenated as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nWith the given data, the output of `add_yearmonth(df)` would be:\n```julia\ndf %>% add_yearmonth()\n# Output:\n#         dt      ym\n# 1 2020-05-24 202015\n# 2 2021-01-15 202115\n# 3 2022-12-05 202265\n```\nNote that if the `dt` column contains non-DateTimes, the function will throw an error.","status":200,"tokens":[1,289],"elapsed":9.713349458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
