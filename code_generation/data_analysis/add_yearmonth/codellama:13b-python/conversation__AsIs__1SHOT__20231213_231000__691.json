Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a possible implementation of the `add_yearmonth` function:\n```python\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    y = df['dt'].dt.year\n    m = df['dt'].dt.month\n    \n    # Concat year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df['ym'] = f\"{y}{m}\"\n    \n    return df\n```\nLet me explain how this code works:\n\n1. `df['dt'].dt.year`: This line extracts the year from each `dt` value using the `.dt` accessor. The `.dt` accessor returns a pandas Timestamp object, which has a `year` attribute that we can use to get the year of each date.\n2. `m = df['dt'].dt.month`: This line extracts the month from each `dt` value using the `.dt` accessor. The `.dt` accessor returns a pandas Timestamp object, which has a `month` attribute that we can use to get the month of each date.\n3. `df['ym'] = f\"{y}{m}\": This line creates a new column called `ym` by concatenating the year and month values using the format string \"yyyymm\". The `f\"{y}{m}\"` syntax creates a string that represents the year and month as an integer, separated by a space.\n4. `return df`: This line returns the modified DataFrame `df`.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it on your DataFrame like this:\n```python\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column called `ym` in your DataFrame, containing the year and month values concatenated as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[66,414],"elapsed":13.973995041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
