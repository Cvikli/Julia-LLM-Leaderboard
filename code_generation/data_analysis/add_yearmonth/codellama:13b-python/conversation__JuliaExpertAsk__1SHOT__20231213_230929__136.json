Here is a brief and concise solution to create a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\":\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, dt::AbstractColumn)\n    df[:ym] = convert(Int64, split(string(df[dt]), \"-\")[1])\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `convert(Int64, ...)` converts the year and month values to integers.\n* `split(string(df[dt]), \"-\")` splits the date time column `dt` into a year-month string (\"yyyymm\").\n* `[1]` extracts the year and month components from the split string.\n\nNow, you can apply this function to your DataFrame `df` using the following line of code:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df, dt)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,215],"elapsed":7.671152042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
