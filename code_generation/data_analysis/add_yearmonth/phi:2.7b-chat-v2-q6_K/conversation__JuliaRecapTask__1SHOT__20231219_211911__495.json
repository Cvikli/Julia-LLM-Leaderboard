X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Based on the given guidelines and special instructions, here are the steps I will follow:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* Extracting year and month from a DateTime column using `DateISO` package: `df['ym'] = Date ISO(df['dt'])[:year, :month]`\n\t* Concatenating year and month as an integer in the format “yyyymm”: `ym = string(df['ym'])`\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df` by extracting year and month from the `dt` column using `DateISO` package, as shown above.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the new column `ym` contains the extracted year and month values in the format “yyyymm”.\n\nHere's the complete code for the function `add_yearmonth`:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Step 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n    DateISO = Base.PackageManagement.load(\"DateISO\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Solve the task\n    df[\"ym\"] = DateISO(df[\"dt\"])[:year, :month]\n    \n    # Step 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n    @assert length(df[\"ym\"]) == size(df, 1) \"Length of 'ym' column should be equal to number of rows in 'df'\"\nend\n```\nNote that I have used the `Base.PackageManagement.load()` function to load the `DateISO` package, as it is a standard Julia library and not a new package. Also, I have used the `@assert` macro to ensure that the length of the `ym` column is equal to the number of rows in the DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[1,433],"elapsed":15.551099458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
