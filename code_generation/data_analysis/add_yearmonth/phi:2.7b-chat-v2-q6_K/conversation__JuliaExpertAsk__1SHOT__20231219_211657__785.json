Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a brief and concise solution to create a function `add_yearmonth` that does what you described:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Vector{Int64}(dt -> year(dt) .+ month(dt))\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `df` is the input DataFrame.\n* `Vector{Int64}` creates a new column of integers with the same type as `dt`.\n* `year(dt) .+ month(dt)` extracts the year and month from each `dt` value, adds them together, and returns an integer result. The `.+` operator performs addition between the year and month values.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[1,181],"elapsed":5.7120175,"_type":"aimessage"}]
