The project has three stages, each stage has different requirements:\n\n1. Stage 1 requires all patients’ data to be added with an extra column `ym` (Year Month), which is calculated by adding year and month as two-digit integers together without concatenation. \n2. Stage 2 requires the `ym` column of all patient's data to be converted into a string, then it should be sorted in ascending order. \n3. Stage 3 needs the sorted list of strings from stage 2 to be stored as comma-separated values (CSV) file named \"patient_data.csv\".\n\nYou are given a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes, where some patient's data is missing and need to fill in before proceeding with the stages.\n\nQuestion: \nBased on this scenario, what would be the order of operations (stages) you should follow?\n\n\nFirst, you need to add year and month as two-digit integers together without concatenation to form `ym`. So, it is Stage 1 requirement. You can use Python's inbuilt `dt.year` & `dt.month` function on DataFrame for this task.\n\nOnce the year and month are added into `ym`, you need to convert the `ym` column from string back to int type before sorting in stage 2. Use `astype(int)` method to convert strings to integers, then use `sort_values()` function on DataFrame for sorting.\n\nThe sorted list of strings from Stage 2 is required for Stage 3. After sorting, the dataframe will be sorted in ascending order and you can simply write the output into a CSV file using `to_csv()` function.\n\nAnswer: \nSo, the order of operations should be as follows: Stage 1 (dt.year + dt.month), then Stage 2 (astype(int)), sort, and finally Stage 3 (to_csv(\"patient_data.csv\")).","status":200,"tokens":[79,491],"elapsed":12.863804709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
