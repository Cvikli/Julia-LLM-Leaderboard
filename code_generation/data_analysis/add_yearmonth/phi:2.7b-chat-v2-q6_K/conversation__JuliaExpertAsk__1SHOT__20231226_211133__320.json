The data has a DateTime column that stores Employee's date of birth (dob). You want to create a new field, `yearmonth`, representing the year and month as integers in format \"yyyymm\". \n\nYou have three columns named 'EmployeeID', 'PerformanceRating' and 'DOB'. The following rules must be considered:\n1. Each employee can only have one dob per row.\n2. The `yearmonth` should not contain any spaces or special characters.\n3. If an employee has been with the company for more than 5 years, their performance rating is automatically rated as 'Excellent'. \n4. If the year and month of the `DOB` column falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the performance rating must be 'Average'.\n5. All other dates should have a performance rating based on their respective years where:\n- Years between 1960 to 1980 are rated 'Good'\n- Years from 1981 to 2000 are rated 'Fair'\n- Any year after 2000 is rated 'Excellent'\n\nQuestion: Given the `EmployeeID`, `PerformanceRating` and `DOB`, write a function that updates the `yearmonth` field with the new format \"yyyymm\". Also, update the `PerformanceRating` to 'Excellent', 'Average', or 'Good' based on the rules above.\n\n\nThe first step is to identify employees who have been with the company for more than 5 years. We can do this by subtracting their current year from the year in their DOB and checking if it's less than 6. For those, we update `PerformanceRating` as 'Excellent'. \n```python\ndf['year'] = df['DOB'].dt.year\ndf['month'] = df['DOB'].dt.month\ndf['dob_int'] = df[['year', 'month']].apply(lambda x: int('{}{}'.format(*x)), axis=1)\ndf['PerformanceRating'] = 'Excellent'\ndf['PerformanceRating'][df['year'] - 1960 <= 5] = 'Average'\n```\nThe next step is to handle the special cases where the year and month of `DOB` column falls on a Saturday or Sunday. We first identify these dates by checking if the day of the week in the month is greater than 4 (which corresponds to a Friday). For those, we update the performance rating to 'Average'.\n```python\ndf['PerformanceRating'][df['month'] > 4] = 'Average'\n```\nLastly, we handle the cases where the year of `DOB` column falls between 1981 and 2000. Here we use proof by exhaustion method to determine if a given year is within this range or not. If it's within this range, we update the performance rating as 'Fair'.\n```python\ndf['PerformanceRating'][df['year'] >= 1981] = 'Fair'\ndf['PerformanceRating'][df['year'] > 2000] = 'Excellent'\n```\nAnswer: The function that does all these steps is `update_performance`. This function takes a DataFrame as an input and returns the updated DataFrame with the new fields.","status":200,"tokens":[116,747],"elapsed":20.204110709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
