It first multiplies the year by 10000, then adds the month value. Finally, it casts the resulting integer as a string and assigns it to the new column `ym`. The function returns the updated DataFrame with the new `ym` column added.","status":200,"tokens":[116,172],"elapsed":4.63228725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
