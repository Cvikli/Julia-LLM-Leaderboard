Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! You can use the `Dates` package in Julia to extract the year and month from the `DateTime` column. Here's an example of how you can write the `add_yearmonth` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, dt_col::Symbol, ym_col::Symbol)\n    df[!, ym_col] = map((x) -> Dates.yearmonth(x).year * 100 + Dates.yearmonth(x).month, df[!, dt_col])\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nYou can call this function by passing your DataFrame `df`, the column `dt` representing DateTimes as a symbol, and the name of the new column `ym` as a symbol. Here's an example usage:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Assuming you already have a DataFrame named `df` with a column named `dt`\n\ndf = add_yearmonth(df, :dt, :ym)\n```\n\nThis will add a new column named `ym` to your DataFrame `df`, which will contain the year and month in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nNote: This code assumes that the `dt` column in your DataFrame is of type `DateTime`. If it's of a different type, you might need to convert it to `DateTime` before using the `add_yearmonth` function.","status":200,"tokens":[75,276],"elapsed":5.990494708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
