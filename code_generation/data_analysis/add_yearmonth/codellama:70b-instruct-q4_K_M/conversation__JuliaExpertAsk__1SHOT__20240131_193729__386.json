Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one possible solution to write the `add_yearmonth` function using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    year_month = map(x -> parse(Int64, string(year(x)) * string(month(x)), base=10), df.dt)\n    return hcat(df, ym = year_month)\nend\n```\n\nThe function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as input and creates a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the DateTime column `dt`. It then concatenates them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1.  We first use the `map` function to iterate over each row of the DataFrame, specifically over the `dt` column. This returns a new vector with the same length as the number of rows in the DataFrame.\n2.  For each element (`x`) in the `dt` column, we extract the year and month using the `year` and `month` functions from Julia's Dates package. We concatenate them together into a string (e.g., \"202106\" for June of 2021).\n3.  We then use `parse(Int64, ...)` to convert this string representation to an integer in base 10.\n4.  The `map` function returns a vector with the transformed values.\n5.  Using `hcat`, we concatenate the new column (`ym`) to the original DataFrame and return it.","status":200,"tokens":[121,362],"elapsed":19.593273281,"_type":"aimessage"}]
