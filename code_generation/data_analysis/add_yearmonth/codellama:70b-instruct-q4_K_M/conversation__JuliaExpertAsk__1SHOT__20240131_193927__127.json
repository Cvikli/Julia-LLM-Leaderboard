It uses the `map` function to iterate over each row in the `dt` column and extracts year and month from it using Julia's built-in date formatting functions. The year is extracted as a 4 digit integer (yyyy) and the month is extracted as a 2 digit integer (mm). The two strings are then concatenated together to form a single string in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, this string is converted to an integer using the `parse` function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,202],"elapsed":10.720117594,"_type":"aimessage"}]
