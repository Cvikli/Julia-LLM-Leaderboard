It returns a new DataFrame with the same columns as the input DataFrame, plus the `ym` column.\n\nHere is the code for `add_yearmonth`:\n```julia\nusing Dates # Importing the necessary package to work with dates and times\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    ym = map(t -> yearmonth(t), df.dt); # Extracting year and month from each DateTime in `dt` column\n    return [df DataFrame(:ym => ym)] # Concatenating the extracted integers with the original DataFrame\nend\n```\nHere is an example of using the `add_yearmonth` function:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nnew_df = add_yearmonth(df) # Apply `add_yearmonth` function to the original DataFrame\nprintln(new_df); # Printing the output for demonstration purposes\n```\nExpected Output:\n```julia\n3×2 DataFrame\n Row │ dt                    ym  \n     │ DateTime              Int64\n─────┼─────────────────────────────\n   1 │ 2020-05-24T00:00:00   20205\n   2 │ 2021-01-15T00:00:00   20211\n   3 │ 2022-12-05T00:00:00   202212\n```\nIn the above example, the `add_yearmonth` function creates a new column `ym` and concatenates year and month from the `dt` column into an integer. The resulting DataFrame (`new_df`) has two columns: `dt` (with original dates) and `ym` (with the formatted integers).\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other ways to achieve the same result.","status":200,"tokens":[0,518],"elapsed":27.821908971,"_type":"aimessage"}]
