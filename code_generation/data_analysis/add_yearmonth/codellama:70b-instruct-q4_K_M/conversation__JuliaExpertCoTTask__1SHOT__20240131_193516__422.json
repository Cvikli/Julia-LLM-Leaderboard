Think through your approach step by step:\n    - Define the task to extract year and month from `dt` column in DataFrame `df`.\n    - Create a function `add_yearmonth` that takes `df` as an argument.\n    - Extract the year and month from each element of `dt` column using `Dates.year()` and `Dates.month()`.\n    - Concatenate them together into one integer, in format \"yyyymm\".\n    - Create a new column `ym` with the concatenated values.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia-repl\nusing Dates\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    years = Dates.year.(df[:, :dt])\n    months = Dates.month.(df[:, :dt])\n    ym = [100*y + m for (y, m) in zip(years, months)]\n    df[:, :ym] = ym\n    return df\nend\n```\n3. Solve the task:\n    - Call `add_yearmonth` with DataFrame `df`.\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n    - Verify the output DataFrame by printing it or inspecting its columns.\n5. Finalize and return the modified DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,296],"elapsed":15.814389703,"_type":"aimessage"}]
