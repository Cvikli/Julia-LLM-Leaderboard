It then creates a new integer column `ym`, concatenating the extracted year and month values together using Julia's string interpolation syntax.\n\nCalling `add_yearmonth(df)` will add the computed `ym` column to `df`.\n\nNote that this function assumes you are providing it with a DataFrame that has a datetime column named `:dt`, but you could modify this to make it more flexible or robust if needed.","status":200,"tokens":[0,356],"elapsed":19.055896236,"_type":"aimessage"}]
