Import Pandas library, which is required for working with DataFrames.\n2. Create a new column `ym` using `.apply()` method on an existing column `dt`.\n3. Define a lambda function that extracts year and month from datetime values in `dt` column using the `.year` and `.month` attributes.\n4. Concatenate them together as an integer by converting each component to string type and joining them with empty space separator.\n5. Return this concatenated value for each row of the DataFrame.\n\nHere is a sample implementation:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    df['ym'] = df['dt'].apply(lambda x: int(str(x.year) + str(x.month)))\n    return df\n```\nPlease note that this assumes your DataFrame `df` contains a column named 'dt' with datetime values in it.
