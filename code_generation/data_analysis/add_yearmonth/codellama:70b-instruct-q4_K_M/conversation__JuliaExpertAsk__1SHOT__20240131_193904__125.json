It extracts the year and month from each DateTime value in the `dt` column using the `Dates.year` and `Dates.month` functions, respectively.\nThen it concatenates them together to create new values for the 'ym' column by converting the year-month string to an integer using `parse`. Finally, it creates a new column 'ym' in the DataFrame with the concatenated year-month integers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,272],"elapsed":14.453201454,"_type":"aimessage"}]
