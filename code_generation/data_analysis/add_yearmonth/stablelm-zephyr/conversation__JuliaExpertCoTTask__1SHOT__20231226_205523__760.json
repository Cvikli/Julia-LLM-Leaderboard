Define the function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame as input and adds a new column named 'ym' to the DataFrame.\n2. In the 'ym' column, extract the year and month from the 'dt' column using the `year()` and `month()` functions respectively.\n3. Concatenate these two values together into one string, separated by an underscore ('_'), and store this in the new 'ym' column.\n4. Ensure that your solution is correct by checking if the length of the first row of the DataFrame (assuming there's at least one date) equals 3 (year, month, and '_').\n\nNow let's write the code:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame{DateTime})\n# Check that the input data has at least three elements in dt column\nif length(df.dt[1]) != 3\nthrow(\"Input DataFrame must have at least three rows with a DateTime column\")\nend\n\n# Add a new column 'ym' to the DataFrame\ndf = df[:+year(dt(df.dt))~'_'~month(dt(df.dt))]\nreturn df\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input DataFrame has at least three rows with DateTime values in the 'dt' column. If not, it throws an error. Otherwise, it adds a new column 'ym' to the DataFrame by concatenating the year and month extracted from each DateTime value.","status":200,"tokens":[232,348],"elapsed":9.481929583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
