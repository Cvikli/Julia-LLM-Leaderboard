Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can create the function `add_yearmonth` in Julia as follows:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates \nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = (Year.(df.dt), Month.(df.dt)) .|> x -> 100*x[1].value + x[2]\nend\n```\nIn the function, `Dates` and `DataFrames` modules are imported first. Then a new column `ym` is added to the data frame by extracting year and month from the datetime `dt` using `Year.(df.dt)` and `Month.(df.dt)` respectively. These extracted values are then concatenated as an integer in format \"yyyymm\" using `100*x[1].value + x[2]`, where `x[1].value` is the year and `x[2]` is the month.\n \nNote: This function assumes that there is a column named `dt` in the dataframe containing DateTimes. If your DataFrame has a different column name for datetime, replace `df.dt` with the appropriate column name. Also, make sure to run this code after you have loaded the DataFrames and Dates module by running `using DataFrames, Dates`.","status":200,"tokens":[83,287],"elapsed":50.053579833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
