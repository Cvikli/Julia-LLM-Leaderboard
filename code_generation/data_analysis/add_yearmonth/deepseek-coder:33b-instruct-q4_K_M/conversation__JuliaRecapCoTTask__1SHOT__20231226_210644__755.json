[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

It takes a DataFrame as an argument and creates a new column called `ym` that is created by applying a transformation to each row of the `dt` column. This transformation extracts the year and month from the date time value using the `year` and `month` functions, concatenates them together with no separator (so for example 202012 would represent December 2020), and assigns this new integer to the `ym` column.\n\nIf a user provides any special instructions that should be considered while writing this code, those should be inserted in place of `{{instructions}}`. \n\nPlease note: This function assumes that you have a DataFrame with a column named `dt` containing DateTimes. The output DataFrame will also contain a new column called `ym` which is the year-month concatenation as an integer. If your DataFrame has different names for these columns, adjust the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[412,285],"elapsed":56.809639917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
