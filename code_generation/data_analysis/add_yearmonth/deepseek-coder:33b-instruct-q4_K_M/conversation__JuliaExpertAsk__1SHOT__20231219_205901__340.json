Here's a concise solution to create a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column of a DataFrame:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df) = string(year(df[:dt]) . \"-\" . month(df[:dt]))\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `year(df[:dt\"])` extracts the year from the `dt` column using the `year` function.\n* `month(df[:dt\"])` extracts the month from the `dt` column using the `month` function.\n* `string()` converts the year and month to strings.\n* `-` concatenates the year and month strings together.\n\nNote: The `.` operator is used for column access in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[1,172],"elapsed":5.45589775,"_type":"aimessage"}]
