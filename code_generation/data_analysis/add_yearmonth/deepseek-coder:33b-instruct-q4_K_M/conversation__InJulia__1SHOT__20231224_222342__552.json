Here is how you could implement your function:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[Symbol(\"ym\")] = map(x -> string(year(x), lpad(string(month(x)), 2, \"0\")), df[:dt])\nend\n```\n\nIn this function `add_yearmonth`, we first define a new column in the DataFrame with label 'ym'. We then iterate over each row of the 'dt' column using `map`. For each date time value `x`, we extract the year and month using `year(x)` and `month(x)` respectively. We convert these values to strings, pad the month part with a leading zero if it is less than 10, and concatenate them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\". The result is stored back into the 'ym' column for each row.","status":200,"tokens":[83,229],"elapsed":39.274345792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
