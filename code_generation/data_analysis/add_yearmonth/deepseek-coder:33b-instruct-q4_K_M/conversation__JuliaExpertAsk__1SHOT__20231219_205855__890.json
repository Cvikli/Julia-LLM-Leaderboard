Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a brief and concise solution to create a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `df.dt`:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = DateTime.yearmonth(df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `df.dt` is the column of DateTimes in the DataFrame.\n* `DateTime.yearmonth(dt)` extracts the year and month from each DateTime value in `dt`. The resulting vector is a pair of integers, where the first element represents the year and the second element represents the month.\n* We assign the resulting vector to a new column named `ym` in the original DataFrame using the assignment operator (`=`).\n\nNote that this function assumes that the DateTimes are in the format \"2023-02-20 12:30:00\". If your DateTimes have a different format, you may need to modify the `DateTime.yearmonth()` function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,233],"elapsed":7.412815334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
