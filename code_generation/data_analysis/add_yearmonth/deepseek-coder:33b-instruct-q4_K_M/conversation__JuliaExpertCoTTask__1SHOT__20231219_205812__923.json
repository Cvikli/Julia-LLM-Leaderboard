Let's solve this task using the given approach. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n\t* Identify the problem and the goal of the function `add_yearmonth`\n\t* Understand the input data (`df`) and the desired output\n\t* Plan the function's structure and logic\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\t* Create a new column `ym` in `df` by extracting year and month from `dt` using the `YearMonth` type from the `DateTools` package\n\t* Use the `YearMonth` function to convert the extracted year and month to an integer in the format \"yyyymm\"\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Implement the `add_yearmonth` function using the steps outlined above\n\t* Test the function with sample inputs to ensure it produces correct output\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the function correctly adds the year and month of each `dt` value and formats the result as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\"\n\t* Use additional test cases to ensure the function works as expected for all inputs in the data range\n\nHere's the implementation of the `add_yearmonth` function:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    ym = YearMonth[]\n    for (i, dt) in eachrow(df.dt)\n        y, m = DateTools.YearMonth(dt)\n        push!(ym, $y$m)\n    end\n    # Convert year and month to integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    ym = map(x -> parse(Int, x).zzz, ym)\n    # Add new column with formatted year and month\n    return df %>% set_col(\"ym\", ym)\nend\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[257,444],"elapsed":23.401509667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
