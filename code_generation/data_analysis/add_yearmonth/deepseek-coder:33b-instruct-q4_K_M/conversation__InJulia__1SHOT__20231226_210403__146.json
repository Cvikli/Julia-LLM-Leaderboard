Each value of this column is created by getting the year (`Year(row[:dt])`) and month (`Month(row[:dt])`) from each DateTime in the original column `dt`, converting them to strings, and then concatenating them together with a space between.","status":200,"tokens":[83,191],"elapsed":32.363634333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
