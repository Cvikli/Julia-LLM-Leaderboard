The `:dt` column is assumed to contain DateTime objects, and for each DateTime object `d`, it extracts the year and month using `Dates.format(d, \"yyyymm\")` (which formats the datetime into a string in the format \"yyyymm\") and then concatenates them together to form a single string which is the integer \"yyyymm\".\n\nNote: You should ensure that `df` has column `:dt`, otherwise it will throw an error. This function doesn't check for existence of `:dt` column, so make sure you have the correct DataFrame before applying this function.","status":200,"tokens":[82,224],"elapsed":6.936983333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
