Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"In Julia, you can use the `Dates` package to manipulate dates and times. Here is a simple function that should do what you are asking:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map((d::DateTime)->Year(d)*100 + Month(d), df.dt) |> collect\n    return df\nend\n```\nIn this function, we are applying a mapping operation to each element in the `dt` column. The mapping operation extracts the year and month from the date time and then concatenates them together as an integer. The map function returns a vector of integers representing the desired format. Finally, we need to convert this Vector{Int} back into a DataFrame column using the `collect` function before assigning it to the new column in the DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that the years and months are represented by two-digit numbers with leading zeros for months < 10.\n\nFor example:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(\"2000-01-15\"), DateTime(\"2001-12-31\")])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will output:\n\n```\n|  dt              | ym   |\n|------------------|------|\n| 2000-01-15T00:00:00 | 200001 |\n| 2001-12-31T00:00:00 | 200112 |\n```","status":200,"tokens":[82,360],"elapsed":11.028380042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
