[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, Given a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes. Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can do this by defining a new column in the DataFrame using the `DataFrame` constructor and broadcasting. Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame and dt is your DateTime column\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = [Dates.format(d, \"yyyymm\") for d in df.dt]\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame as input and adds a new column `ym` to the DataFrame with values being strings of year-month combinations (e.g., \"202111\" for November 2021). The use of broadcasting in this case is particularly efficient because it avoids the need to iterate over rows of the DataFrame, thus saving time and memory.","status":200,"tokens":[82,183],"elapsed":5.769608458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
