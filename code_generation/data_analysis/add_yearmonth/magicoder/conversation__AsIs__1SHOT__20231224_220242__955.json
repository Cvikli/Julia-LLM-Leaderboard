Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can use the `.dt` accessor to get the year and month from a `DateTime` column in a DataFrame. Here's how you could implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame and dt is the DateTime column\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    df['ym'] = (df['dt'].dt.strftime('%Y%m')).astype(int)\n    return df\n```\n\nThis function first uses `.dt` to get access to the date component of each `DateTime`, then it uses `.strftime('%Y%m')` to convert this into a string in \"yyyyMM\" format. The resulting series of strings is then converted to integers using `.astype(int)`. \n\nNote that you need to make sure your DataFrame's column `dt` is of `DateTime` type, otherwise this might not work as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[80,207],"elapsed":6.461642708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
