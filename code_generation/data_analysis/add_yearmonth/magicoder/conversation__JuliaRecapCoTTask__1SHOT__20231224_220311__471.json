[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

These are then added together and returned.\n\nHere is how you would use this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[Date(\"2021-04-15\"), Date(\"2022-05-30\"), Date(\"2023-06-18\")])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame with an additional column `:ym` that contains the year and month of each date in the format “yyyymm”. For instance, for the first row of `df`, the value would be 20214 (because 2021 is the year and 4 is the month).","status":200,"tokens":[386,302],"elapsed":11.094482042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
