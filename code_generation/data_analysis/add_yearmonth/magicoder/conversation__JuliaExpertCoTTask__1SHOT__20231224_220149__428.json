This column is composed of the concatenated year and month values from each DateTime object in `dt`, formatted as an integer.\n\nHere's how you can achieve it using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(d -> Dates.format(d, \"y\") * Dates.format(d, \"m\"), df[:dt])\nend\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nIn the above function `add_yearmonth`, we use the map function to go through each DateTime object in `dt` and apply a lambda function that formats the year (`y`) and month (`m`) of the date into a string. These strings are then concatenated together with \"*\", forming an integer representing the year and month combined, which is stored in new column `ym`.\n\nThis function can be used to add the `ym` column to any DataFrame containing DateTime objects. It does not require the DataFrame to already contain a column named `ym`, nor does it modify existing values in that column.","status":200,"tokens":[249,313],"elapsed":16.526221,"_type":"aimessage"}]
