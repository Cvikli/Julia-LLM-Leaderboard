Here is an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2019,3,1), DateTime(2020,4,2), DateTime(2021,5,3)])\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = Int64[]\n    for i in 1:size(df, 1)\n        push!(df[i, :ym], Dates.year(df[i, :dt])*100 + Dates.month(df[i, :dt]))\n    end\n    return df\nend\n\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis code creates a new DataFrame `df` with column `ym` that stores the year and month of each date in format “yyyymm”. \n\nNote: This will work for DateTimes where the year is less than 1000. If you have years greater than or equal to 1000, it might be more appropriate to use a different method to generate the new column.","status":200,"tokens":[122,277],"elapsed":8.694677708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
