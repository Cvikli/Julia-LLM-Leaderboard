Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a concise solution to create a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column and concatenating them as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\":\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = DateTime.((df.dt).year * 1000 + (df.dt).month)\n    return df\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. First, we use the `DateTime` function to extract the year and month from the `dt` column of the DataFrame.\n2. Then, we multiply the year by 1000 (since the year is represented as a number of days) and add the month to get the total number of days since January 1st of that year.\n3. Finally, we assign the resulting integer value to the new column `ym` in the DataFrame.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the `dt` column contains DateTimes represented as Unix timestamps (i.e., seconds since January 1, 1970). If your DateTimes are represented differently, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[112,260],"elapsed":9.175011041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
