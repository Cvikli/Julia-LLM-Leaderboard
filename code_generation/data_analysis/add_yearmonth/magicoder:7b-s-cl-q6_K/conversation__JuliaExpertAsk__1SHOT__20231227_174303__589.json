Here is how you would define your function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(d -> Dates.year(d)*100 + Dates.month(d), df.dt) |> Vector{Int}\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the `dt` column of the input DataFrame and for each DateTime it converts the year into an integer (multiplied by 100) and then adds to that the month converted into an integer. The resulting array is saved in the new `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[122,163],"elapsed":8.876117625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
