[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

The `year` and `month` functions can be used to extract the year and month parts from a DateTime object respectively. These can then be concatenated together into one string as desired.\n\nHere is an example of how you could implement this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> string(Dates.year(x), lpad(month(x), 2, '0')), df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a DataFrame and adds a new column `ym` to it which represents the year and month of each DateTime object in the original `dt` column. The `map` function is used with a anonymous function that extracts the year and month from each DateTime object and then converts them into a string in \"yyyymm\" format.\n\nIf you want to use this function on your DataFrame, simply call it like so:\n```julia\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[386,252],"elapsed":16.223597125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
