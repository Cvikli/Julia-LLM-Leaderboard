This function uses the map function from the DataFrames package, which applies a function (in this case, a anonymous function that converts the datetime to a string with only \"y\" for year and \"m\" for month) to each value in a column.\n\nNote: This function assumes that your DateTime column is named `dt` and your DataFrame is named `df`. If your DateTime column has a different name, or if your DataFrame has a different name, you will need to modify the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[82,223],"elapsed":11.927103167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
