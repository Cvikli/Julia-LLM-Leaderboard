We define a function called `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame as input. Inside the function, it maps over each value in the column `:dt`, extracts the year and month using the `year` and `month` functions from Dates module respectively, concatenates them into an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". This new value is then assigned to a new column `:ym`. The DataFrame with the new column is returned. \n\nAfter defining the function, we create a sample DataFrame and apply the `add_yearmonth` function on it. You can see that the output DataFrame now has an additional column `:ym` containing the year-month values in \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[249,376],"elapsed":20.743478708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
