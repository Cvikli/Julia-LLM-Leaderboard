Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `add_yearmonth` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrames)\n    # Extract year and month from DateTimes in column dt\n    ym = collect(dt .|> Datepart.Year .* Month)\n    # Concat year and month as integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df |> add_column(\"ym\", ym)\nend\n```\nNote: In this implementation, `collect` is used to extract the year and month from each DateTime value in the `dt` column. The `Datepart.Year` and `Month` functions are then applied to the extracted year and month values to compute their combined value as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\". Finally, a new column `ym` is created by concatenating these values using the `|>` pipe operator and the `add_column` function is used to add this new column to the original DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[112,217],"elapsed":7.70954975,"_type":"aimessage"}]
