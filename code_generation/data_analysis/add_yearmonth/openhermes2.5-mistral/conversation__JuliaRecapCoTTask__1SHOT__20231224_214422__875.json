X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - The `DateTime` type in Julia has functions like `Year` and `Month` which can be used to extract year and month respectively from a `DateTime`.\n   \n2. Solve the Task:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    for row in eachrow(df)\n        ym = string(row.dt.Year, padzero(2, row.dt.Month))\n        df[ym] = ym\n    end\n    return df\nend\n```\n   - The function `add_yearmonth` takes a DataFrame as input.\n   - It uses a for loop to iterate over each row of the DataFrame.\n   - For each row, it extracts the year and month from the DateTime column and concatenates them together into a string in the format \"yyyymm\".\n   - Then, it adds this new string column to the DataFrame with the name \"ym\" and returns the modified DataFrame. \n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - The function takes a DataFrame as input.\n   - It correctly extracts year and month from DateTime column of the DataFrame using `row.dt.Year` and `row.dt.Month`.\n   - It converts the year and month into a string in the format \"yyyymm\" and adds this new column to the DataFrame with the name \"ym\".\n   - The function returns the modified DataFrame. \n\nPlease provide the Special Instructions for me to prioritize them over the above guidelines.","status":200,"tokens":[394,373],"elapsed":13.548746084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
