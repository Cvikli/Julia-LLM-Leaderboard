This will convert all DateTime values in `:dt` to strings formatted as \"yyyymm\". We then use the `.|> Int` pipe operator to convert these strings into integers, which we store in the new column `:ym` of the DataFrame `df`.\n\nYou can call this function by passing your DataFrame with DateTime column as argument like so:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(your_dataframe)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[127,190],"elapsed":6.271063,"_type":"aimessage"}]
