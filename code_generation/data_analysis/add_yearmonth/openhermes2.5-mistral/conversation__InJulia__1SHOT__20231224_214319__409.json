The new column is created by extracting year and month from the `dt` column using the built-in `year()` and `month()` functions respectively. Then, these values are concatenated together as strings in the format \"yyyymm\" using string interpolation. The function also includes an additional helper function called `zero_padding()` to ensure that months are always represented with two digits (e.g., 01 for January).","status":200,"tokens":[85,207],"elapsed":6.577932417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
