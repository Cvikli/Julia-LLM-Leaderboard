Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's a function to do just that:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df) = df[:, \"dt\"] .|> DatePartitioner(year = 1, month = 2) .+ 1\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `df[:, \"dt\"]` extracts the \"dt\" column from the DataFrame `df`.\n* `DatePartitioner` is a built-in function that partitions the date column into year and month. The `year = 1` and `month = 2` arguments specify that we want to extract the year and month components of the date, respectively.\n* `.+ 1` adds 1 to the partitioned values to get the desired \"yyyymm\" format.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the date column is in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\". If your dates are in a different format, you may need to modify the `DatePartitioner` arguments accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[112,222],"elapsed":7.887539833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
