The transformation is defined as `(x) -> x.year * 100 + x.month`, which extracts the year and month from the DateTime object and concatenates them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\".\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with the DataFrame `df` as an argument:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df`, containing the year and month extracted from the `dt` column.","status":200,"tokens":[90,220],"elapsed":12.339029375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
