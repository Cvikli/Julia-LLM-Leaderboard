Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Of course! Here is a possible implementation of the `add_yearmonth` function:\n```\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    # Create a new column 'ym' by extracting year and month from 'dt'\n    df['ym'] = df['dt'].str.split('T').str.slice(0, 3).astype(int)\n    return df\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `df['dt'].str.split('T'.split()` splits the `dt` column into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the year and month components of the DateTime.\n* `str.slice(0, 3)` extracts the year and month components from each tuple in the list. The `0` in the slice index refers to the first element of the list (the year), and the `3` refers to the second element of the list (the month).\n* `astype(int)` converts the extracted year and month components to integers.\n\nWith this function, the resulting `ym` column will contain integers in the format \"yyyymm\", where \"yyy\" represents the year and \"mm\" represents the month. For example, if the input `df` contains the following DateTimes:\n```\ndt                                  \n-------\n2023-01-01 12:30:00\n2023-01-02 13:45:00\n2023-01-03 14:56:00\n```\nThe resulting `ym` column will contain the following values:\n```\nym                                  \n-------\n202301 202301 202301\n```\nI hope this helps!
