Here is a brief and concise solution to create a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\":\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, dt::AbstractDateTime)\n    y, m = date(dt).Year, date(dt).Month\n    df <<= Column{Int64}(\"ym\", y * 100 + m)\nend\n```\nNow you can call this function on your `df` DataFrame like this:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df, dt)\n```\nWhere `dt` is a DateTime object. The function will create a new column `ym` in the format \"yyyymm\" containing the year and month extracted from each date time value in `dt`.","status":200,"tokens":[112,188],"elapsed":6.750847917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
