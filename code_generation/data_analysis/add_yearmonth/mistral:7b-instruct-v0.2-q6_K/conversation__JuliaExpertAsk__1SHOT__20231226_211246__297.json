The piped expressions inside the `+` operator perform the following steps:\n\n1. Apply `map` to each row in the `dt` column, extracting the year and month using the built-in `year` and `month` functions.\n2. Use a series of piped expressions to convert the month value into an integer string. This involves splitting the month string by the ']' character (which is not present in the original data), taking the first element, converting it to an integer, and then converting that integer back to a string.\n3. Join the year and month integers together as a single string.\n4. Rename the new column to `ym` using the `rename!` function.\n5. Return the updated DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[120,318],"elapsed":17.589619583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
