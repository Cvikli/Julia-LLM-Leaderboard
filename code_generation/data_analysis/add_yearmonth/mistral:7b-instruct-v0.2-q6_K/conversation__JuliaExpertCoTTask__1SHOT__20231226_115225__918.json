Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Extract year and month from each DateTime in `dt` column using the `Year` and `Month` functions from Julia's Dates module.\n   - Concatenate the extracted year and month together as a string, then convert it to an integer.\n   - Create a new column named `ym` in the DataFrame and assign the resulting integers to it.\n\n2.
