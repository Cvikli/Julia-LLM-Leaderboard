Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   - Using DataFrames in Julia\n   - Extracting year and month from a DateTime object\n   - Creating a new column in a DataFrame\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\nFirst, let's assume we have a DataFrame called `df` with a column named `dt`. We can use the following function to add a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from each DateTime object in the `dt` column and concatenating them together as an integer:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = map((dt::DateTime) -> Dates.format(dt, \"yymm\"), df.dt)\nend\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the function:\n\n- The function takes a single argument `df` which is expected to be a DataFrame.\n- We use the `map` function along with an anonymous function to apply the year and month extraction on each DateTime object in the `dt` column and store the results in a new array called `ym`.\n- The anonymous function uses the `Dates.format` function from the Dates library to extract the year and month as two-digit strings (\"yy\" and \"mm\"), respectively, and then concatenate them together using the string format specifier \"yymm\".\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nWe can test our `add_yearmonth` function by creating a simple DataFrame with some DateTime objects and checking if the new column `ym` is correctly extracted from the `dt` column:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates, DataFrames\n\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [DateTime(\"2023-01-15\"), DateTime(\"2022-12-31\")])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\ndisplay(df)\n```\n\nThe expected output should be:\n\n```julia\n4×3 DataFrame\n│ Row │ dt             │ ym    │\n├─────┼─────────────────┼───────┤\n│ 1   │ 2023-01-15T00:00 | 202301 │\n│ 2   │ 2022-12-31T00:00 | 202212 │\n└─────┴─────────────────┴───────┘\n```","status":200,"tokens":[385,608],"elapsed":26.8597265,"_type":"aimessage"}]
