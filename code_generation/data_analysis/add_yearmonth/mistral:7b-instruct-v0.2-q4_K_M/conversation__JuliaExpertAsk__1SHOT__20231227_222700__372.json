The `zero_padleft` function is used to add leading zeros to the month number if it's less than 10.\n- The resulting strings are then parsed back into integers using the `parse` function, so that they can be stored in a new integer column `ym`.\n- Finally, we return the modified DataFrame `df`.","status":200,"tokens":[120,272],"elapsed":11.2880345,"_type":"aimessage"}]
