It uses the `map` function to apply an anonymous function on every element of the `dt` column to extract year and month, concatenate them with zero padding for the month number and create a string. Finally, it converts this string back to a Number type so that it can be stored in the DataFrame as a numeric value.","status":200,"tokens":[120,171],"elapsed":7.440105458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
