The extraction of year and month from `dt` is done using Julia's built-in `Year` and `Month` functions, and the string concatenation is performed using string multiplication and string manipulation. The `transform!` function from the `DataFramesTransformations` package is used to apply the transformation by row. The new column name is defined as `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[120,204],"elapsed":8.628016042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
