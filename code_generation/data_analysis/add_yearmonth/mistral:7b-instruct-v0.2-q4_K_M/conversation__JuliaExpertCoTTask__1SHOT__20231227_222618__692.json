Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Extract year and month from each DateTime object using the `year()` and `month()` functions.\n   - Concatenate the extracted year and month with a separator (\"\") to form the desired yyyymm format.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n  df[:ym] = map(x -> string(Int64(x.year)), df.dt) .|> x -> string(Int64(x.year)) * string(\"\") * string(Int64(x.month))\nend\n```\n\n3.

You can check the output by printing the DataFrame using `display(df)`.","status":200,"tokens":[247,281],"elapsed":12.484761833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
