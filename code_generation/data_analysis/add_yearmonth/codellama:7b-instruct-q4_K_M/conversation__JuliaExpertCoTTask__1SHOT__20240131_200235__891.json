We use the `Dates` package to manipulate dates and times.\n2. We define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a `DataFrame` as input and adds a new column `ym`.\n3. Inside the function, we loop over each row in the `df` using the `.[]` syntax, extracting the year and month from the `dt` column using the `year()` and `month()` functions from `Dates`.\n4. We concatenate the extracted year and month into a single string using the `string()` function.\n5. Finally, we assign the resulting array of strings to the new column `ym` in the original `df`.\n6. We return the modified `df` at the end of the function.\n\nNote: The `.[]` syntax is used to access columns and rows in a `DataFrame`, and it is equivalent to using the `[:, :]` syntax.","status":200,"tokens":[0,298],"elapsed":2.460826659,"_type":"aimessage"}]
