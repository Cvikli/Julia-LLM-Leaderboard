We define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a `DataFrame` object as input and returns nothing (`void`).\n2. Inside the function, we extract the year from each `DateTime` object in the `dt` column using the `.|> Dates.year` operator.\n3. The resulting vector of integers is then converted to a string by calling the `string` function on it.\n4. The resulting string is then parsed as an integer using the `parse(Int, x)` function.\n5. Finally, we assign this new column of integers to the `ym` symbol.\n6. We call the `add_yearmonth` function with the `df` object as input, which adds a new column called `ym` to the DataFrame.\n7. The resulting DataFrame is printed to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[0,254],"elapsed":2.091154514,"_type":"aimessage"}]
