First, we define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a `DataFrame` as input and returns a new `DataFrame` with an additional column `ym`.\n2. Inside the function, we use the `string.(Date.(df[:dt]).year)` and `string.(Date.(df[:dt]).month)` expressions to extract the year and month from the `dt` column of the input `DataFrame`. These expressions create a new column with the extracted years and months as strings.\n3. We then concatenate these two columns using the `.*` operator, which creates a new string column with the year and month separated by a dash.\n4. Finally, we return the modified `DataFrame` with the new `ym` column added to it.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n# Output:\n#   dt                 ym\n# 1 2020-05-24        202005\n# 2 2021-01-15        202101\n# 3 2022-12-05        202212\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,393],"elapsed":3.266367194,"_type":"aimessage"}]
