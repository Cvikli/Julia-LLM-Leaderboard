The extracted year and month are then concatenated together with a separator of \"yyyymm\" and stored in the new column. Finally, the function returns the updated `DataFrame`.\n\nNote: The `lpad` function is used to ensure that the month part of the DateTime is always two digits long. This is necessary because the `yearmonth` function returns a String representation of the year and month without leading zeros for months with fewer than two digits, which would result in incorrect formatting if we simply concatenated them together as integers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":1.821764694,"_type":"aimessage"}]
