Think through the approach:\n   - I will define a function `add_yearmonth` that takes a DataFrame as an argument.\n   - I will extract the year and month from the `dt` column.\n   - I will concatenate the year and month to form a \"yyyymm\" format.\n   - I will create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame with the concatenated year-month values.\n\n2. Write the function and other code needed:\n   - I will use the `Dates` module for handling DateTime objects.\n   - I will use the `year()` and `month()` functions from the `Dates` module to extract the year and month.\n   - I will use string formatting to concatenate the year and month into the desired format.\n   - I will add the new column to the DataFrame.\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - I will apply the function to the provided DataFrame `df`.\n\n4. Check that the solution is correct:\n   - I will verify that the new column `ym` has the correct format and values.\n\nHere is the code implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month, then create the ym column\n    df.ym = [Dates.year(dt)*100 + Dates.month(dt) for dt in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n\n# Provided data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Apply the function to the DataFrame\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\nThis code will add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame `df` with the year and month extracted from the `dt` column and concatenated in the \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[211,385],"elapsed":28.028690917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
