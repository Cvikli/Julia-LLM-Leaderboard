Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Below is an example Python function that does this using the pandas library. The function takes a DataFrame `df` and the column name `dt` as inputs, and appends a new column `ym` with the year and month concatenated as an integer in the \"yyyymm\" format.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df, dt_column):\n    # Ensure that the dt_column is in datetime format\n    df[dt_column] = pd.to_datetime(df[dt_column])\n\n    # Create ym by extracting year and month, then converting to string and concatenating\n    df['ym'] = df[dt_column].dt.year.astype(str) + df[dt_column].dt.month.astype(str).str.zfill(2)\n\n    # Convert the ym column to an integer\n    df['ym'] = df['ym'].astype(int)\n\n    return df\n\n# Example usage:\n# df is your DataFrame with a DateTime column named 'dt'\n# add_yearmonth(df, 'dt')\n\n# After calling add_yearmonth, df will have a new column 'ym' containing the year and month as an integer\n```\n\nThis function first makes sure that the `dt_column` is of the correct datetime type. Then it uses the `dt.year` and `dt.month` accessor followed by `astype(str)` to extract the year and month as strings, concatenates them, and pads the month with a leading zero when necessary using `str.zfill(2)`. Finally, it converts the `ym` column from a string type to an integer type. \n\nMake sure to call the function with your DataFrame `df` and the name of your date column, which in this case is assumed to be `'dt'`.\n\nPlease note that if your `dt` column has NaT (not-a-time) values or any other types that can't be interpreted as a datetime, this function will raise an error, so you should handle those cases according to your application's needs before applying this function.","status":200,"tokens":[72,413],"elapsed":35.241127834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
