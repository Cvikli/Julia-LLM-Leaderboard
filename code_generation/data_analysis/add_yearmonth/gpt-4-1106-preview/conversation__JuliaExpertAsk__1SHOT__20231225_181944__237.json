The `Dates.year()` and `Dates.month()` functions extract the year and month from each DateTime, respectively, and then we use arithmetic to combine them into the format \"yyyymm\" as an integer. The result is stored in the new column `ym`.","status":200,"tokens":[110,172],"elapsed":7.41734725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
