Import the necessary package to handle DataFrames in Julia.\n2. Define the function `add_yearmonth` that accepts a DataFrame.\n3. Extract the year and month for each entry in the `dt` column.\n4. Concatenate the extracted year and month into a single `yyyymm` format integer.\n5. Add this concatenated integer as a new column called `ym` to the DataFrame.\n6. Return the modified DataFrame.\n\n### Write any functions and other code you need\nFirst, I will write the function `add_yearmonth` that will perform the described steps:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = [year(dt) * 100 + month(dt) for dt in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n```\n\n### Solve the task\nNow, we apply the `add_yearmonth` function to the given DataFrame `df`.\n\n```julia\n# Assuming the setup code is already in place from the previous steps\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\n\n### Check that your solution is correct\nThe expected output would be a DataFrame `df` with an added column `ym` which would look like this:\n```\n          dt |      ym\n---------------------------\n 2020-05-24 | 202005\n 2021-01-15 | 202101\n 2022-12-05 | 202212\n```\n\nNow, let's fully implement this in Julia. \n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = [year(dt) * 100 + month(dt) for dt in df.dt]\n    return df\nend\n\n# Apply the function on the provided data\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nRunning this code should yield the DataFrame with the new `ym` column as expected.","status":200,"tokens":[211,477],"elapsed":25.775577041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
