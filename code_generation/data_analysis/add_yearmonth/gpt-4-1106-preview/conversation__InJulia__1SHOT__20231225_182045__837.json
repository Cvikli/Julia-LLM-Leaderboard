Below is a function `add_yearmonth` in Julia that takes a DataFrame with a `DateTime` column named `dt` and adds a new column `ym` with the format “yyyymm” as an integer.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Check if the 'df' has a 'dt' column of type DateTime\n    if haskey(df, :dt) && eltype(df[!, :dt]) <: DateTime\n        # Extract year and month, then concatenate them in the desired format\n        df[!, :ym] = df[!, :dt] |> x -> year.(x) * 100 .+ month.(x)\n    else\n        throw(ErrorException(\"DataFrame must contain a 'dt' column of type DateTime\"))\n    end\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nBefore you can use the `add_yearmonth` function, you must first ensure that `DataFrames.jl` is installed and included with the `using DataFrames` statement.\n\nTo use this function, simply pass your DataFrame with the `DateTime` column `dt` to it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Suppose we have the following DataFrame df with DateTime column 'dt'\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2022, 1, 31), DateTime(2023, 5, 15)])\n\n# Call the function to add the yearmonth column\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Now df will have the new 'ym' column with integers in format \"yyyymm\"\n@show df\n```\n\nPlease note that the code assumes that:\n\n1. You have a properly installed and working Julia environment with the DataFrames package.\n2. The DataFrame `df` specifically has a column named `dt` that contains DateTime objects.\n\nIf `df` does not have a `dt` column, or if the `dt` column is not of type DateTime, the function will raise an error.","status":200,"tokens":[75,403],"elapsed":29.419229583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
