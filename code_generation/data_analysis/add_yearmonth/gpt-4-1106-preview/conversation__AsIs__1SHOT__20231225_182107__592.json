Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! You can achieve this by using the `pandas` library in Python. First, make sure you have pandas installed. If not, you can install it using `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\n\nAfter installing pandas, you can use the following function `add_yearmonth` to create the new column `ym`. The function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and assumes there is a column `dt` that contains datetime objects. It will extract the year and month, concatenate them as a string in the \"yyyymm\" format, and convert that to integers.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    # Convert the 'dt' column to datetime if it's not already\n    df['dt'] = pd.to_datetime(df['dt'])\n\n    # Extract year and month, and combine them into a single integer column 'ym'\n    df['ym'] = df['dt'].dt.year.astype(str) + df['dt'].dt.month.astype(str).str.zfill(2)\n    df['ym'] = df['ym'].astype(int)\n    \n    return df\n\n# Example usage:\n\n# Assuming you have the following DataFrame\n# df = pd.DataFrame({\n#     'dt': pd.to_datetime(['2021-01-15', '2021-02-20', '2022-03-10'])\n# })\n\n# df = add_yearmonth(df)\n# print(df)\n```\n\nThis function will add the new `ym` column to your DataFrame. The `.zfill(2)` method ensures that the month is always two digits by padding a zero if necessary (e.g., '05' for May). After this transformation, your DataFrame will have an extra column with the year and month concatenated as an integer.","status":200,"tokens":[72,364],"elapsed":22.240276833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
