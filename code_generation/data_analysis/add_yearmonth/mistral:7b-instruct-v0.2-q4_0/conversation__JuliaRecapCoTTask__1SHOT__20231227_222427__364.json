[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n   ```julia\n   using DataFrames # for handling DataFrames\n   \n   function add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n       # solution here\n   end\n   ```\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n   ```julia\n   function add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n       df[:ym] = map(x -> string(year(x)) * string(month(x)), df.dt) # Extract year and month from `dt` column, convert them to strings, and concatenate them\n       df\n   end\n   ```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   This function should return a new DataFrame with an additional column `ym`, where each row contains the year and month extracted from the corresponding `dt` value in the original DataFrame.\n\nNote: Instead of using the `map` function, you can also use the `transform` function from the `DataFramesDataOperations` module for more readable code. If the `DataFramesDataOperations` package is not already loaded, add this line at the beginning of your script: `using DataFramesDataOperations`. Then change the implementation to `df[:ym] = transform(df, dt -> string(year(dt)) * string(month(dt)))`.","status":200,"tokens":[387,320],"elapsed":12.482258417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
