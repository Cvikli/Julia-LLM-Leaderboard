Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example of how you could write a function `add_yearmonth` to do this in Julia:\n```\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = DateTime.YearMonth(df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. We use the `DateTime.YearMonth` function to extract the year and month from each date in the `dt` column of the DataFrame. This function takes a `DateTime` object as input and returns an tuple containing the year and month components.\n2. We assign the resulting year and month values to a new column `ym` in the DataFrame using the assignment operator `:=` .\n3. Finally, we return the modified DataFrame `df`.\n\nYou can call this function on your DataFrame `df` to create the new column `ym` containing the year and month values extracted from the `dt` column.\n```\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nNote that the `DateTime.YearMonth` function is a part of the standard library in Julia, so you don't need to import anything to use it.","status":200,"tokens":[1,253],"elapsed":8.080969458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
