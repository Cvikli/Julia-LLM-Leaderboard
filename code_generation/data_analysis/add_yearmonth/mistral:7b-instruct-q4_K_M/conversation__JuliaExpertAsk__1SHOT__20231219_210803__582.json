Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a brief solution to the problem you described:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Int(date(\"$x[dt]\").year * 100 + date(\"$x[dt]\").month), df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `map` function is used to apply a function to each element in the `dt` column.\n* The function takes an element `x` from the `dt` column, and uses the `date` function to extract the year and month from it. The year is converted to an integer by multiplying it by 100, and the month is simply added to the year to get the final \"yyyymm\" value.\n* The resulting values are then assigned to a new column named `ym` in the original DataFrame `df`.\n\nNote that I assumed that the `dt` column contains DateTimes in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\", which is the default format for DateTimes in Julia. If your data has a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[1,265],"elapsed":8.467445708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
