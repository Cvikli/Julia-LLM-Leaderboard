Here's a brief and concise solution to create a function `add_yearmonth` in Julia that does what you described:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = convert(Int, combine(df[:dt], \"yyyymm\"))\n    return df\nend\n```\nHere's a breakdown of how the function works:\n\n1. `convert(Int, combine(df[:dt], \"yyyymm\"))`: This line combines the year and month columns of the DataFrame using the `combine` function, which is a built-in Julia function that concatenates strings. The resulting string is then converted to an integer using the `convert` function.\n2. `return df`: This line returns the modified DataFrame with the new column `ym`.\n\nThat's it! You can call the function on your DataFrame as follows:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nAnd the new column `ym` will contain the year and month concatenated as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[112,246],"elapsed":8.625265375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
