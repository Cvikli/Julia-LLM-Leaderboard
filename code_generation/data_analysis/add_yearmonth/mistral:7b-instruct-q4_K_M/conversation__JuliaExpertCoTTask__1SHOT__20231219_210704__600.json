Here is the function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format \"yyyymm\":\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    ym = collect(dt => DateTime.year(dt).toString() * \"+\" * DateTime.month(dt).toString())\n    # Concat year and month into a single integer column\n    df = dataframe([ym], columns=[:ym])\n    return df\nend\n```\nLet me explain how the function works:\n\n1. `collect(df => dt => ...)` - This line collects the year and month values from the `dt` column of the DataFrame `df`. The ` collect` function is a built-in Julia function that allows us to work with a vector of values while avoiding loops.\n2. `DateTime.year(dt).toString()` - This line extracts the year value from each `dt` value using the `DateTime.year` function, and then converts it to a string using the `ToString` function.\n3. `DateTime.month(dt).toString()` - This line extracts the month value from each `dt` value using the `DateTime.month` function, and then converts it to a string using the `ToString` function.\n4. `*` - This operator is used to concatenate the year and month strings together.\n5. `&` - This operator is used to combine the year and month strings into a single integer value.\n6. `DataFrame([ym], columns=[:ym])` - This line creates a new DataFrame with the `ym` column, which contains the concatenated year and month values.\n7. `return df` - This line returns the modified DataFrame `df`.\n\nNow let's test the function using the provided DataFrame `df`:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new DataFrame with the `ym` column containing the concatenated year and month values. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to see more examples!","status":200,"tokens":[239,484],"elapsed":18.680570542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
