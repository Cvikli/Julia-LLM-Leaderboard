Here is a function `add_yearmonth` that does what you described:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, column::String=\"ym\")\n    # Extract year and month from DateTimes in 'dt' column\n    yys = convert(Vector{Int64}, df[:dt].yymm)\n    # Concatenate year and month as integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df[column] = yys\n    return df\nend\n```\nYou can use this function by calling it with the name of the column you want to add, like this:\n```julia\n# Example usage\ndf = DataFrame([Date(\"2023-01-01\"), Date(\"2023-02-02\"), Date(\"2023-03-03\")], columns=[\"dt\"])\nadd_yearmonth(df, \"ym\")\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` in the DataFrame `df` containing the year and month extracted from the `dt` column. The resulting column will be an integer in format \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[112,256],"elapsed":9.145979667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
