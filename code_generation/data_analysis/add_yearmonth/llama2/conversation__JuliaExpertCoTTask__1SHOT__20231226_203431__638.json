Let's solve this task using the given approach. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nStep 1: Think through my approach step by step\n\n* Extract year and month from `dt` column using `DateTime` functions\n* Concatenate year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n\nStep 2: Write any functions and other code I need\n\n* Create a function `add_yearmonth` that takes `df` as input and returns the new `ym` column\n\n Step 3: Solve the task\n\n* Use the `add_yearmonth` function to add the year and month columns to `df`\n\nStep 4: Check that my solution is correct\n\n* Verify that the `ym` column contains the expected values \"yyyymm\" for each `dt` value in `df`\n\nWith that said, here is the code I will use to solve this task:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    ym = DateTime.YearMonth(df[:dt])\n    \n    # Concatenate year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df[\"ym\"] = string(ym)...\nend\n\n# Add the year and month columns to df\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nBy following these steps, I am confident that I can successfully solve this task using the Julia language. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[1,339],"elapsed":11.557580875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
