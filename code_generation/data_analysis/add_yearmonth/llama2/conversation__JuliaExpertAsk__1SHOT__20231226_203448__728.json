Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is a possible implementation of the `add_yearmonth` function:\n```\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame, column::String=\"ym\")\n    df[column] = map(x -> string(year(x), month(x)), df.dt)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `map(f, x)` is a vectorized version of the `apply` function that applies the function `f` to each element `x` in the input data. In this case, we're applying the function `string(year(x), month(x))` to each `dt` value in the input DataFrame.\n* The `year(x)` and `month(x)` functions are used to extract the year and month components from the `dt` column, respectively. These functions return an integer representing the year and month components.\n* The `string` function is used to concatenate the year and month integers together in the format \"yyyymm\". This produces a new column in the DataFrame containing the desired output.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it on your input DataFrame, passing in the name of the column you want to add as an argument:\n```\nadd_yearmonth(df) # creates a new column named \"ym\" with year and month concatenated\n```","status":200,"tokens":[1,289],"elapsed":9.344182208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
