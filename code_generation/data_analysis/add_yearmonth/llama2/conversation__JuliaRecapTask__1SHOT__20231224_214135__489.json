[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Let's solve the task using a systematic approach. Here are the steps we will follow:\n\nStep 1: Recall useful Julia snippets\n\nWe can use the `DateTime` type to extract the year and month from the `dt` column. Here's an example of how to do this:\n```julia\nusing DateTime\n\n# Extract year and month from dt column\ndf[\"ym\"] = DateTime(\"dt\").year * 100 + DateTime(\"dt\").month\n```\nStep 2: Solve the task\n\nNow, let's write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by concatenating the year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\". Here's the code:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df[\"ym\"] = DateTime(\"dt\").year * 100 + DateTime(\"dt\").month\n    return df\nend\n```\nStep 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nTo double-check our solution, let's run a quick test to make sure the `ym` column is being created correctly. Here's an example of how to do this:\n```julia\n# Test the add_yearmonth function\ndf = DataFrame([Date(\"2023-01-01\"), Date(\"2023-02-02\"), Date(\"2023-03-03\")], columns=[\"dt\"])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis should create a `ym` column with the expected values \"300\", \"301\", and \"302\".
