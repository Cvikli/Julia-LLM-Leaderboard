Here's a brief and concise solution to the problem you described:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = DateUtilities. yearmonth(df[:dt])\n    return df\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `DateUtilities` is a built-in module in Julia that provides various functions for working with dates and times.\n* `yearmonth(dt)` returns the year and month of the date in the `dt` column as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n* We assign the result to a new column named `ym` in the `df`.\n\nThat's it! This function will extract the year and month from the `dt` column and create a new column `ym` with the desired format.","status":200,"tokens":[112,181],"elapsed":6.615634625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
