Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Of course! Here is a simple function you can use in Julia to create the new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column of your DataFrame:\n```\n# Function to create new column 'ym' by extracting year and month from 'dt' column\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from 'dt' column\n    y = df[:dt] .> :year\n    m = df[:dt] .> :month\n    \n    # Concat year and month as an integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df[:ym] = string(y) * string(m)\n    return df\nend\n```\nYou can call this function by assigning it to a variable, then passing the DataFrame as an argument to the function. For example:\n```\n# Create new column 'ym' for the given DataFrame\ndf_with_ym = add_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThe `>` operator in Julia is used to perform a logical comparison between the values in the `dt` column and the different components of the date. In this case, we use `.>` to extract the year and month from the `dt` column, which are then converted to integers using the `string()` function. The resulting integer values are then concatenated together using the `*` operator to create the new column `ym`.\n\nI hope this helps!
