X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Based on the provided information, here are the steps I will follow to solve the task:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* `DateTime` type\n\t* `extract()` function\n\t* `concatenate()` function\n\t* `format()` function\n2. Solve the Task:\n\t* Create a new column `ym` by using `extract()` to extract the year and month from the `dt` column, then concatenate them together using `concatenate()`.\n\t* Use `format()` to specify the desired format of the resulting string.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the new column `ym` contains the correct information by checking a sample row or two.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to implement the `add_yearmonth()` function:\n```julia\n# Load the DataFrame\ndf = load(\"data.csv\")\n\n# Create a new column ym by extracting year and month from dt\ndf[\"ym\"] = extract(df[\"dt\"], \"yymm\") .* 100\n\n# Double-check that the solution is correct\nprintln(df)\n```\nIn this code, we first load the DataFrame using the `load()` function. Then, we create a new column `ym` by using `extract()` to extract the year and month from the `dt` column, and then multiplying them together to get the desired format of \"yyyymm\". Finally, we double-check that the solution is correct by printing the entire DataFrame.\n\nI hope this helps!
