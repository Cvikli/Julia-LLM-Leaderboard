Note that `yearmonth` returns a `DatePeriod` object, so we don't need to concatenate the year and month together explicitly - the `DatePeriod` object will be automatically converted to an integer in the desired format when it's added as a column to the dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[80,173],"elapsed":2.392602167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
