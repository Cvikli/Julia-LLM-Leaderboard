Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, here's a function that does what you described:\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = Dates.yearmonth(df.dt) |> Dates.format\"yymm\" |> Int\n    return df\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* We use the `Dates` module to work with dates and times.\n* The `yearmonth` function extracts the year and month from a datetime object and returns a `Date` object with the year and month.\n* We then format the yearmonth object as a string with the format \"yymm\" using the `format` function.\n* Finally, we convert the string to an integer using the `Int` function.\n* The resulting integer is added as a new column `ym` to the `df` DataFrame.\n\nNote: This function modifies the input DataFrame `df` in place and returns it. If you want to keep the original DataFrame unmodified, you can create a copy of it before calling this function.","status":200,"tokens":[122,241],"elapsed":4.15220475,"_type":"aimessage"}]
