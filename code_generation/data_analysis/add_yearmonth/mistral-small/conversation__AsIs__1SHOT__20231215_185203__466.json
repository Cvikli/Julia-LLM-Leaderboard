Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example function that does what you're asking for using the pandas library in Python:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    \"\"\"\n    Add a new column `ym` to the DataFrame `df` by extracting year and month from `dt`\n    and concatenating them together as an integer in format: \"yyyymm\".\n    \"\"\"\n    df['ym'] = df['dt'].dt.strftime('%Y%m').astype(int)\n    return df\n```\nThis function takes a pandas DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `ym` to it. The `ym` column is created by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column using the `dt.strftime` method to format the date as a string in the format \"yyyymm\", and then converting it to an integer using the `astype` method.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'dt': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', end='2022-12-31')})\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\nprint(df.head())\n```\nThis will output:\n```css\n        dt   ym\n0 2022-01-01  202201\n1 2022-01-02  202201\n2 2022-01-03  202201\n3 2022-01-04  202201\n4 2022-01-05  202201\n```\nAs you can see, the `ym` column contains the year and month of each date in the `dt` column, concatenated together as an integer.","status":200,"tokens":[78,456],"elapsed":6.008413958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
