Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Python function that uses pandas, a powerful data manipulation library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    # Ensure dt column is of datetime type\n    df['dt'] = pd.to_datetime(df['dt'])\n    \n    # Create new column ym by extracting year and month from dt, and concatenating them\n    df['ym'] = df['dt'].dt.year.astype(str) + df['dt'].dt.month.astype(str).str.zfill(2)\n    \n    return df\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input, and modifies it by adding a new column `ym`. The `ym` column is created by first extracting the year and month from the `dt` column using the `.dt.year` and `.dt.month` accessors respectively. These are then cast to strings and concatenated together. The month is formatted as a two-digit number with leading zeroes (if needed) by using the `.str.zfill(2)` method. \n\nLet's say you have a DataFrame `df` like this:\n```python\n       dt\n0 2021-01-15\n1 2022-12-31\n2 2020-07-04\n```\nAfter applying `add_yearmonth(df)`, you will get:\n```python\n        dt      ym\n0 2021-01-15  202101\n1 2022-12-31  202212\n2 2020-07-04  202007\n```","status":200,"tokens":[91,393],"elapsed":50.809133958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
