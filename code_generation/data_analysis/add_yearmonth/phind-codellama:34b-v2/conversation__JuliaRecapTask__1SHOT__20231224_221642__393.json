[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

For each row, it extracts the year and month from `dt`, converts them to strings and concatenates them together. The year is converted to a 2-digit string starting from the 3rd character (this way we drop the first two digits if the year is in the range 0-99), while the month is left-padded with zeros to ensure it always has 2 digits.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```julia\ndf = DataFrame(dt = [\"2023-04-15\", \"2022-12-18\"])\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will return a new DataFrame with an additional `ym` column, like so:\n\n| Row | dt          | ym    |\n|-----|-------------|-------|\n| 1   | 2023-04-15  | 202304 |\n| 2   | 2022-12-18  | 202212 |","status":200,"tokens":[394,432],"elapsed":63.947096958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
