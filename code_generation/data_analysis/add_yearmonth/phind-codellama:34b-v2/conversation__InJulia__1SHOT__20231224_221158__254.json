It does so by converting the `dt` values of the dataframe from DateTime format to a floating point number representing the date in years and months (taking into account that a month is considered as 30 days).\n\nPlease note: This conversion assumes a constant length of 30 days for every month, which might not be accurate since some months have 31 days. If accuracy based on actual days in every month is required, then it would be better to extract year and month separately and then combine them into the required format.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nusing Dates\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(x -> Dates.Year(x).value * 100 + Dates.Month(x).value, df.dt) # convert DateTime to yyyymm format\n    return df\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[93,297],"elapsed":38.655637292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
