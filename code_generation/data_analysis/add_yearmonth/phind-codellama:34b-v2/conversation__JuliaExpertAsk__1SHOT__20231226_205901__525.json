Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function that achieves this:\n\n```julia\nusing Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth(df)\n    df.ym = map(x -> parse(Int, string(Dates.Year(x).value), pad=2)*100 + Dates.Month(x).value, df.dt)\n    return df\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` as input and adds a new column `:ym` to it. The new column is computed by mapping over the `:dt` column, extracting the year and month from each DateTime value, padding the year to two digits, multiplying the year by 100 and adding the month to get a \"yyyymm\" format integer. The modified DataFrame with the new column is then returned.\n\nFor example:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\ndt = [Date(\"2021-05-31\"), Date(\"2022-06-30\"), Date(\"2023-07-31\")]\ndf = DataFrame(dt = dt)\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new DataFrame with an additional `:ym` column containing the integers 202105, 202206, and 202307.","status":200,"tokens":[133,297],"elapsed":39.963795584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
