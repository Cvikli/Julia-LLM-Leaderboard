Here's an example of how you could write a function `add_yearmonth` to create a new column `ym` by extracting the year and month from the `dt` column and concatenating them together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\":\n```\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    y = df['dt'].year\n    m = df['dt'].month\n    \n    # Create new column 'ym' with concatenated year and month values\n    df['ym'] = f\"{y}{m}\"\n    \n    return df\n```\nYou can then apply this function to your DataFrame using the `add_yearmonth` method:\n```\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"your_data.csv\")\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n```\nThis will create a new column `ym` in your DataFrame with the extracted year and month values concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `dt.strftime` method to convert the `dt` column to a string in the format \"yyyymm\" and then use the `split` method to extract the year and month:\n```\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    # Extract year and month from dt column\n    y = df['dt'].strftime(\"%Y\").astype(int)\n    m = df['dt'].strftime(\"%m\").astype(int)\n    \n    # Create new column 'ym' with concatenated year and month values\n    df['ym'] = f\"{y}{m}\"\n    \n    return df\n```\nBoth of these methods should give you the desired result of creating a new column `ym` with the extracted year and month values concatenated together as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\".
