Here is my solution to the task:\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    # Extract year and month from datetime column\n    ym = map(x -> DateTime.year(x) * 100 + DateTime.month(x), df.dt)\n    # Create new column with concatenated year and month as integer in format \"yyyymm\"\n    df[:ym] = ym\n    return df\nend\n\n# Test the function with some example data\ndf_example = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2015, 7, 20), DateTime(2016, 3, 15), DateTime(2017, 12, 5)])\nadd_yearmonth(df_example)\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. First, we extract the year and month from the `dt` column of the DataFrame using the `map()` function. The `map()` function applies a function to each element in the input sequence, in this case, the datetime values in the `dt` column. The function inside `map()` is `x -> DateTime.year(x) * 100 + DateTime.month(x)`. This function first extracts the year and month from the datetime value using the `DateTime.year()` and `DateTime.month()` functions, then multiplies the year by 100 and adds it to the month.\n2. Next, we create a new column called `ym` in the DataFrame using the `[:ym]` syntax. This creates a new column in the DataFrame with the concatenated year and month values as integers in the format \"yyyymm\".\n3. Finally, we return the modified DataFrame using the `return` statement.\n\nThat's it!
