Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Python solution using the pandas library. This function assumes that the column `dt` in your DataFrame `df` contains datetime objects.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    df['ym'] = df['dt'].apply(lambda x: int(str(x.year)+'{:02d}'.format(x.month)))\n    return df\n```\n\nThis function uses the `.apply()` method to apply a lambda function to every element in the 'dt' column. This lambda function extracts the year and month from each datetime object (as integer values), converts them to strings, and concatenates them together. The resulting string is then converted back to an integer and stored in the 'ym' column.\n\nNote: The '{:02d}' in the lambda function is a formatting trick that ensures the month is represented as a two-digit number (padding with zeros if necessary).","status":200,"tokens":[91,204],"elapsed":27.300233,"_type":"aimessage"}]
