[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

We'll use the `Dates` module to extract the year and month from the DateTimes.\n\nHere is a function that meets these requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction add_yearmonth!(df::DataFrame)\n    df[:ym] = map(row -> string(Dates.year(row[:dt])), eachrow(df)) .* \n               map(row -> lpad(string(Dates.month(row[:dt])), 2, '0'), eachrow(df))\nend\n```\nThis function modifies the input DataFrame `df` by adding a new column `:ym`. The new column is created by mapping over each row of the dataframe, extracting the year and month from the DateTime in column `:dt`, converting them to strings, and concatenating with string interpolation. \n\nThe `lpad` function is used to ensure that the month is represented as a two-digit number, padding with zeros if necessary.\n\nYou can then call this function on your dataframe like so:\n```julia\nadd_yearmonth!(df)\n```\nThis will add a new column `:ym` to `df` with the year and month concatenated in \"yyyymm\" format.","status":200,"tokens":[397,305],"elapsed":47.391267667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
