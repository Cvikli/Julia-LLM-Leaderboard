Write a function `add_yearmonth` that creates a new column `ym` by extracting year and month from `dt` and concatenating them together as an integer in format: “yyyymm”.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I'd be happy to help you write a function to add a new column `ym` to your DataFrame, `df`, that represents the year and month extracted from the `dt` column. Here is an example of how you might write this function using the pandas library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef add_yearmonth(df):\n    \"\"\"Adds a new column 'ym' to the DataFrame 'df' by extracting year and month from 'dt' column and concatenating them together as an integer in format: 'yyyymm'\"\"\"\n    df['ym'] = df['dt'].dt.strftime('%Y%m').astype(int)\n    return df\n```\n\nThis function takes a single argument, the DataFrame `df`, and returns the modified DataFrame with the new `ym` column added. The function uses the `dt` accessor of the DataFrame's `Series` object to extract the year and month from each datetime in the `dt` column. The `strftime` method is then used to format the extracted year and month as a string in the desired format, and the `astype` method is used to convert the resulting string to an integer for the new `ym` column.\n\nYou can use this function to add the new `ym` column to your DataFrame as follows:\n\n```python\ndf = add_yearmonth(df)\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nThis will return the first few rows of the DataFrame with the new `ym` column added.","status":200,"tokens":[78,345],"elapsed":4.959801958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
