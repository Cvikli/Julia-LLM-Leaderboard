It uses the `map` function to extract year and month from each DateTime in the `dt` column and concatenates them together using string manipulation. Finally, it converts the resulting strings to integers using the `parse` function and assigns the new column to the DataFrame using the `.` notation.","status":200,"tokens":[122,176],"elapsed":1.7359155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
