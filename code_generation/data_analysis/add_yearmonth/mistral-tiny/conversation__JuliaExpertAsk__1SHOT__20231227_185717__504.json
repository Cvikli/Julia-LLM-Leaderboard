The `map` function applies the `year` and `month` functions from the `Dates` module to each element in the `dt` column. Then it concatenates the year and month as strings using `.` as a separator and multiplies the year string with 10 to get the final format: \"yyyymm\".","status":200,"tokens":[122,172],"elapsed":1.617934125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
