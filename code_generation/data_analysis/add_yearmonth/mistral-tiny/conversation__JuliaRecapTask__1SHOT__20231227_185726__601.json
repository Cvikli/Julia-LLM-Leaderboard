[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nGiven a DataFrame `df` with column `dt` representing DateTimes.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - DataFrames: `DataFrame`, `column_add!`\n   - Date and Time manipulation: `DateTime`, `year`, `month`\n\n2. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n  # Extract year and month from dt column and concatenate them together as an integer\n  ym = [year(dt) * 100 + month(dt) for dt in eachrow(df)]\n\n  # Create a new column ym in the DataFrame\n  column_add!(df, :ym, ym)\n\n  return df\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe function `add_yearmonth` accepts a DataFrame as an argument, extracts the year and month from the `dt` column, concatenates them together as an integer, and creates a new column `ym` in the DataFrame with the extracted year-month integers.\n\nI believe this function correctly solves the problem as stated.
