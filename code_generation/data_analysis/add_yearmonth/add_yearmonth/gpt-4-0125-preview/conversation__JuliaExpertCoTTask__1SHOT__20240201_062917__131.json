I'll think through the approach, planning to iterate over the DataFrame to extract the year and month from each `DateTime` object in the `dt` column. Then, I'll format these as an integer in the \"yyyymm\" format.\n2. I will write the required `add_yearmonth` function, which will include steps to create the new column `ym` based on the processed `dt` column datetimes.\n3. After creating the function, I will solve the task using the provided DataFrame `df`.\n4. Finally, I'll verify that the solution adds the new column correctly by checking the DataFrame structure.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Writing the function\nfunction add_yearmonth(df::DataFrame)\n    df.ym = [year(dt)*100 + month(dt) for dt in df.dt]  # Extract year, multiply by 100 and add month\n    return df\nend\n\n# Data provided for solving the task\ndf = DataFrame(dt=[DateTime(2020, 5, 24), DateTime(2021, 1, 15), DateTime(2022, 12, 5)])\n\n# Step 3: Solve the task\nadd_yearmonth(df)\n\n# Step 4: Check the DataFrame to ensure `ym` column is correct\nprintln(df)\n```\n\nIn this solution, we created the function `add_yearmonth` that adds the `ym` column to the DataFrame. We used a comprehension to iterate through each datetime in the `dt` column, extracting the year and month, and concatenating them in the \"yyyymm\" format expressed as an integer. Finally, we tested the function with the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[211,355],"elapsed":31.323771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
