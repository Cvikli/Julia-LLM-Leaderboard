The `map` function is used to iterate over the `dt` column, and string formatting is employed to concatenate the year (padded with leading zeros) and month as integers in the format \"yyyymm\". The resulting DataFrame with the added `ym` column is then returned.","status":200,"tokens":[120,208],"elapsed":4.77038025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
