Then, the function `add_yearmonth` is defined to take a DataFrame `df` as input, and it adds a new column `ym` by iterating through the `dt` column and extracting the year and month from each datetime value. The year and month are concatenated as an integer in the format \"yyyymm\" and added to the new `ym` column.\n\nFinally, the example data `df` is defined, and the `add_yearmonth` function is called on it to create the resulting DataFrame `result_df`. The solution is checked by printing the resulting DataFrame.\n\nThe expected output is:\n\n```\n3×2 DataFrame\n│ Row │ dt                   │ ym   │\n│     │ DateTime             │ String │\n├─────┼──────────────────────┼───────┤\n│ 1   │ 2020-05-24T00:00:00 │ 2005 │\n│ 2   │ 2021-01-15T00:00:00 │ 2101 │\n│ 3   │ 2022-12-05T00:00:00 │ 2212 │\n```","status":200,"tokens":[247,481],"elapsed":18.055841375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
