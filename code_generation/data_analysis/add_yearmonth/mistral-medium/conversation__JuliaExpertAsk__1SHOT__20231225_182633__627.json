It uses the `Dates` library to extract year and month, and then formats the year as a 4-digit string using `string` function with `pad = 4` and `base = 10`. Finally, it concatenates the year and month strings using `*` operator and assigns the result to the new `ym` column.","status":200,"tokens":[120,223],"elapsed":11.004242,"_type":"aimessage"}]
