Here's an implementation of the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped_data = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = mapreduce(x -> length(x.values), +, grouped_data)\n    return Dict(zip(unique(df[!, :model]), counts))\nend\n```\n\nTo use this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame, you can simply call it as follows:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = # Your data here (replace 'Your Data' with the actual data)\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(\"Model counts:\")\nfor (model, count) in counts\n    println(\"$model - $count rows\")\nend\n```\n\nThis will group your `df_cars` DataFrame by the `model` column and calculate how many rows there are for each unique model. The function then returns a dictionary containing the unique models as keys and their respective row counts as values. Finally, it prints out the model counts in the specified format.","status":200,"tokens":[61,264],"elapsed":44.484001084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
