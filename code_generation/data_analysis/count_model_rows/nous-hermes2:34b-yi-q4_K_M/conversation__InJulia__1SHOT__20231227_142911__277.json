Then, it iterates through each group and calculates how many rows there are for each model using the `length()` function. Finally, it stores these counts in a dictionary where the keys represent the models and the values represent the counts of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[61,186],"elapsed":31.665707834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
