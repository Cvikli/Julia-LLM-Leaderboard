Here's how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = Dict()\n\n    for (model, sub_group) in grouped\n        push!(counts, model => length(sub_group))\n    end\n\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nYou can then use this function by passing your DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = # Your DataFrame here (e.g. read from a CSV file or create manually)\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(model_counts)\n```\n\nThis will print a dictionary with each car model as the key and its corresponding number of rows in the `df_cars` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[61,241],"elapsed":41.599762708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
