Here is a possible implementation of the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df.model, df) |> length\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The `groupby` function groups the data in the `df` DataFrame by the values in the `model` column using the `|>` pipe operator.\n* The `length` function returns the number of rows in each group.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with your input DataFrame, like this:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\ndf_cars = read_csv(\"cars.csv\")\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will output the number of rows in each model group for the `df_cars` DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[90,196],"elapsed":6.819693959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
