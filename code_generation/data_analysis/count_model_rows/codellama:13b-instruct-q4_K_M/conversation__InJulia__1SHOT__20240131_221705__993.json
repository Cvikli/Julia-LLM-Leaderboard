Here's an example implementation:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    # Group the data by model\n    grouped_data = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    \n    # Count the number of rows for each group\n    counts = map(x -> length(x), grouped_data)\n    \n    # Return the count for each model\n    return Dict(counts)\nend\n```\nYou can then call this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame as an argument, like this:\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe `result` variable will be a dictionary where the keys are the different models and the values are the number of rows for each model. For example, if your data looked like this:\n```julia\nmodel        price\n---------------\nToyota Camry 10000\nFord Focus   5000\nHonda Civic  8000\nToyota Camry 12000\nFord Focus   7000\n```\nThe `result` dictionary would look like this:\n```julia\n{\n    \"Toyota Camry\" => 2,\n    \"Ford Focus\" => 2,\n    \"Honda Civic\" => 1\n}\n```","status":200,"tokens":[60,355],"elapsed":4.734044141,"_type":"aimessage"}]
