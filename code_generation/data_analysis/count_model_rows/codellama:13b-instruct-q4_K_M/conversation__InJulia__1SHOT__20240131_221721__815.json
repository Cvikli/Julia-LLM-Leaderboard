We then define the function `count_model_rows` that takes in a `DataFrame` as input and returns the number of rows for each unique value of `model` using the `by` function from the `Statistics` package.\n\nThe `by` function is used to group the data by the `model` column and then apply the `nrow` function, which counts the number of rows in each group. The resulting output is a `DataFrame` with columns `model` and `n`, where `n` contains the number of rows for each unique value of `model`.\n\nYou can then call the function on your original data frame to get the desired result:\n```\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will give you a new `DataFrame` with two columns, `model` and `n`, where `n` contains the number of rows for each unique value of `model`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,331],"elapsed":4.344681555,"_type":"aimessage"}]
