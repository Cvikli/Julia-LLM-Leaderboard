Here's an example:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Mercedes\", \"Ford\"], year = [2018, 2019, 2020, 2021])\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return size.(grouped)\nend\n```\nThis function first creates a `DataFrame` with two columns: `model` and `year`. It then defines the `count_model_rows` function, which takes a `DataFrame` as an argument. The function uses the `groupby()` function to group the data by the `model` column, and then uses the `size()` method to get the number of rows in each group. Finally, it returns the result as a vector of integers, where each element corresponds to the number of rows for each model.\n\nYou can call the function like this:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n# Output: [3, 2, 1]\n```\nThis indicates that there are 3 rows for the \"Audi\" model, 2 rows for the \"BMW\" model, and 1 row for the \"Mercedes\" model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":4.44680471,"_type":"aimessage"}]
