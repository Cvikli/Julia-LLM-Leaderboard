In this case, we use `nrow` to count the number of rows in each group.\n* The resulting object is an array where each element corresponds to a row in the original data frame. Each row has two columns: `model` and `count`.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the column `model` contains only unique values. If there are duplicate models, you may need to use another aggregation function such as `sum` or `mean`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":2.722137672,"_type":"aimessage"}]
