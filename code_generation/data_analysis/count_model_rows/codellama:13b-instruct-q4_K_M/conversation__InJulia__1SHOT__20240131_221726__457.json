The resulting dictionary is then converted to a DataFrame with the `collect` and `values` functions, and the name of the column is specified as `\"count\"`. Finally, the resulting DataFrame is returned.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the `combine` function from DataFrames.jl to do the grouping and calculation in one step:\n```\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `nrow` function from Base Julia to calculate the number of rows for each group. The resulting DataFrame is returned without the need to create a new one.","status":200,"tokens":[0,387],"elapsed":5.084678115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
