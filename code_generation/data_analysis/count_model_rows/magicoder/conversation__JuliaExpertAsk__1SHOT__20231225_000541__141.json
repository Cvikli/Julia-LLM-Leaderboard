Then, we create an array with the size of each group (i.e., how many rows there are for each model). This is returned as the output of the function.\n  \nTo use this function you can simply do: \n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nReplace `df_cars` with your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[100,191],"elapsed":6.130967459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
