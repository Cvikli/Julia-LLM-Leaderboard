The `groupby` method is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregation functions. Here, we'll group by 'model' column and then use the `size` function to get the count of each model. \n\nHere is a python solution using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    return df['model'].groupby(df['model']).count()\n\n# Suppose this is your DataFrame\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({'model': ['Audi', 'BMW', 'Mercedes', 'BMW', 'BMW', 'Audi', 'Mercedes']})\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThe function `count_model_rows` will return a Series where the index are unique models and values are counts. \n\nIf you want to get this as a DataFrame, just do:\n```python\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    return df['model'].groupby(df['model']).count().reset_index()\n```\nNow, the result will be a DataFrame with two columns 'model' and 'count'.","status":200,"tokens":[100,281],"elapsed":8.803935417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
