The result is a vector where every element corresponds to a different model and its corresponding count of rows.\n\nYou can call this function like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\"], date=[1,2,3,4], other=[5,6,7,8])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(counts)\n```\nThis will print: `[2, 1]` which means there are 2 rows for model \"A\" and 1 row for model \"B\". The DataFrame `df_cars` should be created with the corresponding data.","status":200,"tokens":[60,267],"elapsed":8.120408833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
