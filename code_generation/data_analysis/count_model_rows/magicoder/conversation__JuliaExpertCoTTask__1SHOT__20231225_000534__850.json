The `combine` function is used to calculate the length of each group which gives us the count of rows for each model. \n\nWhen you run this code with your example DataFrame df_cars, it will return a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model and its corresponding number of rows.","status":200,"tokens":[211,191],"elapsed":6.6234605,"_type":"aimessage"}]
