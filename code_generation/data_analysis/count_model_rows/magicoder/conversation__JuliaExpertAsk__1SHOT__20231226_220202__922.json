This is achieved using the built-in `countmap()` function from DataFrames.jl package, which creates an associative array (i.e., dictionary) that maps the elements to their respective frequency count.\n\nYou can then use this function on your DataFrame like so:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"B\"]) # create a sample dataframe\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(counts)\n```\nThis will output the counts of each model:\n```julia\nDict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:\n  \"A\" => 2\n  \"B\" => 2\n  \"C\" => 1\n```","status":200,"tokens":[100,280],"elapsed":8.756879417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
