The function `count_model_rows` uses the `groupby` function from DataFrames to group data by the `:model` column and then applies the size function to compute the number of elements in each group (in our case, the number of rows). The result is a NamedArray where the first dimension contains the names of the models, and the second dimension contains the corresponding counts. The `.` in `[:,1]` specifies that we are taking only the first column from this array (the counts), hence it returns just an array with the counts for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[60,270],"elapsed":8.190328333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
