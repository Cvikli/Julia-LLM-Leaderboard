Then, to solve the task, we could use the `groupby` function from the `DataFrames.jl` package.\n\nHere is an example of how it might look:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Group by model and get counts\n    return groupby(df, :model).counts[:]\nend\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n\n# Call the function and print results\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nIn this code, `groupby` groups rows in the DataFrame based on unique values of a specified column (in our case, `:model`). The `.counts[:]` at the end then calculates how many times each group occurs. \n\nPlease note that the package `DataFrames` is not included by default in Julia and you need to install it via Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\") command before running this script.","status":200,"tokens":[211,276],"elapsed":14.931994167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
