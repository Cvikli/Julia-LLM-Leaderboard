Here is a possible implementation of the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    # Group data by model\n    groups = groupby(df_cars, df_cars.model)\n    \n    # Calculate number of rows for each model\n    counts = map(groups, length)\n    \n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` `df_cars` as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of rows in each group. The groups are created by grouping the data by the `model` column using the `groupby` function. The `length` function is then applied to each group to calculate the number of rows.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!","status":200,"tokens":[90,186],"elapsed":6.463706416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
