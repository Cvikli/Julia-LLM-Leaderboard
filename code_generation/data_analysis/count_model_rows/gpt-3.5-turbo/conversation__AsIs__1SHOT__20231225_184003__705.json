Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    count_df = df.groupby('model').size().reset_index(name='count')\n    return count_df\n```\n\nIn this function, `groupby('model')` groups the data in the DataFrame `df` by the `model` column. Then, the `size()` function calculates the number of rows in each group. Finally, `reset_index(name='count')` converts the resulting Series into a DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`, which represent the model name and the number of rows for each model, respectively. The function returns this DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function and pass your DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument to get the desired result.","status":200,"tokens":[51,175],"elapsed":3.390043542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
