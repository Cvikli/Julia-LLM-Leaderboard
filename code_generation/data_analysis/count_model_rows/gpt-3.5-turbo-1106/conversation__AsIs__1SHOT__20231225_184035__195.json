Below is an example of how you can write the function `count_model_rows` using Python and pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'model': ['Toyota', 'Toyota', 'Honda', 'Honda', 'Ford']}\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    model_counts = df['model'].value_counts()\n    return model_counts\n\n# Using the function\nmodel_row_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(model_row_counts)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will group the data by the 'model' column and calculate how many rows there are for each model. This will give you the counts of each model in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[51,149],"elapsed":2.115815833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
