You can create a function called `count_model_rows` that uses the `groupby` and `size` functions to achieve this. Here's an example of how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    model_counts = df.groupby('model').size().reset_index(name='count')\n    return model_counts\n```\n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars` to get the count of rows for each model:\n\n```python\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(model_counts)\n```\n\nThis will give you a new DataFrame with the count of rows for each model in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[51,137],"elapsed":3.711124208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
