You can achieve this in Julia using the DataFrame and DataFramesMeta packages. Here's an example of how to write a function `count_model_rows` to achieve this:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing DataFramesMeta\n\n# Define the function to count rows for each model\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    @linq df |>\n        groupby(_.model) |>\n        combine(nrow => :count)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we use the `@linq` macro provided by DataFramesMeta to perform the data manipulation. Within the function, we first group the data by the `model` column and then use the `combine` function to count the number of rows for each group.\n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars` as the argument, like so:\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will give you a new DataFrame `result` that contains the counts of rows for each model in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[54,210],"elapsed":3.711383083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
