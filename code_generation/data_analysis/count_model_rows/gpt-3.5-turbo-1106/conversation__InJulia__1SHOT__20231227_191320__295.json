Here's an example of how you can create the function `count_model_rows`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing StatsBase\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    model_counts = groupby(df, :model) do group\n        DataFrame(model=first(group).model, count=length(group))\n    end\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nIn this example, the `groupby` function is used to group the data in the DataFrame by the `model` column, and then the `length` function is used to calculate the count of rows for each model.\n\nYou can use this function with a DataFrame `df_cars` as follows:\n```julia\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will create a new DataFrame `model_counts` with the count of rows for each model in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[54,193],"elapsed":3.286094083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
