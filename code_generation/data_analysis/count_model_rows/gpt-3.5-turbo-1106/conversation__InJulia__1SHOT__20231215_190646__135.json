Here's an example of how you can write the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    model_counts = combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow)\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we first use the `groupby` function to group the data by the `model` column, and then we use the `combine` function to calculate the number of rows for each group using `nrow`. The result is a new DataFrame `model_counts` containing the model names and the corresponding row counts.\n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars` to get the desired result.","status":200,"tokens":[54,174],"elapsed":4.1987115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
