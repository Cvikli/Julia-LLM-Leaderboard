I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's an example of how you could create a function `count_model_rows` that groups the data in `df_cars` by model and counts the number of rows for each group:\n```\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the counts for each model\n    model_counts = {}\n    \n    # Loop over each model in the DataFrame\n    for model in df_cars.model.unique():\n        # Get the rows for that model\n        model_rows = df_cars[df_cars['model'] == model]\n        \n        # Increment the count for that model by 1\n        model_counts[model] += 1\n        \n    # Return the counts for each model\n    return model_counts\n```\nYou can then call this function by passing in your `df_cars` DataFrame, like this:\n```\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThis will output a dictionary with the counts for each model in `df_cars`. For example:\n```\n{'Toyota': 10, 'Ford': 5, 'Honda': 8}\n```\nI hope this helps!
