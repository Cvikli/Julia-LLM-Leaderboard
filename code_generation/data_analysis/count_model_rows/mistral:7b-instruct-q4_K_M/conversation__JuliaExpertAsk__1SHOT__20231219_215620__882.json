Let me show you how to do this in Julia.\n\nHere's the function you requested:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars) = groupby(df_cars, :model) |> length\n```\nNow, let me explain what's happening here. We're using the `groupby` function to group the data by the `:model` column. The `|>` symbol is used to pipeline the data into the `length` function, which calculates the number of rows for each group.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\ndf_cars = readcsv(\"cars.csv\")\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will output a dictionary with the model as the key and the number of rows for each model as the value.\n\nAnd that's it! Pretty straightforward, right?","status":200,"tokens":[1,207],"elapsed":6.510697625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
