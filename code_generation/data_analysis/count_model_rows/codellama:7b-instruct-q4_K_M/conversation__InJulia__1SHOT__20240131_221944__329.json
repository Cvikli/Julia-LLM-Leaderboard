The `groupby` function is used to group the data by the \"model\" column, and the `map` function is used to apply the `length` function to each group.\n\nYou can then call this function on your DataFrame like this:\n```\nnum_rows_per_group = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will give you a vector of integers where each integer represents the number of rows in the corresponding group.","status":200,"tokens":[0,246],"elapsed":2.004354503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
