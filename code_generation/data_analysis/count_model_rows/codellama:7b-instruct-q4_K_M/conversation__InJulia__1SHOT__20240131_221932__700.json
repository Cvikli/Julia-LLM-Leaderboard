It then creates an array to store the count of rows for each model.\n\nNext, it loops through each model value and uses the `.==` operator to find the rows that match that model. The result is a vector of booleans where `true` indicates a match and `false` indicates no match. The `sum` function is then used to count the number of `true` values in each row, which gives us the count of rows for each model.\n\nFinally, the counts are returned as an array of integers.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":1.975340774,"_type":"aimessage"}]
