Inside the anonymous function passed as an argument to `groupby()`, we use the `length()` function to calculate the number of rows in each group. Finally, the result is converted into a dictionary using `collect(Dict(map(...)))`. The keys and values of the resulting `GroupedDataFrame` are extracted and mapped to create the dictionary where keys represent distinct model names, and their corresponding values contain the count of rows for that particular model.","status":200,"tokens":[106,220],"elapsed":13.476788708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
