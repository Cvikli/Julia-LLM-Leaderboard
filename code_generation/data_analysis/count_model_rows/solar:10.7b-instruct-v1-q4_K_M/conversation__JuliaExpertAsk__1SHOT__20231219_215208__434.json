Here is a possible implementation of the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n```\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame, model::String)\n    return size(filter(df, model))\nend\n```\nHere's how you can use this function:\n```\njulia> df_cars = DataFrame(\"model\" => [\"Toyota\", \"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Honda\", \"Nissan\"],\n                         \"year\" => [2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019])\n\njulia> count_model_rows(df_cars, \"Toyota\")\n3\n```\nThis will return the number of rows in `df_cars` where the value in the `model` column is \"Toyota\".\n\nI hope this helps!
