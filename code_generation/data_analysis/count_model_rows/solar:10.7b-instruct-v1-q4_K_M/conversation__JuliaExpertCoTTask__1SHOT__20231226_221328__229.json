Define a function called `count_model_rows` that receives `df_cars` as an argument.\n2. Use Julia's built-in groupby and size functions to calculate the number of rows for each unique model in `df_cars`.\n3. Return the result.\n\nHere is the function implementation:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    model_counts = groupby(df_cars, :model) do df_grouped_by_model\n        (model = first(df_grouped_by_model[:model]), size(df_grouped_by_model))\n    end\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nNow we'll test the function with our example DataFrame:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis function returns a `Dict` where the keys are unique values in the `model` column, and the values are the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[217,280],"elapsed":26.470323875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
