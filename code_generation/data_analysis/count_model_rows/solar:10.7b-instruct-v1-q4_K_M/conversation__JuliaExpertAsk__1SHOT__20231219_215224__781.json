Here's a brief and concise solution to your question:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame, model::String)\n    return size(filter(df, model))\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* The function takes two arguments: `df` (the DataFrame), and `model` (the column name containing the model information).\n* We use `size()` to calculate the number of rows that match the filter criteria.\n* The `filter()` function is used to select only the rows where the value in the `model` column matches the input `model`.\n\nExample usage:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(\"make => model,year => price\n\"Toyota => Camry,2015 => 25000\nHonda => Civic,2016 => 18000\nNissan => Altima,2017 => 20000\nMazda => Mazda3,2018 => 19000\nKia => Optima,2019 => 17000\")\ncount_model_rows(df_cars, \"Toyota\") # returns 3\ncount_model_rows(df_cars, \"Honda\") # returns 2\n```","status":200,"tokens":[1,303],"elapsed":9.680377417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
