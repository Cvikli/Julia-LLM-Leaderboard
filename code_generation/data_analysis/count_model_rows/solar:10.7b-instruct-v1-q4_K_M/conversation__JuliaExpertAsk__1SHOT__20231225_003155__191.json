It uses Julia's `GroupedDataArrays` to group rows by the column named `model`. The `length()` function is used to calculate the number of rows in each group and returns a dictionary mapping model names with their corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[106,164],"elapsed":10.282141416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
