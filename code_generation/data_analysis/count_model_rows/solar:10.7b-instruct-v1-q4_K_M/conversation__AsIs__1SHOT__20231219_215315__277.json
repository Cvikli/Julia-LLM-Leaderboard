I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's an example of how you could create a function `count_model_rows` to group the data in `df_cars` by model:\n```\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    # Group the data by model\n    grouped_data = df_cars.groupby('model')\n    \n    # Calculate the number of rows for each model\n    num_rows = len(grouped_data)\n    \n    return num_rows\n```\nTo use this function, simply call it and pass in `df_cars` as an argument:\n```\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThis will output the number of rows for each model in `df_cars`.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use the built-in `groupby.size` method to calculate the number of rows for each group:\n```\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    # Group the data by model\n    grouped_data = df_cars.groupby('model')\n    \n    # Calculate the number of rows for each group\n    num_rows = grouped_data.size()\n    \n    return num_rows\n```\nBoth of these approaches will give you the same result, which is the number of rows in `df_cars` for each model.
