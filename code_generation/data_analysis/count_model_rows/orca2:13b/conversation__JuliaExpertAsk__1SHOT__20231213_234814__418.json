Here is a possible implementation of the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Use the `groupby` function to group the data by model\n    counted_rows = df_cars |> groupby(df_cars.model)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of rows for each group\n    num_rows = counted_rows |> length\n    \n    return num_rows\nend\n```\nTo use this function, simply call it and pass in your `DataFrame` object:\n```julia\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\nThis will output the number of rows for each model in the `DataFrame`.","status":200,"tokens":[90,172],"elapsed":5.967853625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
