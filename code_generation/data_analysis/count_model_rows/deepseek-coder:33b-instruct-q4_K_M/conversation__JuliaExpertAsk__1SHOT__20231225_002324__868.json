It returns a Series where the index is the `model` and the values are the counts of rows for that model. \n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\n# create some data\ndata = {\n    'model': ['audi', 'bmw', 'opel', 'bmw', 'audi'],\n}\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame(data)\nprint(df_cars)\n\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(counts)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n    model\n    0   audi\n    1    bmw\n    2   opel\n    3    bmw\n    4   audi\n\n    audi    2\n    bmw     2\n    opel    1\n    Name: model, dtype: int64\n\nThis shows that there are 2 'audi' rows, 2 'bmw' rows and 1 'opel' row in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[101,301],"elapsed":50.977926833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
