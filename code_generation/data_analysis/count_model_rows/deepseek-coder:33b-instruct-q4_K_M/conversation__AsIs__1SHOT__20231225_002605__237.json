This is equivalent to counting how many cars of a particular model we have in our DataFrame. \n\nThe result will be:\n\n```python\nmodel\nAudi       2\nBMW        2\nMercedes   1\ndtype: int64\n```\nThis indicates that there are 2 BMWs, 2 Audis and 1 Mercedes in the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[57,300],"elapsed":49.29772425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
