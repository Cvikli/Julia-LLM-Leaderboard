Here is how you could do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => :count)\nend\n```\n\nThis function groups the data by `model` and counts the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`. The first column contains the unique models from your original DataFrame, and the second column contains the corresponding count of how many times each model appears.","status":200,"tokens":[60,162],"elapsed":27.013898125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
