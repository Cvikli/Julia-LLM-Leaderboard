Here is a possible implementation of the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df_cars, df_cars[:model]) |> length\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `groupby(df_cars, df_cars[:model])` groups the data in `df_cars` by the values in the `model` column.\n* `length` calculates the number of rows in each group.\n\nYou can use this function by calling it with your `DataFrame`, like so:\n```julia\ncount = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a dictionary with the model as the key and the number of rows for that model as the value. For example:\n```julia\nprintln(count[\"Toyota\"]) # Output: 10\n```\nThis would indicate that there are 10 rows in the `df_cars` DataFrame where the value in the `model` column is \"Toyota\".","status":200,"tokens":[1,251],"elapsed":7.942083792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
