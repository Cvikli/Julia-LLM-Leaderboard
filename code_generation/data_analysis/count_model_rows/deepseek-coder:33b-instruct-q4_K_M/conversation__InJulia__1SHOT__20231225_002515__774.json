Here is how you would write this function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Statistics  # We need to import these packages before using them\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return size.(groupby(df, :model), 1)\nend\n```\n\nIn this code, `groupby(df, :model)` groups the dataframe by the column `:model`. The `size` function is then used to find out how many rows there are in each group. This returns a vector of the sizes of the groups (i.e., the number of rows for each model). \n\nNote that if you just want a count without the actual data, it would be more efficient to use `length` instead of `size`:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return length.(groupby(df, :model))\nend\n``` \n\nThis version returns a vector of the counts of the rows for each model. Both functions will return the same result if there are no missing values in the `:model` column. If there are missing values and you want to exclude them from the count, you can add an additional step where you filter out any groups with missing values in the `:model` column.","status":200,"tokens":[60,302],"elapsed":49.582091583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
