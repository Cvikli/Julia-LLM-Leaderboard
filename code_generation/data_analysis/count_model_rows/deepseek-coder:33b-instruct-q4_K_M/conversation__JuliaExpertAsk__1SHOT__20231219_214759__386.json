Here's an example of how you could write a function `count_model_rows` in Julia to count the number of rows in each group of a DataFrame based on the value in a specific column:\n```julia\n# Load the DataFrame\ndf_cars = load(\"cars.csv\")\n\n# Define the function\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame, model::String)\n    # Group the data by model\n    g = groupby(df, model)\n    \n    # Count the number of rows in each group\n    counts = map(g, length)\n    \n    return counts\nend\n\n# Test the function\nprintln(count_model_rows(df_cars, \"Toyota\"))  # Should print [2, 3, 4]\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df` and a model name `model` as input, and returns a list of integers representing the number of rows in each group of data that have the same value in the `model` column.\n\nNote: The `load` function is used to load the DataFrame from a file, you can replace it with the actual DataFrame you want to work with.","status":200,"tokens":[90,264],"elapsed":8.966238208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
