Import Pandas in the following way:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n\n2. Use the read_csv function to load your csv file into a DataFrame object named df_cars:\n\n```python\ndf_cars = pd.read_csv(\"path/to/your/file\")\n```\n\n3. Create a function called count_model_rows that takes in one argument, which is the DataFrame and returns a new DataFrame with the number of rows for each model:\n\n```python\ndef count_model_rows(dataframe):\n    return dataframe[\"model\"].value_counts().to_frame('Count')\n```\n\n4. Call the function to get the result:\n\n```python\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will print a DataFrame with all the models and their row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[0,203],"elapsed":8.223635166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
