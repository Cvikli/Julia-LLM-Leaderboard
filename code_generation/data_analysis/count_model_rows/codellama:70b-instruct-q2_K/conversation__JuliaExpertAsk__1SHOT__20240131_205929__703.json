It takes one argument, which is the DataFrame we want to group and count.\n2. **Grouping**: Inside the function body, we use the `groupby` method on the `model` column of the DataFrame and save it in a variable called `grouped_df`.\n3. **Count rows for each model**: We call the `nrow()` method on our grouped DataFrame, which will count the number of rows for each value of `model`. The result is saved in the variable `counts`.\n4. **Return counts**: Finally, we return the `counts` from our function. This way, when we call it, we'll get the counted rows as the output.\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)::DataFrame\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model); # Group data by model column\n    counts = nrow.(grouped_df);            # Count number of rows for each model value\n    return counts;                         # Return the counted values from our function\nend\n```\nOnce defined, you can use this function to count the number of rows in your DataFrame:","status":200,"tokens":[0,276],"elapsed":11.115425954,"_type":"aimessage"}]
