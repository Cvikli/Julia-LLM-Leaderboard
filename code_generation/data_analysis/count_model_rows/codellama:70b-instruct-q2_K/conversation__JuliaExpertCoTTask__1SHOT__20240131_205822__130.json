Create a function `count_model_rows` that takes in one argument, the DataFrame `df_cars`. Inside this function, create a variable called `grouped_data` and use the `groupby` method on `df_cars` to group the data by the 'model' column.\n2. Then, count the number of rows for each model using the `size` method on the `grouped_data` variable.\n3. Finally, return the result from step 2. This will be a Series showing the counts for each model. The function should look like this:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped_data = df_cars |> groupby(:model);\n    size.(grouped_data)\nend\n```\nYou can try out the code with your sample DataFrame and see if it gives you the expected result.
