Write a function named `count_model_rows` with parameter `df_cars`. This should be the name of your DataFrame.\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nend\n```\n2. Next, you need to group data by model and calculate how many rows there are for each. To do this, use `groupby` and `nrow` functions:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return DataFrames.groupby(df_cars, :model).nrow()\nend\n```\n3. Finally, you need to return the result of this calculation as the output of your function.\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return DataFrames.groupby(df_cars, :model).nrow()\nend\n```\nYour completed `count_model_rows` function should look like this:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return DataFrames.groupby(df_cars, :model).nrow()\nend\n```\nThis will group data by model and calculate how many rows there are for each.","status":200,"tokens":[68,275],"elapsed":11.353711851,"_type":"aimessage"}]
