This code uses the `groupby()` function to create groups based on the \"model\" column and then `count()` to count the number of rows for each group:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    return df |>\n        groupby(:model) |>\n        count()\nend\n```\nThe code above assumes that the DataFrame object is called `df` and has a column named \"model\". You can call this function to generate the desired output as follows:\n```julia\n# Assume your DataFrame has been loaded into variable `df_cars`\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nJulia's pipe operator (`|>`) is used here to make the code easier to read, but you can also write the above function as:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    return count(groupby(df, :model))\nend\n```\nThe `count()` function returns a DataFrame with two columns, \"model\" and \"n\". The value of column \"n\" is the number of rows for each group (i.e., model).","status":200,"tokens":[0,283],"elapsed":11.483935053,"_type":"aimessage"}]
