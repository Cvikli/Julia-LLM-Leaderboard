It then uses the `|>` operator to create a new data frame that contains only the rows where the value in the `model` column matches the given string. Finally, it returns the number of rows in this new data frame.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this function:\n```\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\"], color=[\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"])\n\n# Count the number of rows for each model\ncounts = count_model_rows.(Ref(df_cars), [\"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\"])\n\n# Print the counts\nprintln(\"Counts: $counts\")\n```\nThis will print `Counts: [3, 2, 1]`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,255],"elapsed":7.106779965,"_type":"aimessage"}]
