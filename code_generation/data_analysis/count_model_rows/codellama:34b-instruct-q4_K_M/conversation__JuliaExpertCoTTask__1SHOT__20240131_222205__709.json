Think through your approach step by step:\n\t* Read the input DataFrame `df_cars` and understand its structure.\n\t* Group the data by the `model` column.\n\t* Calculate the number of rows for each group.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\t* Define a function called `count_model_rows`.\n\t* Inside the function, use the `groupby` method to group the data by the `model` column.\n\t* Use the `size` method to calculate the number of rows for each group.\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Call the `count_model_rows` function on the input DataFrame `df_cars`.\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the output matches the expected output. In this case, the expected output is a dictionary with keys as models and values as the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":6.176301489,"_type":"aimessage"}]
