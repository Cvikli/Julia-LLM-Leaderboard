The `::DataFrame` syntax is called \"type annotation\" and it tells Julia that the function expects a `DataFrame` as input.\n* `return df.groupby(\"model\").size()` performs the actual calculation. The `.groupby(\"model\")` method groups the data in the DataFrame by the values in the `\"model\"` column, and then the `.size()` method calculates the number of rows in each group. Finally, the result is returned from the function using the `return` keyword.\n\nTo use this function on a specific DataFrame, you would call it like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"], year = [2015, 2016, 2017, 2018])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis would return a new DataFrame that looks like this:\n```julia\nDataFrame(model = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], count = [3, 4, 5])\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,374],"elapsed":10.461712187,"_type":"aimessage"}]
