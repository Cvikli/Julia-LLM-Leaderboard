Here's an example:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return df |> groupby([:model]) |> count()\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first import the `DataFrames` and `Statistics` modules. Then, we define a function called `count_model_rows` that takes a `DataFrame` as input. We use the `|>` operator to pipe the input data frame into the `groupby` function, which groups the data by the `:model` column. We then use the `count()` method from the `Statistics` module to calculate the number of rows for each group. Finally, we return the resulting data frame.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it on a data frame like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Audi\", \"BMW\", \"Mercedes\"], speed=[100, 150, 200])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(counts)\n```\nThis will output a data frame with three columns: `model`, `speed`, and `n`. The `n` column contains the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[0,339],"elapsed":9.456274516,"_type":"aimessage"}]
