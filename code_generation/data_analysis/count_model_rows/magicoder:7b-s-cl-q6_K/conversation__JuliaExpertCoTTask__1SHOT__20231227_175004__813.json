The result is returned as another DataFrame where row names are unique models and column values represent number of times that model appears in original dataframe.\n\nIf you run this code, you'll get the following output:\n```julia\n1×2 DataFrame\n│ Row │ model   │ _col0_ │\n├─────┼─────────┼───────┤\n│ 1   │ a4      │ 3     │\n│ 2   │ a6      │ 1     │\n│ 3   │ q7      │ 1     │\n```\nThis shows that \"a4\" appears three times in the `model` column, while \"a6\" and \"q7\" each appear once.","status":200,"tokens":[211,324],"elapsed":17.584105542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
