We'll use the `groupby` function from DataFrames.jl package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Dates\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = combine(grouped, nrow => identity => \"count\")\nend\n```\nIn this function, `groupby` groups the data by model and `combine` calculates the number of rows for each group. The result is a new DataFrame where each row represents a unique model from your original DataFrame and has an additional column \"count\" that holds the count of rows belonging to this model.\n\nYou can use the function like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Fiat\", \"Honda\"])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(counts)\n```\nThis will output:\n| model | count |\n|-------|-------|\n| Ford  | 2     |\n| Honda | 2     |\n| Toyota| 1     |\n| Fiat  | 1     |","status":200,"tokens":[100,282],"elapsed":14.770430666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
