Here's an example:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, CategoricalArrays\n\n# Assuming df_cars is your dataframe and it has a column named \"model\" \nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return combine(count, grouped)\nend\n```\nThis function takes in a DataFrame as an argument. It groups the DataFrame by the `model` column and then counts how many rows are in each group using the `combine` function. The result is a new DataFrame that has one row for each unique value in the `model` column, along with a second column called \"count\" which represents the number of rows in each group.","status":200,"tokens":[100,186],"elapsed":9.921164292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
