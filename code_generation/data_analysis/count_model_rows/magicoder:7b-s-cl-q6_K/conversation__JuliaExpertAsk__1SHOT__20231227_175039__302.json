Below is an example implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model)\n    return nrow.(grouped)\nend\n```\n\nThis function `count_model_rows` takes a dataframe df as input and returns an array of integers. Each integer is the number of rows for each unique model in the DataFrame. \n\nNote: The function assumes that there is a column named \"model\" in your DataFrame, if it's different you should replace \":model\" with the appropriate column name. Also, this solution requires that `DataFrame` package is installed in your Julia environment. If not, you can add it by running `Pkg.add(\"DataFrames\")` in your Julia REPL.","status":200,"tokens":[100,196],"elapsed":10.427873541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
