The result is a new DataFrame where each row contains the model name and the number of occurrences (`count`).\n\nLet's test it:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(result)\n```\nThis should return a new DataFrame with one row for each unique model in `df_cars` and the number of occurrences:\n```julia\n| Row | model  | count |\n|-----|--------|-------|\n| 1   | \"a4\"   | 3     |\n| 2   | \"a6\"   | 1     |\n| 3   | \"q7\"   | 1     |\n```\nThis means that the model `\"a4\"` appears 3 times, the model `\"a6\"` and `\"q7\"` each appear once.","status":200,"tokens":[211,393],"elapsed":22.082421625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
