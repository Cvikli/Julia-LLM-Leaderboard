It allows for grouping by a particular column and performing operations on each group of rows separately. Here is how it can be done:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model) # Group the dataframe by the 'model' column\n    counts = nrow.(grouped)      # For each group calculate the number of rows and store them in an array\n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function will return a Vector where each element is the number of rows for each model. This vector can then be used to find out how many rows are there for each model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[60,174],"elapsed":8.998395416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
