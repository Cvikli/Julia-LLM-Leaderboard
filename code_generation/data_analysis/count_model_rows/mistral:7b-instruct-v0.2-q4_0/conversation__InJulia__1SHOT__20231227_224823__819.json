Here's an example of how to define the function `count_model_rows`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    groups = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = map(groups, size) do x\n        return x[1]\n    end\n    result = DataFrame(Groups=names(groups), Count=counts)\n    return result\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call this function to get a new `DataFrame` containing the group names and their respective counts:\n\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(result)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[55,206],"elapsed":6.505450875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
