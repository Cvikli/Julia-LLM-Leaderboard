Here's a simple way to create the `count_model_rows` function:\n\nFirst, let's ensure that your DataFrame `df_cars` has been imported. Assuming it's defined in the global scope, no need to import it explicitly.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames, Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n  # Using groupby and size to accomplish the task\n  groups = groupby(df, :model)\n  counts = [size(group)[1] for group in groups]\n  \n  # Optionally, create a new DataFrame with models and corresponding row counts\n  result = DataFrame(Model = names(df), Count = counts)\n  return result\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call this function on your `df_cars` DataFrame to get the number of rows for each car model. For example:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota Corolla\", \"Honda Civic\", \"Mazda3\", \"Toyota Corolla\", \"Ford Focus\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(result)\n```\n\nThis will output a new DataFrame with columns `Model` and `Count`, where the rows represent each unique car model and their corresponding number of occurrences in the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[55,335],"elapsed":10.438484459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
