Think through the approach: We'll use Julia's built-in `groupby` and `size` functions to group the DataFrame by `model` and then get the size of each group (number of rows).\n\n2. Write the function:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    groups = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = mapvalues(groups, x -> length(x))\n    return DataFrame(Groups = names(groups), Count = values(counts))\nend\n```\n\n3.
