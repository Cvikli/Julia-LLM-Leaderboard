We'll use the `groupby` method to group by the \"model\" column and then apply a lambda function that counts the number of rows in each group using the `size` attribute.\n```python\ncount_model_rows = pd.Series(df_cars.groupby('model'), 'model').size()\n```\n\nStep 3: Check the result\nWe can check if our function correctly groups the data and calculates the row counts for each model by converting the Series back to a DataFrame and printing it.\n```python\nresult = pd.DataFrame(count_model_rows, columns=['Count']).sort_values('Count', ascending=False)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis should display a DataFrame with two columns: \"Model\" showing the unique models from the original \"model\" column and \"Count\", showing the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[208,308],"elapsed":8.611709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
