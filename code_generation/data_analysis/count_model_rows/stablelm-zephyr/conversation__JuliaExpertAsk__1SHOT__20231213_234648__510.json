Here is a possible implementation of the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group data by model\n    groups = groupby(df_cars, df_cars.model)\n\n    # Calculate number of rows for each group\n    num_rows = length(groups)\n\n    return num_rows\nend\n```\nThis function takes a `DataFrame` object as input, groups the data by the `model` column using the `groupby` function, and then calculates the number of rows in each group using the `length` function. The result is a vector of numbers, where each number represents the number of rows in a particular model group.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[90,190],"elapsed":6.581834625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
