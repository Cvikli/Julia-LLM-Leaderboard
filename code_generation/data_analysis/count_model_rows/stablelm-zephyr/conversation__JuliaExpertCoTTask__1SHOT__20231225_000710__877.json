This function should group the data in the DataFrame by the column named `model` and then calculate the number of rows for each unique model present in the data. The result should be a Series (one-dimensional array) containing the count of rows for each unique model.\n\nData:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom julialang import BaseType, IntType\n\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({'model': ['a4', 'a6', 'a4', 'q7', 'a4']})\n```\n\nFunctionality:\n1. Define the function `count_model_rows` that takes a DataFrame as input, named `df_cars`.\n2. Inside the function, use the `groupby` method from pandas to group the data by the `model` column.\n3. Calculate the size of each grouped object using the `size` method and assign it back to the variable `counts`.\n4. Convert the counts Series into a DataFrame with two columns: 'Model' (the unique model names) and 'Count' (the corresponding count of rows for each model).\n5. Return the resulting dataframe.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n```python\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars: DataFrame) -> DataFrame {\ncounts = df_cars.groupby('model')['model'].size()\nresult = pd.DataFrame({'Model': counts.unique(), 'Count': counts})\nreturn result\n}\n```\nNow, let's test the function with the given data:\n```python\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThe output should be:\n```\nModelCount\n0a43\n1q71\n```","status":200,"tokens":[208,421],"elapsed":8.113931167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
