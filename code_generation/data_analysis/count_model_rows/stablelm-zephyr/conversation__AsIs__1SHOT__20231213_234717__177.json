Here is an example of how you could write a function `count_model_rows` that groups the data in the `df_cars` DataFrame by model and counts the number of rows for each group:\n```\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    # Create a dictionary to count the number of rows for each model\n    model_counts = {}\n    for model in df_cars['model']:\n        # Get the number of rows for this model\n        row_count = df_cars[df_cars['model'] == model].shape[0]\n        # Add the row count to the dictionary\n        model_counts[model] = row_count\n    return model_counts\n```\nTo use this function, you can simply call it and pass in the `df_cars` DataFrame as an argument:\n```\n# Count the number of rows for each model in df_cars\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(model_counts)\n```\nThis will output a dictionary with the number of rows for each model in `df_cars`. For example:\n```\n{'Toyota': 10, 'Ford': 5, 'Honda': 8, 'Nissan': 7}\n```\nI hope this helps!
