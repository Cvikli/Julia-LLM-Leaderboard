Think through your approach step by step:\n   - We need to group the DataFrame based on the column \"model\" and calculate the number of rows for each unique model.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Use the groupby function from DataFramesBase to group by model\n    # Then, use size to get the number of rows for each group\n    result = size.(groupby(df, :model), 1)\n\n    # Convert the array of arrays into a single array and then into a DataFrame for easier manipulation\n    data = map(x -> size(x,1), result)\n    df_result = DataFrame(Model = repeat(df.model, outsize(data)), Rows = data)\n\n    return df_result\nend\n```\n\n3.
