Think through my approach step by step:\n   - Given a DataFrame df_cars with column 'model', we need to group data by model and calculate how many rows there are for each.\n   - We can use Julia's built-in function `groupby` from the `DataFrames` package for this task.\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n   - No new functions or code needed in this case since we can use Julia's built-in functions.\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ncount_model_rows(df::DataFrame) = size(groupby(df, :model), 1)\n```\n\n4.
