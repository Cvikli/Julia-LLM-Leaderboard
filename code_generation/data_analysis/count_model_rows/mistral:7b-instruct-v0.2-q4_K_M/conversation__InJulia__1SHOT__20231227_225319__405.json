Here's how you can write the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped_data = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = Dict()\n    for group in grouped_data\n        model = group.key\n        num_rows = size(group.data, 1)\n        counts[model] = num_rows\n    end\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a single argument `df_cars`, which is the DataFrame containing the car data. It returns a dictionary (or `Dict` in Julia), where each key is a unique car model, and the value is the number of rows in that group (or sub-DataFrame).\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your `df_cars` DataFrame as an argument:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"Toyota Corolla\", \"Honda Civic\", \"Ford Focus\", \"Toyota Corolla\", \"Honda Civic\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```julia\nDict(\"Toyota Corolla\" => 2, \"Ford Focus\" => 1, \"Honda Civic\" => 2)\n```\n\nYou can now access the count of rows for each model by using the keys of the dictionary.","status":200,"tokens":[55,397],"elapsed":15.68357625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
