Here's how you can define the function `count_model_rows(df_cars)`:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = [size(value, 1) for value in groups(grouped)]\n    DataFrame(Model=names(grouped), Count=counts)\nend\n```\n\nYou can then call the `count_model_rows` function with your DataFrame as an argument to get a new DataFrame with the number of rows for each unique model:\n\n```julia\ndf_model_count = count_model_rows(df_cars)\ndisplay(df_model_count)\n```\n\nThis will output a DataFrame with two columns - `Model` and `Count`, where `Model` shows the name of each unique car model, and `Count` shows the number of rows in `df_cars` for that specific model.","status":200,"tokens":[55,274],"elapsed":10.875834666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
