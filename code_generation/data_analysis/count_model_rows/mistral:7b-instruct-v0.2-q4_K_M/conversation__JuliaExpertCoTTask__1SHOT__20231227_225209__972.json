Write any functions and other code you need:\n   ```julia\n   function count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n       # Use groupby and length to achieve the desired result\n       groups = groupby(df, :model)\n       counts = [length(value) for value ∈ values(groups)]\n       DataFrame(Model=names(groups), Count=counts)\n   end\n   ```\n\n3.
