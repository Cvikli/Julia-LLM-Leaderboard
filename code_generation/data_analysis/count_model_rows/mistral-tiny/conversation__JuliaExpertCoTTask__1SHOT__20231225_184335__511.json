Think through your approach:\n   - Group the DataFrame by the column `model` to create groups.\n   - Use the `size` function to calculate the number of rows in each group.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # your code here\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    groups = groupby(df, :model)\n    counts = [Int(size(group)[1] for group in groups]\n    return DataFrame(Model = names(groups), Count = counts)\nend\n```\n\n4.
