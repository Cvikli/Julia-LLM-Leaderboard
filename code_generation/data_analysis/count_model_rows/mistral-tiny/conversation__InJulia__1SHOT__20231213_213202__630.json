For example:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota Corolla\", \"Honda Civic\", \"Toyota Corolla\", \"Ford Focus\", \"Honda Civic\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n# Output: Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:\n#  \"Ford Focus\" => Int64(1)\n#  \"Honda Civic\" => Int64(2)\n#  \"Toyota Corolla\" => Int64(2)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[57,360],"elapsed":3.727426167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
