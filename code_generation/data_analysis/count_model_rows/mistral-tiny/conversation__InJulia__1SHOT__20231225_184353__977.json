Here's how you can define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    groups = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = [(model, length(value)) for (model, value) in groups]\n    DataFrame(model = [g.first for g in groups], count = [Int64(c) for c in sizes(groups)])\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument, groups the DataFrame by column `model`, and calculates the number of rows for each group using the `length` function. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`.","status":200,"tokens":[57,225],"elapsed":1.984114958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
