Here's how you could do it using the `groupby` function from the `pandas` library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function that groups the DataFrame by model and returns the count of rows for each model.\n\n    Parameters:\n    df_cars (pandas.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the car data.\n\n    Returns:\n    pandas.DataFrame: A new DataFrame with two columns: 'model' and 'count'. The 'model' column contains the unique car models, and the 'count' column contains the number of rows for each model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Group the DataFrame by the 'model' column and count the number of rows for each group\n    result = df_cars.groupby('model').size().reset_index(name='count')\n\n    return result\n```\n\nTo use this function, simply call it with your DataFrame as the argument:\n\n```python\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(counts)\n```\n\nThis will return a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`. The `model` column will contain the unique car models, and the `count` column will contain the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[55,350],"elapsed":3.050075041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
