Here's a brief and concise solution to your question:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    return GroupedTables.groupby(df_cars, :model) |> count\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `GroupedTables.groupby` is a built-in function in Julia that allows us to group data by one or more columns. In this case, we're grouping the `df_cars` DataFrame by the `:model` column.\n* The pipe symbol `|>` is used to pass the result of the `groupby` function to the `count` function, which counts the number of rows in each group.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the `model` column in `df_cars` is a string or numerical column. If it's a categorical column, you may need to use the `GroupedTables.groupby` function with the `::Types.String` or `::Types.Numeric` argument instead.","status":200,"tokens":[90,229],"elapsed":7.855286,"_type":"aimessage"}]
