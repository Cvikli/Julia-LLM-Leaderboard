Here's a concise solution to your problem:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return groupby(df_cars, df_cars[:model]) |> length\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `groupby(df_cars, df_cars[:model])` groups the rows of `df_cars` by the values in the `model` column.\n* `length` calculates the number of rows in each group.\n\nYou can run this function with a DataFrame as argument, like this:\n```julia\ndf_cars = load(\"cars.csv\")\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will output the number of rows for each model in `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[1,183],"elapsed":5.748217291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
