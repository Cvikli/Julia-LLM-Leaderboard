Here's a concise solution to your request:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return groupby(df_cars, df_cars[:model]) |> length\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `groupby` is used to group the data by the `model` column.\n* The resulting group is then piped to the `length` function, which calculates the number of rows in each group.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the DataFrame `df_cars` has a single column named `model`. If your DataFrame has multiple columns, you can modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[90,148],"elapsed":5.212132375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
