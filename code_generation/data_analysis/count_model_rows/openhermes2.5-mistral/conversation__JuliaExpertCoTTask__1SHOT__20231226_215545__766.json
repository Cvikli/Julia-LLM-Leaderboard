We will use the GroupBy function from DataFramesMeta, which allows us to group the DataFrame by columns. Then, we can calculate the number of rows in each group using the size() function.\n\nStep 2: Write any functions and other code you need\nFirst, let's define our function `count_model_rows`.\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    # Your code goes here\nend\n```\n\nStep 3: Solve the task\nNow we will implement the solution using the GroupBy and size() functions.\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df, :model) # Group data by model\n    result = [(group=groupname(i), size=size(i)) for i in grouped] # Create a tuple of (group, size) for each group\n    return result                          # Return the result\nend\n```\n\nStep 4: Check that your solution is correct\nLet's test our function with the provided DataFrame `df_cars`.\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe expected output is `[(:a4, 3), (:q7, 1), (:a6, 1)]`, which represents the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[215,403],"elapsed":18.639364833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
