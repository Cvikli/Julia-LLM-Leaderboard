In this case, we're calculating the size of each group using the Size constructor with an array containing only the group itself (denoted as `[_]`). The result is a dictionary where the keys are the unique models and the values are the sizes of the groups.\n\nFinally, the function converts this dictionary into a DataFrame by passing it to the DataFrame constructor, setting the `copycols=false` option to avoid copying the column names.","status":200,"tokens":[104,257],"elapsed":8.273244458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
