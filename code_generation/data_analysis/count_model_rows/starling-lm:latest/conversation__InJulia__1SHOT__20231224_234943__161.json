Then, it initializes an empty dictionary `result` to store the count of rows for each unique model. It then iterates through each group in the grouped DataFrame and stores the count of rows for that specific model in the `result` dictionary.\n\nTo use this function with your DataFrame `df_cars`, simply call it like this:\n\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThe `result` variable will now contain a dictionary where the keys are the unique models in the `model` column and the values are the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[64,287],"elapsed":8.849930375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
