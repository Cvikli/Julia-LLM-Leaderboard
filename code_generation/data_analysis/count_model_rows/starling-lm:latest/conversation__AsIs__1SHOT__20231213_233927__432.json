I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's an example of how you could create a function `count_model_rows` in Python using the pandas library:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    # Group data by model\n    grouped_data = df_cars.groupby('model')\n    \n    # Calculate number of rows for each model\n    num_rows = grouped_data.size()\n    \n    return num_rows\n```\nYou can then call this function by passing in your `df_cars` DataFrame, like so:\n```\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will output the number of rows for each model in the `df_cars`.\n\nAlternatively, you could use the `value_counts` method of the `groupby` object to get the number of rows for each model:\n```\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    # Group data by model\n    grouped_data = df_cars.groupby('model')\n    \n    # Calculate number of rows for each model\n    num_rows = grouped_data.value_counts()\n    \n    return num_rows\n```\nBoth of these approaches will give you the same result, which is the number of rows in each group for each model in the `df_cars`.
