Here's a sample implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df, column):\n    # Group by column and count the number of rows in each group\n    result = df.groupby(column)['model'].size()\n    return result\n```\n\nTo use this function on your DataFrame `df_cars`, you can simply call it as follows:\n\n```python\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars, 'model')\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will print the number of rows for each unique model in your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[61,182],"elapsed":5.716846583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
