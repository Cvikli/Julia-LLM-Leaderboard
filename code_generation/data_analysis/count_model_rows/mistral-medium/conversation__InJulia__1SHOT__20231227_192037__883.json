Here's a sample function definition:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped_df = combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => n -> n)\n    return grouped_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` and groups it by the `model` column using `groupby`. Then, it combines the groups using `combine`, counting the number of rows for each group with the `nrow` function. The resulting DataFrame `grouped_df` will have two columns: `model` and `nrow`, with the latter indicating the number of rows for each car model.","status":200,"tokens":[58,186],"elapsed":8.757762042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
