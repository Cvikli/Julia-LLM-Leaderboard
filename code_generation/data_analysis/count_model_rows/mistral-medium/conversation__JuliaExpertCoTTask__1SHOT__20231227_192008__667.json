Think through your approach step by step:\n\t* Group the data by the `model` column using the `groupby` function.\n\t* Count the number of rows in each group using the `nrow` function.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    model_counts = Dict{String,Int}()\n    for (model, group) in grouped\n        model_counts[model] = nrow(group)\n    end\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n3.
