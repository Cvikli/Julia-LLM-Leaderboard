It then uses the `combine` function to count the number of rows in each group using the `nrow` function and renames the resulting column to `num_rows`. The resulting DataFrame contains the count of rows for each car model.","status":200,"tokens":[58,209],"elapsed":17.952196833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
