The `reset_index` function then converts the index of the resulting series back into a column named 'count'.\n\nYou can then call the function like this:\n\n```\n# Assuming df_cars is your dataframe\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will print out a new dataframe with two columns: 'model' and 'count', where 'count' is the number of rows for each 'model' in the original dataframe.","status":200,"tokens":[56,227],"elapsed":20.377606375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
