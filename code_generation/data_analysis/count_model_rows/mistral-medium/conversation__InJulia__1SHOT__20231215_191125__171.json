Here's a sample function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group data by model and count the number of rows for each group\n    model_counts = combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => :count)\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input, groups it by the `model` column using `groupby`, and then counts the number of rows in each group using `nrow => :count`. The result is a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `count`.\n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame to get the desired result:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame `model_counts` with the number of rows for each car model.","status":200,"tokens":[58,255],"elapsed":22.959851,"_type":"aimessage"}]
