Think through the approach:\n* We need to group the data by the `model` column\n* Then count the number of rows in each group\n* Return the result as a DataFrame or a dictionary\n\n2. Write the function:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    groups = combine(df, :model => nrow => :count)\n    return groups\nend\n```\n3.
