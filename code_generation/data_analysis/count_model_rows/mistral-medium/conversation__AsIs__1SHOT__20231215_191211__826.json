The result is a `Series` object containing the counts, with the car models as the index.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this function:\n```\n# Create a sample DataFrame\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {\n    'model': ['Toyota Corolla', 'Honda Civic', 'Toyota Camry', 'Honda Accord', 'Toyota Corolla', 'Honda Civic'],\n    'year': [2010, 2015, 2012, 2017, 2011, 2016],\n    'price': [15000, 18000, 20000, 25000, 16000, 17000]\n}\n\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Use the function to count the number of rows for each car model\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nprint(model_counts)\n```\nThis would output the following:\n```\nToyota Corolla    2\nHonda Civic       2\nToyota Camry      1\nHonda Accord      1\ndtype: int64\n```\nThis shows that there are 2 rows for the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic models, and 1 row for the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord models.","status":200,"tokens":[56,505],"elapsed":45.66770425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
