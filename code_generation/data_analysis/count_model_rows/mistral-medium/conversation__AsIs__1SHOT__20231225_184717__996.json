The result is a pandas Series with the unique values as the index and the counts as the values.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use this function:\n```\n# create a sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({\n    'model': ['Toyota Corolla', 'Honda Civic', 'Toyota Camry', 'Honda Accord', 'Toyota Corolla', 'Honda Civic'],\n    'year': [2010, 2015, 2012, 2018, 2005, 2020],\n    'price': [15000, 20000, 18000, 25000, 12000, 22000]\n})\n\n# use the count_model_rows function to count the number of rows for each model\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\nprint(model_counts)\n```\nThis would output the following:\n```\nToyota Corolla    2\nHonda Civic        2\nToyota Camry      1\nHonda Accord       1\nName: model, dtype: int64\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[56,414],"elapsed":18.411631375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
