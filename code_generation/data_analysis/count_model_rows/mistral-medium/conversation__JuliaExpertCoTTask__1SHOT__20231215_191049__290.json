Think through your approach step by step:\n\n   - Group the data by the `model` column using the `groupby` function from the DataFrames.jl package.\n   - Count the number of rows in each group using the `nrow` function.\n   - Return the result as a new DataFrame.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    grouped_data = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    model_counts = combine(grouped_data, nrow)\n    rename!(model_counts, :nrow => :count)\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```\n2×2 DataFrame\n Row │ model  │ count\n     │ String │ Int64\n─────┼────────┼───────\n   1 │ a4     │     3\n   2 │ a6     │     1\n   3 │ q7     │     1\n```\n\nThis indicates that there are 3 rows with the model \"a4\", 1 row with the model \"a6\", and 1 row with the model \"q7\".","status":200,"tokens":[209,373],"elapsed":37.2920725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
