Then, it creates a dictionary comprehension where each key-value pair corresponds to a model name and its row count. \n\nYou can use this function with your DataFrame like this:\n```python\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[61,251],"elapsed":9.936279375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
