It then iterates over these groups and calculates the number of rows in each using a helper function `count_rows` (not provided here, but it would simply return the length of the group). Finally, it stores the counts in a dictionary where the keys are the unique models and the values are the corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[100,226],"elapsed":31.338268833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
