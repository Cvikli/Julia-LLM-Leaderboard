First, it groups the data by the `model` column using the `by` operation. Then, for each group, it counts all rows using a lambda expression that always returns `true` (this is a quick way to count the number of rows in each group without having to specify what columns to use). Finally, it collects the results into an array.","status":200,"tokens":[100,138],"elapsed":20.101614167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
