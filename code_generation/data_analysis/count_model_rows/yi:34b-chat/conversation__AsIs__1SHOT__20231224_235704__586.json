Below is a Python function that you can use to count the number of rows for each model in a `DataFrame` named `df_cars`. The function takes the `DataFrame` as an argument and returns a Series object with the counts for each model.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    return df_cars['model'].value_counts()\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming you have already imported your DataFrame as df_cars\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({'model': ['Model A', 'Model B', 'Model C', 'Model A', 'Model D']})\nprint(count_model_rows(df_cars))\n```\n\nThis function uses the `value_counts()` method on the `model` column to count how many times each unique model appears in the data. The result is a Series where the index contains the distinct models and the values are the counts of those models.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes that the `df_cars` DataFrame has a column named `model` containing the different car models you want to count. Adjust the column name as needed for your specific dataset.","status":200,"tokens":[58,261],"elapsed":34.476057625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
