It then applies a `mapreduce` operation over each group, returning a tuple of `(nrow::Int64, model::String)`. Finally, it filters out models that have zero rows (since they would be removed by grouping anyway) and ensures that the result has the same dimensions as the original DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[100,207],"elapsed":28.918071292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
