The resulting object is a `GroupedDataFrame`, which is then piped (`|>`) into the `combine` function. The `combine` function takes a vector of grouped rows and a set of operations to perform on those rows. In this case, we're using the `nrow` function to count the number of rows in each group.\n\nThe result is a new `DataFrame` with two columns: `model` and `nrow`. The `model` column contains the unique values from the original `model` column, and the `nrow` column contains the corresponding row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[99,273],"elapsed":3.794260666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
