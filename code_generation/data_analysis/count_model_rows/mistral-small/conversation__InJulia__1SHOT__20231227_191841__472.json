Here's how you can define the `count_model_rows` function in Julia using the DataFrames.jl package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return groupby(df_cars, :model) |> x -> combine(x, nrow => :count)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input and returns a new DataFrame that shows the count of rows for each unique car model. The `groupby` function is used to group the DataFrame by the `model` column, and then the `combine` function is used to calculate the number of rows in each group. The `nrow` function is used to count the number of rows, and the `=>` operator is used to rename the resulting column to `count`.","status":200,"tokens":[57,203],"elapsed":2.813905125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
