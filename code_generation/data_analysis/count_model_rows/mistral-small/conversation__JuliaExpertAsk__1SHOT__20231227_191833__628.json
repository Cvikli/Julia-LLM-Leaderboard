Since `df_cars.model` is a vector of strings representing the car models, we can pass it directly to `countmap`.\n\nIf you specifically want the result to be a `DataFrame`, you can modify the function as follows:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    counts = countmap(df_cars.model)\n    return DataFrame(model = keys(counts), n = values(counts))\nend\n```\nThis version of the function creates a `DataFrame` with two columns: `model` containing the unique car models, and `n` containing the number of rows for each model.","status":200,"tokens":[99,292],"elapsed":4.036799667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
