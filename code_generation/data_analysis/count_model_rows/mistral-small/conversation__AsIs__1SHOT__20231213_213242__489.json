Here's an example function in Python using pandas library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    \"\"\"\n    Groups data in df_cars by model and calculates the number of rows for each.\n\n    Parameters:\n    df_cars (pandas.DataFrame): The input DataFrame with 'model' column.\n\n    Returns:\n    pandas.DataFrame: A new DataFrame with two columns 'model' and 'counts', where 'counts' is the number of rows for each model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Group data by model and calculate the number of rows for each\n    df_grouped = df_cars.groupby('model').size().reset_index(name='counts')\n\n    return df_grouped\n```\n\nYou can use this function by passing your DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument:\n\n```python\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe resulting DataFrame `result` will have two columns: 'model' and 'counts', where 'counts' is the number of rows for each car model.","status":200,"tokens":[55,287],"elapsed":5.443258333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
