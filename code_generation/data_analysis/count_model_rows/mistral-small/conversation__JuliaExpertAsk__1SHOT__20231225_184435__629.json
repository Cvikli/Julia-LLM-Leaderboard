It then pipes the resulting groups to the `combine` function, which calculates the number of rows in each group using the `nrow` function. The result is a new DataFrame with the same `model` column as the original, but with an additional column `nrow` that contains the count of rows for each `model`.","status":200,"tokens":[99,180],"elapsed":2.7191835,"_type":"aimessage"}]
