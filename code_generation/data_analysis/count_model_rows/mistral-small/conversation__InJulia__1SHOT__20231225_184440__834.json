Here's a function written in Julia that should do what you're asking for. This function uses the `DataFrames.jl` package to manipulate the DataFrame.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    return groupby(df_cars, :model) |> x -> combine(x, nrow)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the DataFrame `df_cars` by the `:model` column. Then it pipes this grouped DataFrame to the `combine` function, which applies the `nrow` function to each group, effectively counting the number of rows in each group. The result is a new DataFrame with the unique models and the number of rows for each.","status":200,"tokens":[57,184],"elapsed":2.613914667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
