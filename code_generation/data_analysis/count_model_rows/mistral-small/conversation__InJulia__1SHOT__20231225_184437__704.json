This function uses the `DataFrames.jl` package to work with the DataFrame.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counted_df = combine(grouped_df, nrow => :count)\n    return counted_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the DataFrame `df_cars` by the `:model` column. Then, it counts the number of rows in each group using the `nrow` function and the `combine` function. The result is a new DataFrame `counted_df` with the same groups as `grouped_df`, but with an additional column `:count` that contains the number of rows in each group.","status":200,"tokens":[57,203],"elapsed":2.763994459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
