The `model` column contains the unique car models, and the `nrow` column contains the number of rows (i.e., instances) for each model.\n\nThe `groupby` function groups the rows of `df_cars` by the `model` column. The resulting object is a `GroupedDataFrame`, which is then piped into the `combine` function using the `|>` operator. The `combine` function takes a vector of `DataFrame`s and applies a set of operations to each group, specified as a function or a `NamedTuple` of functions. In this case, we're using the `nrow` function to count the number of rows in each group.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that you have already loaded the `DataFrames` package, which provides the necessary data structures and functions for working with tabular data in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[99,300],"elapsed":6.303800208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
