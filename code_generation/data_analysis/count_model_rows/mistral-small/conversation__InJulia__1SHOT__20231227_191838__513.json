This function uses the `DataFrames` and `Statistics` packages, so make sure you have those installed.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars)\n    grouped_df = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counted_df = combine(grouped_df, nrow => :count)\n    return counted_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function first groups the data frame `df_cars` by the `:model` column. Then, it uses the `combine` function to create a new data frame where each row contains a unique model and the number of rows (i.e., the count) for that model. The `nrow` function is used to count the number of rows in each group, and the `=>` operator is used to rename the resulting column to `:count`.","status":200,"tokens":[57,218],"elapsed":3.063826,"_type":"aimessage"}]
