Here's an example function in Python using pandas to achieve what you described:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    \"\"\"\n    Groups data in df_cars by model and counts the number of rows for each.\n\n    Args:\n        df_cars (pandas.DataFrame): The input DataFrame containing a 'model' column.\n\n    Returns:\n        pandas.DataFrame: A new DataFrame containing the grouped data with the count of rows for each model.\n    \"\"\"\n    return df_cars.groupby('model').size().reset_index(name='counts')\n```\nThis function takes the input DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument and returns a new DataFrame that contains the grouped data by the `model` column, along with the count of rows for each model.\n\nYou can use this function by passing your `df_cars` DataFrame to it like this:\n```python\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis will print the resulting DataFrame to the console.","status":200,"tokens":[55,272],"elapsed":3.75626425,"_type":"aimessage"}]
