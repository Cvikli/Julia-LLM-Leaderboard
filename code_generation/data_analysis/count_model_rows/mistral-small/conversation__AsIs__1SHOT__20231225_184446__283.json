The `groupby` function returns a GroupBy object, which we then use the `size` function on to count the number of rows in each group. This returns a Series where the index is the unique values in the 'model' column and the values are the counts of each group.","status":200,"tokens":[55,148],"elapsed":2.177831209,"_type":"aimessage"}]
