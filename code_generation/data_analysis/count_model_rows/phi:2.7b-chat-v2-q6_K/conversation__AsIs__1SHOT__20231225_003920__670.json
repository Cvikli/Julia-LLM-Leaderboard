However, your system should have a condition: If there are two models with the same highest price, it should select the one whose name comes first alphabetically. \n\nQuestion: What Python code would you write to accomplish this?\n\n\nFirst, sort the dataframe by the `Price` column in descending order (highest to lowest). Then, groupby the 'Model' column and use a lambda function to find the model with the highest price. \n```python\ndf_sorted = df.sort_values('Price', ascending=False)\ntop_model = df_sorted['Model'].groupby(df_sorted['Price']).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[0])\n```\nNow, check if there is a tie for the highest price by comparing the length of the top_model dataframe with that of `df`. \n```python\nif len(top_model) > 1:\ntop_model = df_sorted['Model'].groupby(df_sorted['Price']).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[0])\n```\nFinally, sort the dataframe by the 'Model' column in ascending order and select the first model name from the top_model dataframe. \n```python\ntop_model = df_sorted['Model'].groupby(df_sorted['Price']).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[0])\nif len(top_model) > 1:\ntop_model = df_sorted['Model'].groupby(df_sorted['Price']).apply(lambda x: x.iloc[0]).sort_values()\ntop_model_price, top_model_name = top_model.iloc[0]\n```\nAnswer: The Python code to accomplish this task is the one provided in steps 1-3 and 4 above.","status":200,"tokens":[51,623],"elapsed":16.248223084,"_type":"aimessage"}]
