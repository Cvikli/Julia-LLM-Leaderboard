I'd be happy to help you with that. Here is an example of how you could create a function `count_model_rows` in Python using Pandas:\n```\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    # Group the data by model\n    counts = df_cars.groupby('model')[' rows'].size()\n    \n    # Return the number of rows for each model\n    return counts\n```\nHere's how you could use this function:\n```\n# Load the DataFrame\ndf_cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')\n\n# Count the number of rows for each model\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(counts)\n```\nThis will output something like:\n```\nmodel   0   1   2   3\nToyota    5   3   2   1\nFord      4   2   1   0\nHonda     3   2   1   0\n...\n```\nThe first column is the model, and the second column is the number of rows for each model.\n\nI hope this helps!
