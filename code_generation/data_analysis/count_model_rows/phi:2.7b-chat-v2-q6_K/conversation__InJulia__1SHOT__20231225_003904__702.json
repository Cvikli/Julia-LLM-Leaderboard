The data is as follows:\n\n```python\ndata = [[\"Ford\", \"Mustang\", 1964],\n        [\"Tesla\", \"Model S\", 2020],\n        [\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2018],\n        [\"Ford\", \"F-150\", 2022],\n        [\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2017],\n        [\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2016]]\n```\n\nYou are a Network Security Specialist who has been hired by the CEO of a car company to analyze their customer database. The data is in `df_cars`. Your task is to write a Python function that uses DataFrame grouping functionality and then counts how many cars were sold from each make (e.g., Ford, Toyota, etc.) in a particular year.\n\nQuestion: How many cars of the brand 'Tesla' were sold in 2020?\n\n\nFirst, create a DataFrame from the given data using `pandas`.\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['make', 'model', 'year'])\nprint(df_cars)\n```\nThis will result in:\n```\n   make  model  year\n0 Ford  Mustang  1964\n1 Tesla Model S  2020\n2 Toyota Camry  2018\n3 Ford  F-150  2022\n4 Toyota Corolla 2017\n5 Honda Civic  2016\n```\nNext, use DataFrame's `groupby()` function to group the cars by 'make' and then filter out those that were sold in the year 2020. We can count how many there are using the `count()` function.\n```python\ndef get_cars_sold(df, brand, year):\n    return df[(df['make'] == brand) & (df['year'] == year)].groupby('make').size().reset_index(name='counts')\n\nprint(get_cars_sold(df_cars, 'Tesla', 2020))\n```\nThis will result in:\n```python\n   make  counts\n1 Tesla    1\n```\nSo, there was one car sold by the brand 'Tesla' in the year 2020.\n\nAnswer: There was one car of the brand 'Tesla' sold in 2020.","status":200,"tokens":[54,722],"elapsed":19.017687125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
