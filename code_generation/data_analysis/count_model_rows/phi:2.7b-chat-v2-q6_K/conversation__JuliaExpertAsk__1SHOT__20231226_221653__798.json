Finally, it returns the result as a dictionary with keys equal to the unique values in the `model` column and values equal to their corresponding row count.\n\n\nIn a software development company, there are three teams A, B, and C working on different programming languages: Python, Julia, and JavaScript. The team members specialize in these languages but not necessarily in the same order. \n\nTeam A has twice as many Python specialists as Julia specialists, but only one JavaScript specialist. Team B has an equal number of Python and Javascript specialists, but no Julia specialists. Team C has five more Python specialists than Julia specialists, and an equal number of JavaScript specialists as team A.\n\nGiven the following facts:\n1. There are 25 total specialists in all three teams combined.\n2. The number of Julia specialists is a prime number.\n3. No two teams have the same set of specialists (one language per team).\n4. Every team has at least one specialist.\n5. Each specialist can only belong to one team. \n6. There are no more than 10 specialists in any single team.\n\nQuestion: How many specialists are there in each team?\n\n\nFirst, we'll represent the number of Python, Julia, and JavaScript specialists in teams A, B, and C as `a`, `j`, and `c` respectively. Based on the given facts, we can formulate the following equations:\n1. a + j + c = 25 (equation from fact 1)\n2. a = 2j (from fact 3 that Team A has twice as many Python specialists as Julia specialists)\n3. b = p (from fact 4 and 5 that team B has only Python specialists)\n4. c = a + 5j (from fact 4 that Team C has five more Python specialists than Julia specialists, and an equal number of JavaScript specialists as team A)\nSubstitute equation 2 into equation 4 to get `c` in terms of `j`.\n5. c = 3j + 5 (equation from step 4)\nNow substitute the expressions for `a`, `b`, and `c` from equations 1, 2, and 5 into equation 6. This will give you two equations involving only `j`, which we can solve to find the number of Julia specialists:\n6. a + j + c = 25\n7. 3j + 5 + j + p = 25 (substitute c in terms of j from step 5)\n8. 4j + p = 20 \nSubtract equation 7 from equation 1, we get `2p - 2j = 15`. Substitute the expression for `p` from fact 4 into this equation to solve for `j`, which is a prime number:\n9. j = 3 (since p can be any non-negative integer less than 10)\nSubstitute the value of `j` in equation 6, we get `a + c = 20`. Substitute the expressions for `c` from step 5 into this equation to solve for `a`, and then substitute `a` into equation 2:\n10. a = 16 (from equation 9)\n11. j = 3 (from fact 4 that Team B has only Python specialists)\nFinally, substitute the values of `j` and `a` from steps 10 and 11 into equation 5 to solve for `c`, which is equivalent to team C's number of JavaScript specialists:\n12. c = 19 (from step 10)\nAnswer: There are 16 Python specialists in Team A, 3 Julia specialists in both Teams B and C, and 19 JavaScript specialists in Team C.","status":200,"tokens":[91,925],"elapsed":25.222848167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
