Here's a solution to count the number of rows in each group based on the `model` column:\n```julia\n# Define a function to group and count rows by model\ncount_model_rows(df_cars) = groups(df_cars, by => model) do (group)\n    length(group)\nend\n```\nIn this solution, we use the `groups` function to group the DataFrame based on the `model` column. The `do` block is used to execute a function for each group, which in this case is `length(group)`. This will return the number of rows in each group.\n\nYou can call this function by passing in your `df_cars` DataFrame, like so:\n```julia\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis will return a dataframe with the count of rows for each model.\n\nNote: In case you're wondering about the syntax, `groups(df_cars, by => model)` is a shorthand way of writing `groups(df_cars, ByRef => model)`. The `ByRef` keyword is used to specify that the `model` column should be passed by reference. This allows us to manipulate the column within the `groups` function without creating a new copy of the DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[90,291],"elapsed":9.851994334,"_type":"aimessage"}]
