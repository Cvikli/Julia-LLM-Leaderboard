Here's how you can define the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia using DataFrames, Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    groups = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    counts = Statistics.mode.(eachcol(size.(groups))) .+ 0 # Adding 1 to handle empty groups\n    return DataFrame(Model = names(groups), Count = vector(counts))\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a single argument `df_cars`, which is the `DataFrame` containing the car data. It uses the `groupby` function from `DataFrames` to group the rows based on their `model` column. The `size` function is then used to find the number of rows in each group, and these numbers are stored as a vector `counts`. Finally, the `Statistics.mode` function is used with `eachcol` to calculate the mode (i.e., most frequent value) for the size of each group, which corresponds to the number of rows. The results are then returned in a new `DataFrame`, with columns named \"Model\" and \"Count\".","status":200,"tokens":[55,284],"elapsed":15.447435417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
