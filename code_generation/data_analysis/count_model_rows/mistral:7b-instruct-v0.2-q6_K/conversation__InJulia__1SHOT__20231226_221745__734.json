Here's how you can define the function `count_model_rows`:\n\n```julia using DataFrames, Statistics\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n  groups = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n  counts = statistics(groups, :size)\n\n  result = DataFrame(Model = names(counts), Count = vec(values(counts)))\n  return result\nend\n``\n\nThe `groupby` function groups the data in `df_cars` by the column named \"model\", and returns a `Grouping` object. The `statistics` function is then used to compute the size of each group, resulting in an array called `counts`. This array contains the number of rows for each unique model value.\n\nThe result is stored as a new DataFrame, with columns named \"Model\" and \"Count\", which represent the unique car models and their respective row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[55,243],"elapsed":13.173279125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
