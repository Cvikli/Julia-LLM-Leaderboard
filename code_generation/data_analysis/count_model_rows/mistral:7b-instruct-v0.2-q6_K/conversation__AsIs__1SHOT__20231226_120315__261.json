Here's how you can do it using Python and the pandas library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a DataFrame as an argument and returns a Series showing the count of rows for each unique model in the DataFrame.\n    \"\"\"\n    return df['model'].value_counts()\n\n# Assuming df_cars is defined as you described\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe `count_model_rows` function accepts a DataFrame as an argument, and it uses the `value_counts()` method from pandas to group the data by model and return a Series with the counts. You can call this function by passing your DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument:\n\n```python\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(result)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[52,261],"elapsed":14.2248615,"_type":"aimessage"}]
