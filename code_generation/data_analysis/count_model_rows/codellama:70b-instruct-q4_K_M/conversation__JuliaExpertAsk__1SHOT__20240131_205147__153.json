The `groupby` function groups the data frame by model, and the pipe operator (`|>`) passes it to the `combine` function which calculates the number of rows (`nrow`). Finally, it assigns the result to the new column `:num_of_rows`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":10.924161656,"_type":"aimessage"}]
