Then it defines a function called `count_model_rows`, which groups the data by the `model` column and calculates the number of rows for each model. Finally, it applies the `count_model_rows` function to the DataFrame `df_cars` using `combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow)` which is a short form of `combine(groupby(df, :model), count)`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,243],"elapsed":13.025777957,"_type":"aimessage"}]
