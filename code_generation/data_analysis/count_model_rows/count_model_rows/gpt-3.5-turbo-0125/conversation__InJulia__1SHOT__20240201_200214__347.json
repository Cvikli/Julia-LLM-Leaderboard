Here is an example of how you can write the `count_model_rows` function in Julia using the DataFrames package:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    counts = combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow)\n    return counts\nend\n```\n\nYou can then call this function with your `df_cars` DataFrame to get the counts of rows for each model.\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\"])\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\nThis will give you a new DataFrame with two columns: `model` and `nrow` where `nrow` represents the count of rows for each distinct model in the original DataFrame `df_cars`.","status":200,"tokens":[54,174],"elapsed":1.503120083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
