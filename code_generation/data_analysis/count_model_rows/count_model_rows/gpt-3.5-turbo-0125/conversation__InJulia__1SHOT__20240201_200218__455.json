Here's an example code snippet in Julia that demonstrates how to achieve this task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Create a sample DataFrame\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model = [\"Toyota\", \"Toyota\", \"Honda\", \"Ford\", \"Ford\", \"Honda\"])\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df)\n    model_counts = combine(groupby(df, :model), nrow)\n    return model_counts\nend\n\n# Call the function with the DataFrame\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the `count_model_rows` function takes a DataFrame as input, groups the data by the 'model' column, and then calculates the number of rows for each unique 'model'. The `combine` function is used to perform the aggregation, and the result is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[54,166],"elapsed":1.482630167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
