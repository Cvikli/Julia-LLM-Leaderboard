Here's an example of how you can write the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    model_counts = by(df_cars, :model, count=:model => length)\n    return model_counts\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `by(df_cars, :model, count=:model => length)` groups the data in `df_cars` by the `model` column and counts the number of rows for each group.\n- The result is stored in the `model_counts` DataFrame, where each row represents a unique model and the count of rows for that model.\n- Finally, the function returns the `model_counts` DataFrame.\n\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame `df_cars` to get the count of rows for each model group.","status":200,"tokens":[54,186],"elapsed":1.35656075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
