Here's an example function `count_model_rows` that should do what you've described:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\nusing DataFramesMeta\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    @linq df |>\n        groupby(:model) |>\n        combine(nrows = length(:model))\nend\n```\n\nYou can then call the function `count_model_rows(df_cars)` with your DataFrame `df_cars` as the input to get the result you're looking for. This code snippet leverages the power of DataFrames and DataFramesMeta to group the data by the `model` column and calculate the number of rows for each distinct model.","status":200,"tokens":[54,164],"elapsed":1.835750208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
