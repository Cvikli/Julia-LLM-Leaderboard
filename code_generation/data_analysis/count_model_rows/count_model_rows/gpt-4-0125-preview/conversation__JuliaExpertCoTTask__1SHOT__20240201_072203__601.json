Based on the input, the expected output should show the models \"a4\" with 3 occurrences, \"a6\" with 1 occurrence, and \"q7\" with 1 occurrence.\n\nPlease, make sure you have the `DataFrames` package installed and imported to run this Julia code successfully.","status":200,"tokens":[179,354],"elapsed":24.809814,"_type":"aimessage"}]
