Return the result as a DataFrame.\n\n### Write any functions and other code you need\n\nTo implement the function `count_model_rows`, we need to:\n- Use the DataFrame grouping and aggregation capabilities provided by the appropriate Julia library (DataFrames.jl).\n\nMake sure to have DataFrames.jl installed and imported to use DataFrame functions.\n\n```julia\n# Necessary import\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Grouping by model and counting rows\n    count_df = combine(groupby(df_cars, :model), nrow => :count)\n    return count_df\nend\n```\n\n### Solve the task\n\nGiven the data:\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n```\n\nWhen we apply our function:\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\n\n### Check that your solution is correct\n\nThe expected output should be a DataFrame showing each model and the count of rows for that model. Specifically, for the provided data, the result should look something like this:\n\n```\n│ model │ count │\n├───────┼───────┤\n│ a4    │ 3     │\n│ a6    │ 1     │\n│ q7    │ 1     │\n```\n\nThis output indicates there are 3 occurrences of model \"a4\", 1 occurrence of model \"a6\", and 1 occurrence of model \"q7\".","status":200,"tokens":[179,368],"elapsed":26.683532458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
