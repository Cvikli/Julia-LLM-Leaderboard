Below you will find a Python function `count_model_rows` that takes a DataFrame `df_cars` with a column named `model` and returns a Series with the count of rows for each `model`.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    # Group the DataFrame by the 'model' column and count the number of occurrences\n    model_counts = df_cars.groupby('model').size()\n    \n    # Return the count Series\n    return model_counts\n\n# Sample usage:\n# Assuming df_cars is a pre-existing DataFrame with a 'model' column.\n\n# df_cars = pd.DataFrame({\n#     'model': ['Model S', 'Model X', 'Model 3', 'Model S', 'Model 3'],\n#     'year': [2020, 2019, 2021, 2020, 2021],\n#     'price': [80000, 90000, 40000, 85000, 42000]\n# })\n\n# result = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n# print(result)\n```\n\nThis function utilizes the Pandas library's `groupby` function to group the rows based on unique values in the `model` column and then uses `size` to count the number of rows for each model. It returns the resulting `Series` with the model names as the index and their respective counts as the values.","status":200,"tokens":[51,293],"elapsed":11.572663166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
