Below is a Python function `count_model_rows` that uses the pandas library to group the data in the DataFrame `df_cars` by the `model` column and then calculates the number of rows for each model. The function returns a Series with the count of rows for each model.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\n    # Group the DataFrame by the 'model' column and count the number of rows for each group\n    model_counts = df_cars.groupby('model').size()\n    return model_counts\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming df_cars is a DataFrame that has already been defined and contains a 'model' column\n# model_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n# print(model_counts)\n```\n\nWhen you call the `count_model_rows` function and pass the `df_cars` DataFrame to it, it will return a pandas Series where the index is the unique models and the values are the counts of rows for each model.\n\nPlease note that you need to have pandas installed in your Python environment to use this function. If you haven't installed pandas yet, you can do so using `pip install pandas`.","status":200,"tokens":[51,241],"elapsed":30.659960834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
