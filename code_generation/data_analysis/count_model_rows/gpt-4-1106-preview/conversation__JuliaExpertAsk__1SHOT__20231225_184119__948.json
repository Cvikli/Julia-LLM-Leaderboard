Here is a function `count_model_rows` that accomplishes this using the Julia language:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Define the function count_model_rows\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group the DataFrame by the 'model' column\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, :model)\n    \n    # Count the number of rows for each group (model)\n    count_rows = combine(grouped, nrow => :count)\n    return count_rows\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a DataFrame `df_cars` with a column `model`, groups the data by `model`, and then calculates the count of rows in each group, returning a new DataFrame with these counts. The `combine` function applies a transformation (`nrow`) to each group and names the result column as `:count`.","status":200,"tokens":[89,175],"elapsed":9.854918709,"_type":"aimessage"}]
