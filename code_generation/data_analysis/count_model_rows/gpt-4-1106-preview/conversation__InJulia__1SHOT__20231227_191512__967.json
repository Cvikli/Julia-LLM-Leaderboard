The `combine` function is then used to compute the number of rows in each group, which is represented by the `nrow` function, and the result is stored in a new column named `count`.\n\nHere's how you would use this function:\n\n```julia\n# Assuming df_cars is a DataFrame with a column named 'model'\nmodel_counts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\n\n# model_counts will now be a DataFrame with two columns: 'model' and 'count'\n```\n\nMake sure you have the `DataFrames` package installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using Julia's package manager with the following command:\n\n```julia\nimport Pkg\nPkg.add(\"DataFrames\")\n```\n\nThen, you can include the above function in your Julia script or REPL session and call it with your `DataFrame`.","status":200,"tokens":[54,382],"elapsed":32.391137542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
