It iterates through each row of the DataFrame using `eachrow(df)`, extracts the model from each row, and updates the counts in the dictionary. Finally, it constructs a new DataFrame containing the model names with their corresponding count of rows and returns it.","status":200,"tokens":[205,187],"elapsed":5.47300525,"_type":"aimessage"}]
