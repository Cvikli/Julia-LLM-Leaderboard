The example code above fills `models` and `cars` with random values between 1 and 9 for demonstration purposes only. In your actual use case, replace `rand(1..9)` with appropriate method to fill the data with real car model information.\n\nAlso remember that this function returns a DataFrame where each row represents a unique car model, and its count in the input DataFrame. The result will be sorted by the models' names (as they appear in the `models` array).","status":200,"tokens":[60,357],"elapsed":9.226743,"_type":"aimessage"}]
