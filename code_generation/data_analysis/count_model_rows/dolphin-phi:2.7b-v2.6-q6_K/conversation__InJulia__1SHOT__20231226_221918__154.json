Then we use `collect` and `countmap` to count the number of rows in each group. The resulting counts are stored in a dictionary, which is then returned by the function. \n\nThis approach works well with the default behavior of `groupby`, but it's important to note that the output will not have keys for missing or duplicate models. If you want to handle these cases more gracefully, you may need to add additional logic to your function. For example, you might use a different grouping strategy (e.g., using a hash table instead of `groupby`), or you could modify `countmap` to handle keys that are not present in the data set.","status":200,"tokens":[60,373],"elapsed":9.579897125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
