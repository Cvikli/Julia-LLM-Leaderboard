Here's how you might write the `count_model_rows` function:\n\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\ncounts = Dict{String, Int}()\n\nfor (model, _row) in eachgroup(df, \"model\")\npush!(counts[model], length(df))\nend\n\nreturn counts\nend\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating over each row of the DataFrame `df`, with each row being represented as a pair (model, row). For each model, it increments the count for that model in an integer array stored at the key \"model\". Finally, it returns the dictionary `counts`, which maps each unique model to its corresponding count.\n\nThis function assumes that `df` is a DataFrame with a column called \"model\" and no missing values. If your DataFrame has missing values or other types of data, you may need to adjust the function accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[97,233],"elapsed":6.225728959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
