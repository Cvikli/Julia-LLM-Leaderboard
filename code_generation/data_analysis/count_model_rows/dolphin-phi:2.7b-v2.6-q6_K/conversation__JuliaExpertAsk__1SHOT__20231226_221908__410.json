Here's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df_cars):\nreturn df_cars.groupby('model')['model'].count()\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input and uses the `groupby` method to group the data by the 'model' column. Then, it applies the `size` function to count the number of rows for each unique value in the 'model' column. Finally, it returns the result as a Series.\n\nYou can use this function like this:\n```python\ndf_cars = pd.DataFrame({\n'model': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'A']\n})\n\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(result)# Output: 03\n#12\n#21\n# Name: model, dtype: int64\n```\n\nIn this example, the 'count_model_rows' function will return a Series with three unique values corresponding to the models in the DataFrame, and their respective row counts.","status":200,"tokens":[97,301],"elapsed":7.927269791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
