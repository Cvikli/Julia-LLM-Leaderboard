Then it counts how many times each model name appears in this collection. This gives you the count of rows for each model in your DataFrame. \n\nThe usage would be:\n\n```julia\ndf_cars = DataFrame([{1, 'modelA'}, {2, 'modelB'}, {3, 'modelA'}, {4, 'modelC'}], [Float64, String])\ncounts = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln!(\"Count of model rows: %b\", counts)\n```\n\nThe output will be a collection of the counts for each model in your DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[97,228],"elapsed":6.066905625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
