If not, you can install it using pip:\n```python\npip install pandas\n```\n\nNow, here's the solution:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef count_model_rows(df):\n    # Ensure that df is a DataFrame\n    if not isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame):\n        print(\"Please provide a valid DataFrame\")\n        return None\n\n    # Check if 'model' column exists in the DataFrame\n    if 'model' not in df.columns:\n        print(\"The 'model' column does not exist in the DataFrame\")\n        return None\n\n    # Group data by 'model' and calculate row counts\n    model_counts = df.groupby('model').size()\n    \n    return model_counts\n```\nYou can use this function like this:\n```python\n# Assuming df_cars is your DataFrame\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprint(result)\n```\nThis will print the number of rows for each model. If a model doesn't exist in the DataFrame, it won't be included in the output. \n\nNote: This function assumes that 'model' is the name of the column you want to group by. If it has a different name, you should adjust accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[69,320],"elapsed":41.416044875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
