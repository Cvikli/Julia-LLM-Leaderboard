We will first load this package and then define our function `count_model_rows`. This function will take a dataframe as input and return a new dataframe with model and its count.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\n# Define the function\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return by(df, :model, nrow)\nend\n\n# Create a dataframe\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n\n# Call the function\ncount_model_rows(df_cars)\n```\nThis code will first group the input data frame by the `model` column and then calculate the number of rows for each group using the `nrow` function. The result is a new dataframe with two columns, `model` and `nrow`, where the `nrow` column contains the counts for each model.\n\nWhen you run this code with the provided example data, it will return a dataframe like this:\n\n```\n2×2 DataFrame\n│ Row │ model │ nrow │\n├─────┼-------┼------┤\n│ 1   │ \"a4\"  │ 3    │\n│ 2   │ \"a6\"  │ 1    │\n│ 3   │ \"q7\"  │ 1    │\n```","status":200,"tokens":[222,331],"elapsed":67.047358458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
