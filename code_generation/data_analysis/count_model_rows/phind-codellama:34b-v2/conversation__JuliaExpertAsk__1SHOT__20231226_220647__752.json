The assumption here is that your DataFrame `df_cars` is already defined and it has a column called `model`.\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return by(df, :model, nrow)\nend\n```\nYou can then call this function with your DataFrame as follows:\n\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will print a new DataFrame where the first column is the `model` and the second column is the count of rows for each model. The `by` function in Julia's DataFrames package allows you to perform split-apply operations on your data, here we are splitting the data by `model` and applying the `nrow` function to get the number of rows in each group.","status":200,"tokens":[111,217],"elapsed":29.382199167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
