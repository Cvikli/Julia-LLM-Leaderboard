Then we use `combine` to calculate the number of rows in each group with the `nrow` function. The result will be a new dataframe where each row corresponds to a unique model and the count of rows for that model.\n\nNote: This is assuming your DataFrame has a column called `:model`. Replace `:model` with the name of the column you want to group by if it's different.","status":200,"tokens":[71,258],"elapsed":33.65999725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
