This can be done using the `groupby` function in combination with the `nrow` function.\n\nFirst, let's define the DataFrame:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"a4\", \"q7\", \"a4\"])\n```\nNow let's create the function `count_model_rows`:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df::DataFrame)\n    return groupby(df, :model) |>\n           combine(nrow) |>\n           sort!(_, :model)\nend\n```\nThis function first groups the data by the `:model` column, then combines each group into a single row with the number of rows in that group (using `nrow`). Finally, it sorts the resulting DataFrame by the `:model` column.\n\nNow we can call this function on our `df_cars`:\n```julia\nresult = count_model_rows(df_cars)\nprintln(result)\n```\nThis will print:\n```\n3×2 DataFrames.DataFrame\n│ Row │ model   │ nrow  │\n├─────┼─────────┼───────┤\n│ 1   │ \"a4\"    │ 3     │\n│ 2   │ \"a6\"    │ 1     │\n│ 3   │ \"q7\"    │ 1     │\n```\nThis indicates that there are 3 rows with the model \"a4\", 1 row with the model \"a6\", and 1 row with the model \"q7\".","status":200,"tokens":[222,387],"elapsed":53.085499667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
