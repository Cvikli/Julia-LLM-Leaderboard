Here is a possible implementation of the `count_model_rows` function in Julia:\n```julia\nfunction count_model_rows(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Group the data by model\n    grouped = groupby(df_cars, df_cars.model)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of rows for each model\n    counts = map(g -> length(g), grouped)\n    \n    return counts\nend\n```\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars` as input and returns an array of integers representing the number of rows in each group. The `groupby()` function is used to group the data by the `model` column, and the `length()` function is used to calculate the number of rows in each group.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[90,187],"elapsed":6.456240042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
