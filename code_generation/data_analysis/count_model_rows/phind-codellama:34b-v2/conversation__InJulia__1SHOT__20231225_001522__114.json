For each model in the original dataframe, it groups the data by that model, counts the number of rows for that group using `nrow`, and then combines this into a single DataFrame. Finally, it renames the `:nrow` column to `:count` for clarity.","status":200,"tokens":[71,287],"elapsed":37.277471625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
