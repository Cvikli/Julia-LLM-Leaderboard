For instance, `df_cars[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'audi') & (df_cars['model'] == 'a4')]` returns the subset of only rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model \"a4\".\n# \n# **Hint:** You can use `.loc[]` to set values in a column. For example, `df_cars.loc[:,'col_name'] = value`. This changes all values in col_name to the single value provided. In this case, it would change all the values of \"audi_a4\" to True.\n# \n# **Hint:** Use `|` for or and `~` to invert a boolean condition. So not (df_cars['model'] == 'a4') inverts the condition so you get only the rows where df_cars['model'] is not equal to \"a4\".\n# \n# **Hint:** You can use `.isin()` for multiple conditions on a column. For example, `df_cars[df_cars['manufacturer'].isin(['audi', 'bmw']) & df_cars['model'] == 'a4']` would return all rows where model is \"a4\" and the manufacturer equals either \"audi\" or \"bmw\".\n# \n# **Hint:** Don't forget to return your DataFrame!\n# \n# ## Hint 2 - Using `.loc()` to add a column and use multiple conditions in boolean filtering.\n# \n# You can also use `.loc[]` to set values when using it for adding new columns or editing existing ones.
