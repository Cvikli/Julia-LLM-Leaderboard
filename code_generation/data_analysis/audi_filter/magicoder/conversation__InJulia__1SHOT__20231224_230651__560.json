Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then adds a new column named `audi_a4_type` that is always `true`.\n\nPlease note, this code assumes you have imported necessary packages like DataFrames for working with dataframes.\n\nIf you want to use this function, call it as follows:\n```julia\ndf_result = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[112,270],"elapsed":8.543927583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
