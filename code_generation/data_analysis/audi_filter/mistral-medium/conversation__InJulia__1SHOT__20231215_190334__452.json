Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

The `.&&` and `.||` operators are used for element-wise logical AND and OR operations, respectively.","status":200,"tokens":[110,299],"elapsed":25.089387916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
