Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Finally, the resulting DataFrame is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[99,150],"elapsed":3.022067375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
