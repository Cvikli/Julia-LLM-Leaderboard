Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Additionally, you can test the function with different inputs to ensure it behaves as expected in all cases.","status":200,"tokens":[332,362],"elapsed":16.160150875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
