Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here's a function `audi_filter` that meets your requirements:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter the DataFrame to only include rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4 or \"a4 quattro\"\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    \n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` and set its value to `true` for all rows\n    filtered_df[:, :audi_a4_type] = true\n    \n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\nThis function will take in the DataFrame `df_cars` as an argument, filter the rows based on the conditions you mentioned, and create a new column with all values set to `true`. It returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[160,218],"elapsed":7.368289042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
