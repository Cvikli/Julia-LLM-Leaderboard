Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

You can use boolean indexing for this.\n\nStep 2: Create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows, as required by the task. You can use the `assign()` function to create this column.\n\nHere's the code to implement these steps:\n\n```python\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    # Step 1: Filter the DataFrame to only include rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n    df_cars_filtered = df_cars[\n        (df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'audi') &\n        ((df_cars['model'] == 'a4') | (df_cars['model'] == 'a4 quattro'))]\n    \n    # Step 2: Create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.\n    df_cars_filtered = df_cars_filtered.assign(audi_a4_type=True)\n    \n    return df_cars_filtered\n```\n\nTo check the correctness of your solution, you can call `audi_filter(df_cars)` with the given `DataFrame`. The returned DataFrame should have only rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", and a new column `audi_a4_type` with `True` values across all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[340,400],"elapsed":14.071901041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
