It then creates a new column `audi_a4_type` and sets its value to `True` for all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nYou can use this function on your DataFrame by calling `audi_filter(df_cars)`, where `df_cars` is your DataFrame variable.","status":200,"tokens":[109,232],"elapsed":3.244750625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
