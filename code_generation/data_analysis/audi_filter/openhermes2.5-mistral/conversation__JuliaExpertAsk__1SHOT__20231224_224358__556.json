Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nFirst, we'll define the `audi_filter` function and then apply it to the `df_cars` DataFrame. Here's how you can do this:\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    model_filters = [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]\n    df_audi = filter((rows -> rows[\"manufacturer\"] == \"audi\" && any.(Ref(model_filters) .== rows[\"model\"])), df)\n    return DataFrame(df_audi, [:audi_a4_type => true])\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, we define the `model_filters` array that contains all possible Audi A4 models. Then, we filter the DataFrame `df` using a composite filter condition:\n- The \"manufacturer\" column should equal \"audi\".\n- The \"model\" column should be in the `model_filters` array.\n\nIf any of these conditions are true for a row, the row is kept in the resulting DataFrame. After that, we add a new column called `audi_a4_type` to the DataFrame with all values set to `true`. Finally, we return the modified DataFrame.\n\nNow you can apply this function to your `df_cars` DataFrame like this:\n```julia\nresulting_df = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[158,327],"elapsed":10.631655833,"_type":"aimessage"}]
