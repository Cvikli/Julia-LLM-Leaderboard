Here is a function that accomplishes the task:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    # Filter down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”\n    audi_rows = df_cars[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'audi') & ((df_cars['model'] == 'a4') | (df_cars['model'] == 'a4 quattro'))]\n    \n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals true across all rows\n    audi_rows['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return audi_rows\n```\n\nThis function takes in a DataFrame `df_cars` as input, filters the data according to your criteria and then adds a new column with the value of `True` for all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[114,230],"elapsed":7.444703625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
