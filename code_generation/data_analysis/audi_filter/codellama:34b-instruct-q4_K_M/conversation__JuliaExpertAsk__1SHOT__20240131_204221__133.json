Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to write the function:\n```\ndef audi_filter(df):\n    df = df[df[\"manufacturer\"] == \"audi\"]\n    df[\"model\"] = np.where((df[\"model\"] == \"a4\") | (df[\"model\"] == \"a4 quattro\"), True, False)\n    return df\n```\nThis function first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\". Then it creates a new column `model` that is true for all rows where the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\", and false otherwise. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,143],"elapsed":3.922651395,"_type":"aimessage"}]
