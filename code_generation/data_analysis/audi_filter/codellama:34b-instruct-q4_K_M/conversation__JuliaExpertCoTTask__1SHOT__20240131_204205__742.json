Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\naudi_filter(df_cars)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# My solution:\ndef audi_filter(df):\n    return df[df.manufacturer == \"audi\"] & (df.model.isin([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]))\n\n# Explanation:\nThe function `audi_filter` takes a DataFrame as input and returns a new DataFrame that contains only the rows with manufacturer \"audi\" and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". The function first filters the DataFrame using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to select the rows where the value in the \"manufacturer\" column is equal to \"audi\", then it uses the `isin` method to filter the DataFrame again and return only the rows where the value in the \"model\" column is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Finally, the function returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,185],"elapsed":5.11023503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
