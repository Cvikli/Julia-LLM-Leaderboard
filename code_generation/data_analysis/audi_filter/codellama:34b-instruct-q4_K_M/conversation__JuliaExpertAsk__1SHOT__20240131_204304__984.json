Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to do it:\n```\ndef audi_filter(df):\n    return df[df[\"manufacturer\"] == \"audi\" & (df[\"model\"].str.contains(\"a4|a4 quattro\"))].assign(\n        audi_a4_type=lambda x: True\n    )\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. We first filter the DataFrame using the `manufacturer` column and check if it's equal to \"audi\".\n2. Then, we use the `.str.contains()` method to check if the `model` column contains either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". The `|` symbol is used for pattern matching in regular expressions, so it will match any string that contains either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n3. We then use the `.assign()` method to create a new column called `audi_a4_type`, and set its value to `True` across all rows.\n4. Finally, we return the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,223],"elapsed":6.127119106,"_type":"aimessage"}]
