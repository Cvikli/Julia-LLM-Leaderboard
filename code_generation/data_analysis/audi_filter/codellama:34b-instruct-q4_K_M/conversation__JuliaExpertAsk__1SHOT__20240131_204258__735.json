Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to do it:\n```\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"Audi\" && (row.model == \"A4\" || row.model == \"A4 Quattro\"), df)\n    transform!(df, :audi_a4_type => ByRow(!ismissing))\nend\n```\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. The function takes in a DataFrame `df` as an argument and uses the `filter` method to filter down the rows where the manufacturer is \"Audi\" and the model is either \"A4\" or \"A4 Quattro\".\n2. The `transform!` method is then used to add a new column called `audi_a4_type` that takes on the value of `true` for all rows.\n3. The resulting DataFrame is returned from the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,205],"elapsed":5.63189018,"_type":"aimessage"}]
