Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's one way to do it:\n```\ndef audi_filter(df):\n    # Filter down to only Audi cars with model \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    df = df[df['manufacturer'] == 'audi'] & (df['model'] == 'a4' | df['model'] == 'a4 quattro')]\n    \n    # Create a new column called \"audi_a4_type\" and set it to true for all rows\n    df['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return df\n```\nThis function first filters down the input DataFrame `df` to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then creates a new column called \"audi_a4_type\" and sets it to true for all rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nYou can call this function by passing in your `df_cars` DataFrame like this:\n```\nresult = audi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,240],"elapsed":6.597519837,"_type":"aimessage"}]
