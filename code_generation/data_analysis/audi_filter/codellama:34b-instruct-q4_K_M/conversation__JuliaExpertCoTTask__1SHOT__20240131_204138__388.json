Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Think through the approach step by step:\n\t* Identify the filtering criteria for the DataFrame (manufacturer = \"audi\" and model in (\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\")).\n\t* Create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.\n\t* Return the resulting DataFrame.\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    df = filter(row -> row[:manufacturer] == \"audi\" && (row[:model] == \"a4\" || row[:model] == \"a4 quattro\"), df)\n    df.audi_a4_type = true\n    return df\nend\n```\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* The function `audi_filter` takes a DataFrame as input and applies the filtering criteria to it.\n\t* The `filter` function is used to filter down the dataset to only the rows that match the manufacturer \"audi\" and model in (\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\").\n\t* A new column `audi_a4_type` is created and set to `true` across all rows.\n\t* The resulting DataFrame is returned.\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\t* Test the function with the provided DataFrame `df_cars`.\n\t* Verify that the resulting DataFrame has 7 rows (1 for each \"audi\" model) and the new column `audi_a4_type` has `true` values for all rows.","status":200,"tokens":[0,350],"elapsed":9.726453154,"_type":"aimessage"}]
