Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here is an example of how you could write a function to filter the `df_cars` dataset based on the manufacturer and model columns:\n```\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quadro\"\n    df_filtered = df[df.manufacturer .== \"audi\" && df.model .in_( \"a4\", \"a4 quadro\")]\n    \n    # Create a new column indicating the rows are filtered\n    df_filtered[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    \n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\nYou can then call the `audi_filter` function and pass in the original `df_cars` dataset to see the resulting filtered DataFrame:\n```\noriginal_df = # Load your original DataFrame here\nfiltered_df = audi_filter(original_df)\n```\nI hope this helps!
