Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here is the function you requested:\n```julia\n audi_filter(df_cars) =\n    filter(Row -> manufacturer == \"audi\" && model in {\"a4\", \"a4 Quattro\"}, df_cars) .+\n    create_column(df_cars, \"udi_a4_type\", true)\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `filter()` is a built-in function that performs row-level filtering. It takes a logical expression as its argument, and returns a new DataFrame containing only the rows that satisfy the expression.\n* In this case, we use the `Row` type to specify that we want to filter based on the values in the `manufacturer` and `model` columns. The `manufacturer` column must be equal to \"audi\", and the `model` column must be either \"a4\" or \"a4 Quattro\".\n* The `.+` operator is used to add a new column to the original DataFrame. In this case, we create a new column called `udi_a4_type` and set its value to `true` across all rows.\n\nWith this function, you can apply the filter and create the new column like this:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\naudi_filter(df_cars)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[141,292],"elapsed":10.499502167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
