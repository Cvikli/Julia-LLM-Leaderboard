Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Let's get started. Here is my approach to solving this problem:\n\n1. Think through the approach step by step:\n\t* Filter the rows where manufacturer is \"audi\"\n\t* Filter the rows where model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quadro\"\n\t* Create a new column \"udi_a4_type\" that equals true across all rows\n\t* Return the resulting DataFrame\n2. Write any functions and other code needed:\n\t* `audi_filter()` function to filter the DataFrame based on manufacturer and model columns\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* `df_cars` is the input DataFrame\n\t* `audi_filter()` function is called on `df_cars` to filter the rows as described above\n\t* The resulting DataFrame is returned\n4. Check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the new column \"udi_a4_type\" contains true across all rows for manufacturer \"audi\" and model \"a4\" or \"a4 quadro\"\n\t* Verify that no rows are left in the resulting DataFrame that do not meet the filter conditions\n\nHere is the implemented `audi_filter()` function:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df)\n    # Filter rows where manufacturer is \"audi\"\n    filtered_df = df[df.manufacturer .== \"audi\"]\n    \n    # Filter rows where model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quadro\"\n    filtered_df = filtered_df[filtered_df.model .inclusive contains \"a4\" || filtered_df.model .inclusive contains \"a4 quadro\"]\n    \n    # Create new column \"udi_a4_type\" that equals true across all rows\n    filtered_df['udi_a4_type'] = true\n    \n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[1,438],"elapsed":15.433892542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
