Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here's my solution to the task:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter rows with manufacturer \"audi\"\n    audi_rows = df.manufacturer .== \"audi\"\n\n    # Filter rows with model being \"a4 or a4 quattro\"\n    a4_rows = df.model .contains(\"a4\") .or .contains(\"a4 quarto\")\n\n    # Create new column \"audi_a4_type\" and set it to true across all rows\n    audi_a4_type = true .* (audi_rows .& a4_rows)\n\n    # Return resulting DataFrame\n    return df .|> audi_rows .|> a4_rows .|> audi_a4_type\nend\n```\nLet me explain how the code works:\n\n1. We define the `audi_filter` function, which takes in a DataFrame `df` as input.\n2. We use the `.==` operator to filter out rows where the manufacturer is not \"audi\". This gives us a new DataFrame ` audi_rows`.\n3. Next, we use the `.contains()` operator to filter out rows where the model does not contain \"a4\" or \"a4 quarto\". This gives us a new DataFrame `a4_rows`.\n4. We use the bitwise `.*` operator to create a new column `audi_a4_type`, which is set to true across all rows in both `audi_rows` and `a4_rows`.\n5. Finally, we use the pipe operator `|>` to combine the filtered rows from `audi_rows` and `a4_rows` into a single DataFrame, which is returned as the output of the function.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to explain anything else!","status":200,"tokens":[1,419],"elapsed":14.706146584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
