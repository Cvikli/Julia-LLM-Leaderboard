X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a DataFrame `df_cars` with car data with columns `manufacturer` and `model`.

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - DataFrames: filtering, creating new columns, selecting rows based on conditions\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n  filtered_df = filter(df_cars, [:manufacturer .== \"audi\"; :model .in([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])])\n  new_column = map!(x -> true, eachrow(filtered_df))\n  renamed_new_column = [(:audi_a4_type, new_column)]\n  new_columns = hcat(df_cars.cols, renamed_new_column...)\n  DataFrame(new_columns)\nend\n```\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - This function takes a `DataFrame` as an argument and filters it based on manufacturer being \"audi\" and model being either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". It then creates a new column called \"audi_a4_type\" with a `true` value for all the filtered rows. Finally, it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[418,298],"elapsed":11.482327125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
