The given DataFrame `df_cars` is first filtered using a row predicate to select only rows having manufacturer \"audi\" and model as either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, a new DataFrame is created with the same filtered rows and an additional column `audi_a4_type` set to `true` for all of them. Finally, the function returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[110,316],"elapsed":10.209040917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
