Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Then we create a new column `audi_a4_type` and set it to `true` for all rows in the filtered DataFrame. Finally, the function returns the resulting DataFrame.\n\nYou can replace `df_cars` with your actual DataFrame that you are working with in your code.","status":200,"tokens":[102,254],"elapsed":2.331769333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
