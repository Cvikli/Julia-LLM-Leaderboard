Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here's a code snippet in Julia that achieves what you are looking for:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> (row.manufacturer == \"audi\") && (row.model in [\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), df_cars)\n    filtered_df[!, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nYou can call the `audi_filter` function passing your `df_cars` DataFrame as an argument, and it will return the filtered DataFrame with the additional `audi_a4_type` column set to `true`.","status":200,"tokens":[102,134],"elapsed":1.114897875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
