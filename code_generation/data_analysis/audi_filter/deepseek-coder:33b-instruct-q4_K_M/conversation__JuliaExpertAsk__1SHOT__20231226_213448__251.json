Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Below is a Python function using Pandas library that fulfills your requirements.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df_cars):\n    # Filter the dataframe to only rows where manufacturer is \"audi\" and model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n    df = df_cars[(df_cars['manufacturer'] == 'audi') & ((df_cars['model'] == 'a4') | (df_cars['model'] == 'a4 quattro'))]\n    \n    # Create a new column named \"audi_a4_type\" and set it to True for all rows.\n    df[\"audi_a4_type\"] = True\n    \n    return df\n```\n\nThe function first filters the DataFrame `df_cars` to only include rows where 'manufacturer' is 'audi' and 'model' is either 'a4' or 'a4 quattro'. The filtered dataframe is stored in `df`. Then a new column named `audi_a4_type` is created and set to True for all the rows of the filtered DataFrame.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that your DataFrame has columns 'manufacturer' and 'model', and these are case-sensitive. If they may have different cases, you should convert them to a common case (like lowercase) before comparing.","status":200,"tokens":[159,317],"elapsed":54.439590125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
