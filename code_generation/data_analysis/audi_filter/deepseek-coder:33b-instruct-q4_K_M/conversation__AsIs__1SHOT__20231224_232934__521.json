Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by using pandas dataframe filtering and boolean indexing. The function `audi_filter` will look like the following:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef audi_filter(df):\n    # Filter rows where manufacturer is 'audi' and model is either 'a4' or 'a4 quattro'\n    df = df[(df['manufacturer'] == 'audi') & ((df['model'] == 'a4') | (df['model'] == 'a4 quattro'))]\n    \n    # Create a new column 'audi_a4_type' and set it to True for all rows\n    df['audi_a4_type'] = True\n    \n    return df\n```\nThis function works by first filtering the DataFrame `df` such that only rows with manufacturer as “audi” and model either as 'a4' or 'a4 quattro' are kept. Then it creates a new column `audi_a4_type` in the filtered DataFrame, where all values are set to True. Finally it returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[115,246],"elapsed":42.212409458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
