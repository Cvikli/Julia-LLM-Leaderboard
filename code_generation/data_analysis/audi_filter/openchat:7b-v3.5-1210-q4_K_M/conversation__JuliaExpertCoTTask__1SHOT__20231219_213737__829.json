Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Let's get started.\n\nHere is the code for the `udi_filter` function:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter rows with manufacturer \"audi\"\n    audi_rows = df[\"manufacturer\"] .== \"audi\"\n\n    # Filter rows with model being \"a4 or \"a4 quattro\"\n    a4_rows = df[\"model\"] .inclusive (\"a4\") .|| df[\"model\"] .inclusive (\"a4 quadrou\")\n\n    # Create a new column \"udi_a4_type\" with value true across all rows\n    audi_a4_type = true .* (audi_rows .& a4_rows)\n\n    # Return the resulting DataFrame\n    return df .* audi_a4_type\nend\n```\nLet me explain how the code works:\n\n1. We define the `audi_filter` function, which takes a `DataFrame` argument `df`.\n2. First, we filter the rows based on the manufacturer. We use the bitwise `and` operator `.&` to combine the two filters.\n3. Next, we filter the rows based on the model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quadrou\". Again, we use the bitwise `inclusive` operator `.inclusive` to create a set of rows that match either condition.\n4. Finally, we create a new column called `udi_a4_type` and set its value to `true` across all rows. This is done using the bitwise `and` operator `.*`.\n5. We return the resulting DataFrame, which now contains only the rows that meet both filters.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[1,392],"elapsed":13.716949041,"_type":"aimessage"}]
