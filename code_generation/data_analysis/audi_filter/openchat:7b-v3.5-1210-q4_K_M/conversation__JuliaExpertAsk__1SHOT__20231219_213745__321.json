Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure! Here's an example of how you could write a function to filter the `df_cars` DataFrame based on the manufacturer and model columns:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrames)\n    # Filter rows where manufacturer is \"audi\"\n    audi_rows = df[:manufacturer] .== \"audi\"\n    # Filter rows where model is either \"a4\" or \"a4Quattro\"\n    a4_rows = df[:model] .contains(\"a4\") .OR. df[:model] .contains(\"a4Quattro\")\n    # Create a new column indicating which rows are from Audi and contain the \"a4\" or \"a4Quattro\" model\n    audi_a4_type = audi_rows .&. a4_rows\n    # Return the resulting DataFrame\n    df_filtered = df[audi_a4_type]\n    return df_filtered\nend\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[141,230],"elapsed":8.402132333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
