Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Then, it further filters those rows to only include models that are either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Finally, it adds a new column called `audi_a4_type` and sets it to `True` for all rows in the filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[113,289],"elapsed":39.696761083,"_type":"aimessage"}]
