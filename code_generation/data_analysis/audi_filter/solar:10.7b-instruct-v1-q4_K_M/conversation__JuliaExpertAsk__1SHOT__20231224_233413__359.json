Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

It then adds a new column named `audi_a4_type`, filled with true values for each row in the filtered DataFrame. Finally, the function returns the resulting filtered DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[160,243],"elapsed":15.115837625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
