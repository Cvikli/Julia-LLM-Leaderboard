Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here's my implementation of the `audi_filter` function:\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df::DataFrame)\n    # Filter rows where manufacturer is \"audi\"\n    audi_rows = df.manufacturer .== \"audi\"\n\n    # Filter rows where model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    a4_rows = df.model .incls (\"a4\", \"a4 quarto\")\n\n    # Create a new column that indicates if the row is an Audi A4\n    audi_a4_type =audi_rows .&. a4_rows\n\n    # Return the resulting DataFrame\n    return df .* audi_a4_type\nend\n```\nLet me explain how the function works:\n\n1. `df::DataFrame`: This line of code takes the input DataFrame as an argument, which we'll call `df` for convenience.\n2. `audi_rows = df.manufacturer .== \"audi\"`: This line filters the rows where the manufacturer is not \"audi\". The `.==` operator checks if the value in the `manufacturer` column is equal to \"audi\".\n3. `a4_rows = df.model .incls (\"a4\", \"a4 quarto\")` : This line filters the rows where the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quarto\". The `.incls` operator checks if the value in the `model` column is included in the list of strings we're interested in.\n4. `audi_a4_type = audi_rows .&. a4_rows`: This line creates a new column called `udi_a4_type` that indicates if the row is an Audi A4. The `.&` operator performs a bitwise AND operation between the two filters, resulting in a boolean array of the same size as the input DataFrame.\n5. `return df .* audi_a4_type`: This line returns the resulting DataFrame, where each row has a new column `udi_a4_type` that indicates if it's an Audi A4. The `.*` operator performs element-wise multiplication between the input DataFrame and the new boolean array.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[311,513],"elapsed":21.042689834,"_type":"aimessage"}]
