Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Within the data frame `df_cars` filter the rows where `manufacturer` is \"audi\" and `model` is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n   - Add a new column `audi_a4_type` to the filtered data frame with the value `true` for all rows.\n\n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter the DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Create a new column `audi_a4_type` with the value `true` for all remaining rows.\n    filtered_df.audi_a4_type = true\n    \n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n   - I'll be creating the function `audi_filter` with the given dataframe `df_cars` and return the modified dataframe as per the task.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n   - Execute the function with the example provided and verify that the resulting data frame has the correct rows and the new column.\n\nNow, I will implement the function as described and test it with the provided data.","status":200,"tokens":[283,324],"elapsed":15.224570791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
