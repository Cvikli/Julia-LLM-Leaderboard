Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows.

Here is the function `audi_filter` written in Julia that implements the requirements you've described:\n\n```julia\nusing DataFrames\n\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars::DataFrame)\n    # Filter the DataFrame to only include rows with manufacturer \"audi\"\n    # and model being \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\"\n    filtered_df = filter(row -> row.manufacturer == \"audi\" && \n                         (row.model == \"a4\" || row.model == \"a4 quattro\"), df_cars)\n    \n    # Add a new column `audi_a4_type` with value `true`\n    filtered_df.audi_a4_type = true\n    \n    return filtered_df\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a DataFrame `df_cars`, filters it based on the conditions provided, and adds a `true` value in a new column `audi_a4_type` for all the rows in the filtered DataFrame. Make sure to have the `DataFrames` package available when using the function.","status":200,"tokens":[137,205],"elapsed":9.19301275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
