Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_audi = filter(df_cars, :manufacturer => ==(\"Audi\"))\n    df_a4 = filter(df_audi, :model => in([\"A4\", \"A4 Quattro\"]))\n    df_a4[:audi_a4_type] = true\n    return df_a4\nend\n```\nThis function first filters the `df_cars` DataFrame to only include rows where the `manufacturer` column is equal to `\"Audi\"`, using the `filter()` method. It then filters the resulting DataFrame to only include rows where the `model` column is equal to either `\"A4\"` or `\"A4 Quattro\"`, using the `filter()` method again. Finally, it creates a new column called `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows in the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,208],"elapsed":1.705360335,"_type":"aimessage"}]
