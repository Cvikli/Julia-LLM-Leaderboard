Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df = filter(df_cars, :manufacturer => ==(\"audi\"))\n    df = filter(df, :model => .==(\"a4\") | .==(\"a4 quattro\"))\n    df[:audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The `filter` function is used to filter down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer \"audi\".\n2. The second `filter` function is used to filter down the resulting dataset to only the rows where the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n3. The `:=` operator is used to create a new column called `audi_a4_type` and set it to true across all rows.\n4. Finally, the function returns the resulting DataFrame with the filtered data and the newly created column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,206],"elapsed":1.688611647,"_type":"aimessage"}]
