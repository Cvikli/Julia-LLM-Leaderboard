First, I defined the `manufacturer` and `model` columns of the `df_cars` DataFrame.\n2. Next, I defined the `audi_filter` function that takes a `df` argument and filters it based on two conditions: (a) The manufacturer is \"audi\", and (b) The model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quadruo\".\n3. Inside the `audi_filter` function, I used the `findall` function to find all rows that match the two conditions.\n4. Then, I created a new column `udi_a4_type` and set it to `true` across all rows that matched the conditions.\n5. Finally, I returned the resulting DataFrame using the `merge` function, which merges the filtered rows with the original rows based on the `manufacturer` and `model` columns.\n\nThe resulting DataFrame `df_cars` should have only the rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is either \"a4\" or \"a4 quadruo\". The new column `udi_a4_type` will be set to `true` across all such rows.","status":200,"tokens":[311,567],"elapsed":23.119212458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
