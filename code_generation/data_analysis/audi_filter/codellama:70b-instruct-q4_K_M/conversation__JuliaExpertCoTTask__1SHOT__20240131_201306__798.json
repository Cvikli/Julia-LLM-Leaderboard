Then we define an `audi_filter` function that takes a `DataFrame` as input and returns a filtered DataFrame with the required conditions. \nFirst, we filter the given DataFrame to only include rows where the manufacturer is \"audi\" and the model is \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\". Then, we create a new column named `audi_a4_type` and set all its values to true using broadcasting. Finally, we return the filtered DataFrame with the newly added column.","status":200,"tokens":[0,307],"elapsed":16.483803033,"_type":"aimessage"}]
