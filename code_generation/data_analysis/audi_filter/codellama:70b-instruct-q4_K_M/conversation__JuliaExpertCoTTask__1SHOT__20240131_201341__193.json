Write a function audi_filter that filters down the dataset to only the rows with manufacturer “audi” and model being “a4 or “a4 quattro”, then it should create a new column `audi_a4_type` that equals `true` across all rows. Then return the resulting DataFrame.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\ndf_cars = DataFrame(manufacturer=[\"audi\", \"audi\", \"bmw\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"ford\", \"audi\", \"audi\", \"toyota\", \"audi\"],\n    model=[\"a4\", \"a6\", \"3 series\", \"a4 quattro\", \"q7\", \"fusion\", \"tt\", \"a4\", \"corolla\", \"a4 quattro\"])\naudi_filter(df_cars)","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\n```julia\nfunction audi_filter(df_cars)\n    df_result = filter(:manufacturer => ==(\"audi\"), :model => in([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"]), df_cars)\n    df_result[!, :audi_a4_type] .= true\n    return df_result\nend\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   The `filter` function is used to filter the DataFrame based on conditions. Here, we filter by the manufacturer column and keep only rows with value \"audi\".\n*   We also add an extra condition using `:model => in([\"a4\", \"a4 quattro\"])` to include only rows where the model column has values \"a4\" or \"a4 quattro\".\n*   Finally, we create a new column `audi_a4_type` and assign it the value true across all rows.\n*   The `return df_result` statement returns the resulting DataFrame.","status":200,"tokens":[0,221],"elapsed":11.83907977,"_type":"aimessage"}]
