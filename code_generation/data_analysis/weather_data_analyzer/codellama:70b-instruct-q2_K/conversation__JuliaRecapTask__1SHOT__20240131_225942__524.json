[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia-repl\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    diffs = [temps[i] - temps[i-1] for i in 2:length(temps)]\n    if all(diff -> diff > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff -> diff < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the input list is not empty, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the Statistics package. It also finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions respectively.\n\nTo determine the trend of the data, it calculates the differences between adjacent temperatures. If all the differences are positive, the trend is `:increasing`. If all the differences are negative, the trend is :decreasing. Otherwise, if there are both positive and negative differences or no difference at all, the trend is `:stable`.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":15.518232734,"_type":"aimessage"}]
