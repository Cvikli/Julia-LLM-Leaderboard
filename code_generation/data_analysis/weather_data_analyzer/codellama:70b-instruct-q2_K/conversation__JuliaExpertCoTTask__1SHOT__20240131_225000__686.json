When Data is not provided, create some examples.\n","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's how you can solve the task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    nt = NamedTuple()\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mn, mx = extrema(temps)\n    if temps[1] < temps[2]\n        trd = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[2]\n        trd = :decreasing\n    else\n        trd = :stable\n    end\n    return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trd)\nend\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `weather_data_analyzer`, which takes as input a list of daily temperatures. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it computes the average temperature (using `mean`), the minimum and maximum temperatures (`extrema`), and the trend using an if-else statement that checks whether the first two elements of the input list are increasing or decreasing. Finally, it returns a named tuple with all four values.\n\nYou can try running this function with different temperature lists to see how it works:\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n# (average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :increasing)\n```\n\nPlease note that I've assumed that the temperature list is in ascending order and always has at least two elements. If this assumption doesn't hold for your application, you may need to modify the code accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,422],"elapsed":17.428378911,"_type":"aimessage"}]
