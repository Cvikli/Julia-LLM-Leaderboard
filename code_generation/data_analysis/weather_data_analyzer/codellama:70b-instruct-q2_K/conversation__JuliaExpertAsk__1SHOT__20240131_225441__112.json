It uses the Statistics package to calculate mean, maximum, minimum, and differences between consecutive temperatures. If the number of days is less than or equal to 1 (i.e., no trend can be calculated), it returns `nothing` for all values except average, which is set to 0. If there are at least two days, it calculates the trend by comparing the differences between consecutive temperatures. If all of these differences are negative, the temperature trend is decreasing; if they're all positive, it's increasing; otherwise, the trend is stable. It returns a named tuple with the calculated values for average, maximum, minimum, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,375],"elapsed":15.364729206,"_type":"aimessage"}]
