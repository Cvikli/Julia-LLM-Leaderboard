[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

It first checks if the input list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing in this case. If the list is not empty, it computes the average temperature using the `Statistics.mean` function from the Statistics package. Then, it finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using built-in functions `maximum` and `minimum`. It also tries to determine the trend by iterating over all temperatures except the first and last ones. If a temperature is greater than its previous and less than its next one, it sets the trend to :increasing. Similarly, if a temperature is less than its previous and greater than its next one, it sets the trend to :decreasing. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. Otherwise, it returns a named tuple with computed values for average, max, min, and trend.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ğŸ˜Š","status":200,"tokens":[0,675],"elapsed":28.123791327,"_type":"aimessage"}]
