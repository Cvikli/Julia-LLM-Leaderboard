Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"ðŸ”¥ **Attention!** This is a Julia programming challenge. ðŸ”¥\n\nThe syntax in this language can be quite cryptic and abstract, so let me break it down for you:\n\n```julia-repl\nusing Statistics # Import the Statistics package to perform statistical analyses on the data\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps) # Define a function that takes a list of temperatures as input\n    if isempty(temps)  # If the temperature list is empty, return a tuple with all values set to nothing\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    average = mean(temps)  # Calculate the average temperature using the mean function from Statistics package\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Find the highest recorded temperature in the list\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Find the lowest recorded temperature in the list\n    trend = ifelse(max_temp > temps[1], :increasing, ifelse(min_temp < temps[1], :decreasing, :stable))  # If the highest temperature is greater than the first one, it's an increasing trend; if the lowest temperature is less than the first one, it's a decreasing trend; otherwise it's stable.\n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)  # Return the resulting tuple with all the calculated values\nend\n```\n\nThe key points to remember here are:\n\n1. The `temps` list is a mandatory input for the function. If it's not provided or is empty, the function returns a named tuple (`(; key=value)`) with all fields set to `nothing`.\n2. To perform statistical analyses on the data, we import the `Statistics` package and use its functions: `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`. These functions will help us find the average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature, respectively.\n3. The trend is determined based on comparing the highest (`max_temp`) and lowest (`min_temp`) temperatures with the first one in the list (`temps[1]`). If the `max_temp` value is greater than the first value in the list, it's an increasing trend; if the `min_temp` value is less than the first value in the list, it's a decreasing trend; otherwise, the trend is stable.\n4. The final return statement constructs a named tuple with all the calculated values, and we use `ifelse` for conditional statements.","status":200,"tokens":[193,589],"elapsed":24.65839548,"_type":"aimessage"}]
