Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) # Check whether the list is empty or not\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)  # Calculate the average temperature using Statistics package\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Find the highest temperature in the list\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Find the lowest temperature in the list\n    \n    if temps[end] > temps[1]  # Check whether there is an increase or decrease of temperatures over time\n        trend = :increasing  \n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]  # If not, check whether it's decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else  # If neither, the temperatures are stable (not changing)\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average = average, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)  # Return a named tuple with all the results\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes in a list of temperature data and calculates various statistics on it. It uses the Statistics package to calculate the mean (average), and compares the first and last elements of the list to determine whether there is an increasing, decreasing, or stable trend. Finally, it returns a named tuple with all the results. If the input list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing.","status":200,"tokens":[0,352],"elapsed":14.571743646,"_type":"aimessage"}]
