Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\nWe can solve this task by following these steps:\n\n1. Define a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes a list of daily temperature data `temps` as an argument.\n2. Initialize an empty named tuple to store the results.\n3. Calculate the average, max, and min temperatures using the Statistics package.\n4. Determine the trend of the data by comparing the maximum and minimum temperatures with the current temperature in each day. If the current temperature is higher than both the maximum and minimum temperatures, the trend is increasing; if it is lower than both, the trend is decreasing; otherwise, the trend is stable.\n5. Return the named tuple containing the average, max, min temperatures, and the trend. If the list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nHere's the code for the function:\n\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    results = (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing) # Initialize an empty named tuple\n    if length(temps) > 0 # Check if the list is empty\n        average = mean(temps) # Calculate the average temperature\n        max = statistics(temps)[1] # Get the maximum temperature\n        min = statistics(temps)[2] # Get the minimum temperature\n        trend = if temps[end] > max && temps[end] > min # Check if the current temperature is increasing\n                     :increasing\n                elseif temps[end] < min && temps[end] < max # Check if the current temperature is decreasing\n                     :decreasing\n                else # Check if the current temperature is stable\n                     :stable\n        return results # Return the named tuple with the results\n    else # If the list is empty\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing) # Return a named tuple with all values set to nothing\nend\n\nNow we can use this function to analyze the given data:\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","status":200,"tokens":[293,492],"elapsed":39.398503,"_type":"aimessage"}]
