[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"You are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"If the list has only one element, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to this value.\nThe trend is calculated as follows: if the previous day's temperature is higher than the current day's temperature, it's increasing; otherwise, it's decreasing (note that we don't take into account the last day in our calculations). If a sequence of two or more days are stable, i.e., have same temperature as the first one in this sequence, then the trend is stable.\n\n### Examples ###\n\n```jldoctest; setup = :(using Statistics)\njulia> weather_data_analyzer([15, 14, 13, 12, 10])\n(average = 12.0, max = 15, min = 10, trend = :increasing)\n\njulia> weather_data_analyzer([15, 16, 14, 13, 12, 10])\n(average = 12.8, max = 16, min = 10, trend = :increasing)\n\njulia> weather_data_analyzer([15, 16, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9])\n(average = 12.8, max = 16, min = 9, trend = :stable)\n\njulia> weather_data_analyzer([-5, -7, -11])\n(average = -8.0, max = -5, min = -11, trend = :decreasing)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[134,383],"elapsed":21.695271042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
