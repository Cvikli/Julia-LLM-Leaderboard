Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To achieve the task, I will use the following steps:\n\n1. Import the `Statistics` package that I need for computing the average (mean).\n2. I will write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes the `temps` list as an input and initially checks if the list is empty.\n3. If not empty, I will calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using built-in Julia functions.\n4. To determine the `trend`, I will compare each subsequent temperature value with the previous one to see if the list is increasing, decreasing, or stable.\n5. I will then return the results as a named tuple.\n\nLet's implement this function.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = :stable\n    \n    # Determine the trend base on temperatures sequence\n    for i in 2:length(temps)\n        if temps[i] < temps[i-1]\n            if trend == :increasing\n                trend = :stable\n                break\n            end\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif temps[i] > temps[i-1]\n            if trend == :decreasing\n                trend = :stable\n                break\n            end\n            trend = :increasing\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nNow, apply the above function to the provided data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis should give us a named tuple with the average temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and the `trend`. Since the data doesn't show a clear increasing or decreasing trend, the expected trend would be `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[255,415],"elapsed":17.813359291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
