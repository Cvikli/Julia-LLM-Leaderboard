Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Firstly, let's think through the approach step by step:\n\n- I'll need to calculate the average of the daily temperature data. This can be done using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n- I'll find the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions from Julia's base functionality respectively.\n- To determine the trend, I'll compare the first and last elements in the list.\n  - If the last element is greater than the first, the trend is `:increasing`.\n  - If the last element is less than the first, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n  - If the last element is equal to the first, the trend is `:stable`.\n- If the list is empty, directly return the named tuple with all values as `nothing`.\n- Otherwise, create and return the named tuple with the calculated values.\n\nNow, let's implement the function `weather_data_analyzer` following the step-by-step approach:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # Load the Statistics package for mean function\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)  # Calculate average temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Find the maximum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Find the minimum temperature\n\n    if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's solve the given task:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nAfter running this, we should check if the solution `(average, max, min, trend)` corresponds to the expected values: `(average=23.4, max=27, min=20, trend=:decreasing)`.","status":200,"tokens":[255,446],"elapsed":25.250779291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
