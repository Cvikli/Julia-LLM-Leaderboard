Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia, you'll first need to import the `Statistics` package to use its statistical functions. Then, you can define the function to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures from the `temps` list. To determine the trend, you'll need to compare the temperatures in sequence.\n\nHere's how you can write the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    trend = :stable  # Default trend\n    if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function, `diff(temps)` computes the difference between consecutive temperatures. If all differences are positive, the trend is increasing. If all differences are negative, the trend is decreasing. If there are both positive and negative differences, the trend is considered stable.\n\nYou can now use this function to analyze your temperature data:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 25, 28, 30, 32]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThis will output the statistical analysis of the temperature data in the form of a named tuple. If `temps` is an empty list, the function will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[143,374],"elapsed":34.299749875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
