The `diff` function is used to calculate the difference between consecutive temperature values, allowing us to determine the trend. Remember to replace `temps_example` with actual temperature data when using the function. If the list is empty, the function correctly returns a named tuple with `nothing` for all values.","status":200,"tokens":[140,421],"elapsed":50.609256916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
