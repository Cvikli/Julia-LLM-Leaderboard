Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To create the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia, you can follow the structure below. The function computes the average, max, and min from the given temperature list and determines the trend of temperature change:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty and return values as nothing\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate average, max, and min\n    avg_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    trend = if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n        :increasing\n    elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return the results as a named tuple\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\n# temps = [73, 74, 75, 74, 73, 76]\n# results = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n# println(results)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `Statistics` package provides functions like `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`.\n- The `diff` function computes the difference between consecutive elements in the list; a positive difference indicates an increase, while a negative indicates a decrease.\n- The `trend` is determined using the `all` function along with the `.>` and `.<` operators to check if all differences are either positive or negative, respectively; otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n- A named tuple is constructed with the calculated values and returned. If the list is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[143,393],"elapsed":25.92675275,"_type":"aimessage"}]
