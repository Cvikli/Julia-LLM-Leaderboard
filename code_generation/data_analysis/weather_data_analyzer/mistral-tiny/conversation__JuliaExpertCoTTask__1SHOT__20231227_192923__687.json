Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To write the `weather_data_analyzer` function, I'll follow the problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Approach:\n   - Import the Statistics package.\n   - Define a function that calculates statistical analyses and determines the trend.\n\n2. Write code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Number})\n    isnothing(temps) && return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n\n    stats = Statistics.mean(temps), minimum(temps), maximum(temps)\n\n    trend = ifelse(Statsbase.trend(temps) > 0, :increasing,\n                   ifelse(Statsbase.trend(temps) < 0, :decreasing, :stable))\n\n    (; average=stats[1], max=stats[2], min=stats[3], trend)\nend\n```\n\n3.
