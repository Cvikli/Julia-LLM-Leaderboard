Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To write the `weather_data_analyzer` function, I will follow the problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n   a. Import the required package: Statistics\n   b. Check if the input list is empty\n   c. If not, calculate the average, max, min temperatures using functions from the Statistics package\n   d. Determine the trend of the temperature data\n   e. Return a named tuple with the results\n\n2.

Check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe function correctly calculates the average, max, min temperatures and determines the trend based on the given input. The trend is determined by checking the covariance between the temperature data and time index. A positive covariance indicates an increasing trend, a negative covariance indicates a decreasing trend, and a covariance of zero indicates a stable trend.","status":200,"tokens":[295,463],"elapsed":4.157402042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
