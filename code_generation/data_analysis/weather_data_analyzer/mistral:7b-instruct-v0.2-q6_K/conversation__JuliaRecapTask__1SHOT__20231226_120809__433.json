X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the problem statement and the special instructions provided, here's how I would approach the solution in Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this task:\n   - Importing the Statistics module for statistical analysis\n   - Defining a function with `function` keyword\n   - Returning a named tuple using `(;)` syntax\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractArray{<:Number})\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Perform statistical analysis and store results in variables\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend based on the difference between max and min temperatures\n    diff = max_temp - min_temp\n    if diff > 0\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif diff < 0\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Return the results in a named tuple\n    (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   The function `weather_data_analyzer` takes an array of numbers as its argument and returns a named tuple with average, max, min temperatures and their corresponding trends based on the given conditions.
