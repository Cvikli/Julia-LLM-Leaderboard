Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution to this problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysisResult\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalysisResult(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = get_temperature_trend(temps, minTemp, maxTemp)\n  \n    WeatherDataAnalysisResult(average, maxTemp, minTemp, trend)\nend\n\nfunction get_temperature_trend(temps, minTemp, maxTemp)\n    if minTemp in temps && maxTemp in temps\n        return :stable\n    elseif minTemp in temps && !(maxTemp in temps) \n        return :decreasing\n    elseif !(minTemp in temps) && maxTemp in temps\n        return :increasing\n    end\nend\n```\nThis script first checks if the `temps` array is empty.

This function uses the `get_temperature_trend()` helper function to check if the min and max values are present in the temps array. \nIf both are present, it returns `:stable`. If only the minimum value is present, it returns `:decreasing`, and vice versa. The trend is then stored in a named tuple along with the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, which is returned by `weather_data_analyzer()`.","status":200,"tokens":[290,453],"elapsed":24.947333167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
