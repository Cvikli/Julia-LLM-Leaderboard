[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics  # To use functions like mean, max, min etc.\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n        minTemp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if avg < temps[1]\n            trend = :decreasing\n        elseif avg > temps[1]\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` works as follows: \n- It first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`. This is because there's no data to analyze in this case.\n- Otherwise, it computes the average (`avg`), maximum and minimum temperatures from the `temps` list. \n- It then checks if the average temperature is less than or greater than the first value of the `temps` list, which might give us an idea about whether the weather is increasing or decreasing over time. The trend is then set to either `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.\n- Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the average (`avg`), maximum, minimum temperatures and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[455,359],"elapsed":21.200075542,"_type":"aimessage"}]
