Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the function you asked for. This function uses the `Statistics` package to find the average, maximum, minimum values and then determines a trend based on these values:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherData <:NamedTuple\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherData(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        trend = ifelse(max_temp > average, :increasing,\n                       (min_temp < average) ? :decreasing : :stable)\n        \n        return WeatherData(average, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn the function above:\n- `mean(temps)` returns the average temperature.\n- `maximum(temps)` returns the maximum temperature in the list.\n- `minimum(temps)` returns the minimum temperature in the list.\n- The `ifelse` function is used to determine whether the trend is increasing, decreasing or stable based on the average and max/min temperatures. If the maximum temperature is greater than the average temperature then the trend is :increasing, if it's less than the average it means the trend is :decreasing otherwise the trend is :stable.\n- If the list of daily temperatures `temps` is empty, a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` is returned.","status":200,"tokens":[194,402],"elapsed":21.559872208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
