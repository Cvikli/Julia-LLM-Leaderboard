Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia function that satisfies the conditions given in your problem.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    elseif length(unique(temps)) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif maximum(temps) > minimum(temps)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=mean(temps), max=maximum(temps), min=minimum(temps), trend=trend)\nend\n```\nIn the above function, `isempty` checks if the list is empty. If it's not, it uses the `Statistics` package to compute the mean (average), maximum and minimum values of the given list. It then determines the trend based on these values and returns a named tuple with these values.\n\nNote: This function assumes that the input list has no repeated elements (i.e., it's a unique list). If there are duplicate temperatures in your data, you may need to handle this case differently.","status":200,"tokens":[194,273],"elapsed":14.910873917,"_type":"aimessage"}]
