Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Firstly, you should install `Statistics` package. You can do it by typing `using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"Statistics\")` in your Julia console.\n\nHere is a possible solution for the problem:\n\n```julia\nimport Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = Statistics.mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > max_temp\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif average < min_temp\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else \n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. \n\nIf the list has elements, it calculates the average temperature by using `Statistics.mean` from `Statistics` package, the maximum and minimum temperatures by using built-in Julia functions `maximum` and `minimum`. It determines the trend of temperature changes based on whether the average is greater than or less than either max_temp or min_temp.\n\nFinally, it returns a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and the `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[194,363],"elapsed":19.520968,"_type":"aimessage"}]
