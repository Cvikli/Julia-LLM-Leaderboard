Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution using Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysisResult\n    average::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    max::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    min::Union{Float64, Nothing}\n    trend::Union{Symbol, Nothing}\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps) \n        return WeatherDataAnalysisResult(nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse((max_temp - min_temp) >= 0.0, :increasing, :decreasing)\n    \n    return WeatherDataAnalysisResult(avg, max_temp, min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\nThis function takes as input a list of daily temperature data `temps` and returns the named tuple `WeatherDataAnalysisResult`.
