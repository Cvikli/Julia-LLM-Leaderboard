[{"content":"Act as a helpful AI assistant","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"In Julia, You are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, you need to install the `Statistics` package. You can do this with the following command:\n```julia\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\nusing Statistics\n```\nNow, you can define your function like so:\n\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        if avg > max_temp || avg < min_temp\n            trend = :increasing # or :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\nIn this function, we first check if the list is empty. If it's empty, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If it's not empty, we calculate the mean and maximum/minimum temperatures. Then we compare these values. If the average temperature is greater than or less than either of the other two temperatures, we classify the trend as `:increasing` or `:decreasing`, otherwise, it's `:stable`. Finally, we return a named tuple with all these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[155,328],"elapsed":17.354574459,"_type":"aimessage"}]
