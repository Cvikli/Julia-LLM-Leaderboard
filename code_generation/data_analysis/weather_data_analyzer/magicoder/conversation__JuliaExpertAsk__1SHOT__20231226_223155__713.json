Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"You can solve this problem by writing a function that uses the `Statistics` package to calculate basic statistical properties of the given data. In this case, we are interested in finding the mean (average), maximum and minimum values.\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)  # check if list is empty\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)  # compute average\n        maxi = maximum(temps)  # find the max temperature\n        mini = minimum(temps)  # find the min temperature\n\n        if avg > maxi  # check trend (increasing)\n            return (average=avg, max=maxi, min=mini, trend=:increasing)\n        elseif avg < mini  # decreasing\n            return (average=avg, max=maxi, min=mini, trend=:decreasing)\n        else  # stable (when average equals to the temperature with maximum value)\n            return (average=avg, max=maxi, min=mini, trend=:stable)\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the given list of daily temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the average (mean), maximum and minimum temperatures, and then determines which trend is predominant - increasing, decreasing or stable based on these calculated values. It then constructs and returns a named tuple in the form `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)`.","status":200,"tokens":[194,399],"elapsed":12.927677959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
