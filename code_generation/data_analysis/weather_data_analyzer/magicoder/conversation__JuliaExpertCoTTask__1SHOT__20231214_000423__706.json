Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great, let's get started!

The function takes a list of temperature values as input.\n2. We check if the list is empty using the `length` function. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n3. Otherwise, we calculate the average temperature using the `mean` function.\n4. Next, we calculate the maximum temperature using the `max` function.\n5. Then, we calculate the minimum temperature using the `min` function.\n6. Finally, we determine the trend of the temperatures based on the difference between the maximum and minimum values. If the maximum value is greater than the minimum value, the trend is `:increasing`. Otherwise, if the minimum value is greater than the maximum value, the trend is `:decreasing`. If the differences is small and consistent, the trend is `:stable`.\n7. We return a named tuple with the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.","status":200,"tokens":[280,499],"elapsed":19.892962541,"_type":"aimessage"}]
