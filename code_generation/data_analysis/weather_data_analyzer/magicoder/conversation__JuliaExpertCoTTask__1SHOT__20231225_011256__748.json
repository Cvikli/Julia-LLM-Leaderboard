Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible Julia solution:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\n# Define the function\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate stats\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine the trend\n    if max_temp == temps[1] && all(x -> x > max_temp, temps)\n        trend = :increasing \n    elseif min_temp == temps[1] && all(x -> x < min_temp, temps)\n        trend = :decreasing \n    else\n        trend = :stable \n    end\n\n    # Return as named tuple\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis solution first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with `nothing` values for all keys. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum` and `minimum` functions from Statistics package. Then it determines the trend based on whether the max temperature equals the first item in the list (`temps[1]`) and every other number is greater than or equal to this value (with `all(x -> x > max_temp, temps)`), or if the min temperature does the same thing but checks for less than instead of greater than. It finally constructs and returns a named tuple with the calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[290,387],"elapsed":13.201976125,"_type":"aimessage"}]
