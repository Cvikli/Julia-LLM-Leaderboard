Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a possible implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics  # Package for statistical functions.\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0   # If list is empty, return named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n        return (; average = nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average = mean(temps)   # Calculate average temperature.\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)   # Find the max and min temperatures.\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if average > max_temp || average < min_temp  # Check trend based on average temp and max/min temps.\n        return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"increasing\")\n    elseif average == max_temp && average == min_temp   # If average equals to both max and min, it's stable.\n        return (; average = average, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = :stable)\n    else\n        return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=\"decreasing\")\n    end\nend\n``` \n\nThis function first checks if the length of `temps` is zero. If it is, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to nothing. If not, it calculates the mean (`average`), maximum (`max_temp`) and minimum (`min_temp`) temperatures from the given list `temps`. \n\nNext, it checks if the average temperature is either higher than max or lower than min, then sets the trend accordingly (`increasing` if the average is higher, else `decreasing`). If the average equals to both max and min, then sets the trend as `:stable`. The function finally returns a named tuple containing all these values.","status":200,"tokens":[155,443],"elapsed":13.969997583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
