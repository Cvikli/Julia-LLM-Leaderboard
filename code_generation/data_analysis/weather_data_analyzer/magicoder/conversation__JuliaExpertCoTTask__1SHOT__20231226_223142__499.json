Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a Julia solution for the problem. It uses the Statistics standard library to calculate statistical properties and the DataStructures package to return named tuples.\n\nFirst, install these packages if you haven't done so:\n```julia\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Statistics\")\nPkg.add(\"DataStructures\")\n```\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics, DataStructures\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    minTemp = minimum(temps)\n    maxTemp = maximum(temps)\n    \n    if avg > minTemp && avg > maxTemp\n        return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=:increasing)\n    elseif avg < minTemp && avg < maxTemp\n        return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=:decreasing)\n    else \n        return (average=avg, max=maxTemp, min=minTemp, trend=:stable)\n    end\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, it calculates the mean (`avg`), minimum and maximum temperatures of the data (using `mean` and `minimum`, respectively) and determines the trend based on whether the average temperature exceeds or falls below these extremes.","status":200,"tokens":[290,377],"elapsed":18.614205042,"_type":"aimessage"}]
