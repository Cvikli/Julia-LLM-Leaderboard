Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the solution using Julia programming language.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nstruct WeatherDataAnalysis <: NamedTuple\n    average::Float64\n    min::Union{Nothing, Float64}\n    max::Union{Nothing, Float64}\n    trend::Symbol\nend\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return WeatherDataAnalysis(nothing, nothing, nothing, :stable)\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        \n        trend = ifelse(min_temp < average, :decreasing, \n                      ifelse(max_temp > average, :increasing, :stable))\n        \n        return WeatherDataAnalysis(average, min_temp, max_temp, trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function works as follows: if the list `temps` is empty, it creates a named tuple with all values set to nothing (represented by `nothing` keyword in Julia). If not, it calculates the average of the temperatures using `mean` function and minimum and maximum temperatures using `minimum` and `maximum`. It then checks if the minimum temperature is less than or equal to the average. If yes, returns `:decreasing`, otherwise checks if the maximum temperature is greater than or equal to the average. If yes, it returns `:increasing`, else it returns `:stable`. Finally, it constructs and returns a named tuple with these calculated values.","status":200,"tokens":[194,358],"elapsed":11.666196791,"_type":"aimessage"}]
