[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a sample solution written in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Import necessary packages \n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0 # If list is empty, return named tuple with all values set to nothing\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    data = map(Float64, temps) # Convert the temp list into an array of Float64 if not already\n    \n    avg_temp = mean(data) # Find the average temperature \n    max_temp = maximum(data) # Find the maximum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(data) # Find the minimum temperature\n    \n    trend_symbols = [:increasing, :decreasing, :stable]\n    trends = [avg_temp < 0 ? \"Increasing\" : (avg_temp == 0 ? \"Stable\" : \"Decreasing\")] # Check the trend based on average temperature\n    \n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trends[1]) # Return named tuple with the results\nend\n``` \n\nYou can now call this function with your list of daily temperatures and it will provide you with the required statistical analysis. Here's an example usage:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [23, 25, 24, 26, 28] # Sample temperature data\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer(temps))\n```\n\nThis will output a named tuple with the average, maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as the trend. If you provide an empty list to the function, it will return `nothing` for all values. \n\nPlease note that this solution assumes your data is in Celsius scale (negative numbers for cooler days) which fits the problem description. You may need to adjust the code based on the specific requirements of your task.","status":200,"tokens":[458,453],"elapsed":16.383179667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
