Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Answer\n\nSure! Here's a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs the required statistical analyses on the given list of temperatures:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    average_temp = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = nothing\n    n = length(temps)\n    if n > 1\n        if temps[end] > temps[1]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package, respectively.\n\nTo determine the trend, the function checks if the last temperature in the list is greater than the first. If so, it sets the trend to `:increasing`. If the last temperature is smaller than the first, the trend is set to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, if the last and first temperature are equal, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n\nThe results are returned as a named tuple where `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` are the named fields.","status":200,"tokens":[178,353],"elapsed":6.172530333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
