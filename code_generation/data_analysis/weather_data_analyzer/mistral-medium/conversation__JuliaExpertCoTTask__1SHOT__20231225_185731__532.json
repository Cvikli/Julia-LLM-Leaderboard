Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a solution following the given steps:\n\n1. Think through your approach step by step:\n\n   a. Import the `Statistics` package.\n   b. Check if the input list `temps` is empty.\n   c. If it's empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n   d. If it's not empty, calculate the average, max, and min temperatures using `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n   e. Calculate the trend by comparing the first and last elements of the list.\n   f. Return a named tuple containing the calculated values.\n\n2.
