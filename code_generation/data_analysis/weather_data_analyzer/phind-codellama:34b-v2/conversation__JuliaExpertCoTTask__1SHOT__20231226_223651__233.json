Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this problem, I will start by importing the `Statistics` package. Then, I will create a function named `weather_data_analyzer`. This function will first check if the input list is empty. If it is, it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, I will use functions from the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. Then, I will determine the trend of the temperature data:\n\n- If the first and last temperatures are the same, the trend is `:stable`.\n- If the first temperature is less than the last, the trend is `:increasing`.\n- If the first temperature is greater than the last, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n\nFinally, I will return a named tuple containing these results. Here's the complete code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n    minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if temps[1] == temps[end]\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[1] < temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis will return a named tuple containing the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and trend of the given data.","status":200,"tokens":[301,448],"elapsed":84.056633375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
