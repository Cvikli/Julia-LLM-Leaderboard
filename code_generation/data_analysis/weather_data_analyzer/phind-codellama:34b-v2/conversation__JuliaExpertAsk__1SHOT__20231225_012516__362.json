Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a sample solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{<:Real,1})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        stats = (; \n            average=mean(temps), \n            max=maximum(temps), \n            min=minimum(temps), \n            trend=(temps[end] > temps[1]) ? :increasing : (temps[end] < temps[1]) ? :decreasing : :stable\n        )\n    end\n    return stats\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input `temps` is an array of real numbers. If it's empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the mean (`average`), maximum (`max`), minimum (`min`) temperatures and determines trend based on whether the last temperature is greater than or less than the first one.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input array of temperatures contains at least two elements to be able to compare the trend. If you call the function with an array containing only one element, it will return `:stable` as a weather trend which might not be accurate but it's a reasonable assumption based on one day of data.","status":200,"tokens":[205,310],"elapsed":43.120717875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
