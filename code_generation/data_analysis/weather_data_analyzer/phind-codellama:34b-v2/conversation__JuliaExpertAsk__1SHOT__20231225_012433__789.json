Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a function `weather_data_analyzer` that fulfills the requirements. The `trend` is determined by comparing the average of the first half of the data with the average of the second half. If it's greater, then `:increasing`, if less - `:decreasing`, otherwise - `:stable`.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        mid = length(temps) รท 2\n        first_half_avg = mean(@view temps[1:mid])\n        second_half_avg = mean(@view temps[mid+1:end])\n        \n        if first_half_avg < second_half_avg\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif first_half_avg > second_half_avg\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n        \n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Statistics.mean` function for calculation of the mean temperature and the `maximum` and `minimum` functions to get the highest and lowest temperatures in the list. The midpoint of the data is determined by integer division (`length(temps) รท 2`), and two halves are created using the `@view` macro which allows creating a view onto a subset of an array without copying it.\n\nIf the list `temps` is empty, all values in the returned named tuple are set to `nothing`. If it's not empty, then the average, maximum, minimum temperatures and trend are calculated and returned.","status":200,"tokens":[205,448],"elapsed":60.80305725,"_type":"aimessage"}]
