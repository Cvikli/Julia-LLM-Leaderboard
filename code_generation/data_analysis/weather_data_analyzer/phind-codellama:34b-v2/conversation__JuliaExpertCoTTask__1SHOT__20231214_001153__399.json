Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great!

Here is my implementation of `weather_data_analyzer`:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=\"stable\")\n    end\n\n    # Calculate the average temperature\n    avg = mean(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the maximum temperature\n    max = max(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the minimum temperature\n    min = min(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend\n    if all(diff(temps).ge(0))\n        trend = \":increasing\"\n    elseif any(diff(temps).le(0))\n        trend = \":decreasing\"\n    else\n        trend = \":stable\"\n    end\n\n    # Return the results in a named tuple\n    (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test with sample input data\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\nWith this code, we can now call `weather_data_analyzer` with a list of temperature values and it will return the statistical analyses results in a named tuple.
