Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a simple solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maximum_temp = maximum(temps)\n    minimum_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if length(temps) > 1\n        trend = :stable # assume stable unless we find otherwise\n        for i in 2:length(temps)\n            if temps[i] > temps[i-1]\n                if trend != :increasing\n                    return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=:increasing)\n                end\n            elseif temps[i] < temps[i-1]\n                if trend != :decreasing\n                    return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=:decreasing)\n                end\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=maximum_temp, min=minimum_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThe `weather_data_analyzer` function first checks if the input temperature list `temps` is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nThen, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package (`mean`, `maximum`, `minimum`).\n\nNext, it checks for temperature trends. If there is more than one data point, it initializes `trend` as `:stable` unless it can prove otherwise. It then iterates through the temperature list, comparing each temperature to its predecessor. If a warmer (higher) temperature is found after a cooler one (`temps[i] > temps[i-1]`), then the trend is `:increasing`. Likewise for `:decreasing`.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple with `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` fields. If there was only one data point, it defaults to `:stable` as temperatures cannot increase or decrease without at least two points of comparison.","status":200,"tokens":[205,536],"elapsed":72.319534292,"_type":"aimessage"}]
