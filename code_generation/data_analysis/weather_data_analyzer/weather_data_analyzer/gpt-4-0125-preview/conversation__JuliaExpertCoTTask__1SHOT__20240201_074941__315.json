Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, we need to analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the statistical measures**: We will calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures from the given `temps` list. This will be done using the `mean()`, `maximum()`, and `minimum()` functions from the `Statistics` package. We'll begin by importing this package.\n\n2. **Determine the trend of temperature changes**: The trend is identified by comparing each day's temperature with the previous day's:\n   - If the temperature always increases or remains the same, the trend is `:increasing`.\n   - If the temperature always decreases or remains the same, the trend is `:decreasing`.\n   - Otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n\n3. **Edge Case Handling**: If the given list of temperatures is empty, the function will return all values as `nothing`.\n\nNow, let's implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function following the mentioned steps:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Edge case: Empty list\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Statistical measures\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    mx = maximum(temps)\n    mn = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend\n    direction = temps[1] - temps[2:end] # Compute the difference between consecutive days\n    if all(x -> x >= 0, direction)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    elseif all(x -> x <= 0, direction)\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    # Return the result\n    return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function with the given data\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\nThis code calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, identifies the trend of temperature changes, and takes care of the edge case when the temperature list is empty.","status":200,"tokens":[255,440],"elapsed":23.829636708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
