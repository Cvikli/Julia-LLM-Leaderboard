Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, follow the steps outlined:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step**\n    - First, check if the list is empty. If yes, return a named tuple with `nothing` values.\n    - Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum values of the temperature list.\n    - Determine the trend based on the temperatures: if temperatures are strictly increasing, the trend is `:increasing`; if they are strictly decreasing, the trend is `:decreasing`; otherwise, the trend is `:stable`.\n    - Return the results in a named tuple with keys for each of these statistics.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need**\n    - Define the `weather_data_analyzer` function.\n    - Use the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package for statistical calculations.\n    - Implement the logic to decide the temperature trend.\n\n3. **Solve the task**\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = :stable\n    if all(temps[i] < temps[i + 1] for i in 1:length(temps) - 1)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[i] > temps[i + 1] for i in 1:length(temps) - 1)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct**\n    - Test the function with the provided data.\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\nThe function should return a named tuple with the average temperature, max and min temperatures, and the trend which in this case should be `:stable` due to fluctuations in the temperatures list. The exact values of `average`, `max`, and `min` depend on the specific calculations but for `[25, 27, 23, 20, 22]`, average would be `23.4`, max `27`, min `20`, and the trend `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[255,508],"elapsed":30.643712208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
