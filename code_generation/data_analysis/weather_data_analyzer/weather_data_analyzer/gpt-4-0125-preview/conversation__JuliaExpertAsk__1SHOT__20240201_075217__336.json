Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To analyze the weather data as described, you'll first need to import the `Statistics` package to access mean calculation capabilities. Then, follow these steps to compute the average, max, and min temperatures, as well as determine the trend. Note that the trend is defined as `:increasing` if each temperature is higher than the previous one, `:decreasing` if each temperature is lower than the previous one, and `:stable` otherwise (this means it neither strictly increases nor decreases for all elements).\n\nBelow is the implementation:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    increasing = all(temps[i] < temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n    decreasing = all(temps[i] > temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n    \n    trend = if increasing\n                :increasing\n            elseif decreasing\n                :decreasing\n            else\n                :stable\n            end\n    \n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function should work as expected for a variety of temperature datasets you pass to it, providing summary statistics and identifying the trend based on the daily temperature data in `temps`.","status":200,"tokens":[178,314],"elapsed":30.293489875,"_type":"aimessage"}]
