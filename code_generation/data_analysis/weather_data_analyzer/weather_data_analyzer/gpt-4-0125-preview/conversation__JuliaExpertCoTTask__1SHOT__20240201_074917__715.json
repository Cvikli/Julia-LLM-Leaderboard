Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, the approach involves:\n\n1. Think through your approach step by step:\n   - Check if the `temps` list is empty. If so, return a named tuple with all values as `nothing`.\n   - Calculate the average, max, and min temperatures using the `Statistics` package.\n   - Determine the trend. To do this:\n     - If all elements are the same, the trend is `:stable`.\n     - If each subsequent element is greater than or equal (for increasing) or less than or equal (for decreasing) to the previous one, then it's `:increasing` or `:decreasing` respectively.\n     - Otherwise, the trend cannot be determined from the given task, so we default to `:stable` for any other case as there's no directive for a mixed trend.\n   - Return the results in a named tuple.\n   \n2. Write any functions and other code you need:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = :stable  # by default\n    if all(temps[i] <= temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[i] >= temps[i+1] for i in 1:length(temps)-1)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    (;average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n3. Solve the task:\n\nNow, to apply the function to the provided data `[25, 27, 23, 20, 22]`.\n\n4. Check that your solution is correct:\n\nAfter implementing the function, I'll check the output for correctness. There's no increasing or decreasing consistent trend in the provided list, so the trend should default to `:stable`.\n\nLet's implement and execute the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)  # Expected Output: (average=23.4, max=27, min=20, trend=:stable)\n```\n\nThis is a concise plan and implementation approach following the specified problem-solving steps and the provision to create an example for execution.","status":200,"tokens":[255,523],"elapsed":42.016895916,"_type":"aimessage"}]
