If `temps` contains elements, it calculates the `average`, `max`, and `min` values. It determines the `trend` by checking the differences between subsequent temperature values: if all differences are positive, the trend is `:increasing`, if all are negative, it's `:decreasing`, and if there's a mix, the trend is classified as `:stable`. For a list with a single element, the trend is set to `:stable`.","status":200,"tokens":[178,280],"elapsed":21.745444666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
