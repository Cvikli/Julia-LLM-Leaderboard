If it is, it returns a named tuple where all values are set to `nothing`.\n- It calculates the average (mean) temperature.\n- It finds the maximum and minimum temperatures from the list.\n- It determines the trend by comparing each pair of consecutive elements. If every element is less than or equal to the next one, it sets the trend to `:increasing`. If every element is greater than or equal to the next one, it sets the trend to `:decreasing`. Otherwise, it concludes the trend is `:stable`.\n- Finally, it returns a named tuple comprised of the calculated `average`, the identified `max` and `min` temperatures, and the `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[143,388],"elapsed":32.088411792,"_type":"aimessage"}]
