Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Given the task, we will approach the problem by first importing the necessary Julia packages, then defining the function `weather_data_analyzer` as per the specifications.

If the list is not empty, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package and basic Julia functions. The calculation of the `trend` checks if the differences between successive measurements are all positive (indicating an increasing trend), all negative (indicating a decreasing trend), or neither (indicating the data is stable).","status":200,"tokens":[255,399],"elapsed":26.657238708,"_type":"aimessage"}]
