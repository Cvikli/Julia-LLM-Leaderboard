Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To perform statistical analyses on the temperature data and determine the trend, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Think through your approach step by step:**\n\n- Use the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package to calculate the average temperature.\n- Use the `maximum` and `minimum` functions to find the max and min temperatures, respectively.\n- Determine the trend by comparing each day's temperature to the previous day's. If all differences are positive, it's increasing; if all are negative, it's decreasing; otherwise, it's stable.\n- Use a loop or recursion to compare each day's temperature to determine the trend.\n- Return the results in a named tuple.\n\n2. **Write any functions and other code you need:**\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    function calculate_trend(temps)\n        increasing, decreasing = false, false\n        for i in 2:length(temps)\n            if temps[i] > temps[i-1]\n                increasing = true\n            elseif temps[i] < temps[i-1]\n                decreasing = true\n            end\n            if increasing && decreasing\n                return :stable\n            end\n        end\n        if increasing\n            return :increasing\n        elseif decreasing\n            return :decreasing\n        else\n            return :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    trend = calculate_trend(temps)\n    return (; average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n3. **Solve the task:**\n\nYou should now have a function `weather_data_analyzer` that analyzes the given temperature data and returns statistical measures and the identified trend.\n\n4. **Check that your solution is correct:**\n\nUsing the provided data `[25, 27, 23, 20, 22]`, the expected output should contain the average temperature, max and min temperatures, and the trend. The trend in this case should be `:stable` because the temperatures fluctuate up and down.\n\nNow you can use the `weather_data_analyzer` function to analyze the given temperature data.","status":200,"tokens":[255,484],"elapsed":46.846261458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
