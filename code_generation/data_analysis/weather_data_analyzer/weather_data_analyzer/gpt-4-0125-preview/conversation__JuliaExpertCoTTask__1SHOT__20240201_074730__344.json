Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve this task, I will follow the steps:\n1. Think through the approach.\n2. Write required code using the Julia language.\n3. Solve the task by implementing the function `weather_data_analyzer`.\n4. Check that the solution is correct with the provided data.\n\n### Step 1: Approach\n1. To find the average, I will use the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n2. For the maximum and minimum temperatures, the functions `maximum` and `minimum` would be appropriate.\n3. To determine the trend, I will compare each day's temperature with the previous day. If temperatures always increase, the trend is `:increasing`. If they always decrease, it is `:decreasing`. Otherwise, it is `:stable`.\n4. In case of an empty list, return `nothing` for all values in the named tuple.\n\n### Step 2 & 3: Writing the function\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check for an empty list\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate statistics\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    # Determine trend\n    trend = :stable  # Default value\n    if all(temps[i] > temps[i - 1] for i in 2:length(temps))\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(temps[i] < temps[i - 1] for i in 2:length(temps))\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n    \n    return (;average=average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check the solution\nNow, let's test the function with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result) # Expected: (average = 23.4, max = 27, min = 20, trend = :stable)\n```\n\nThis code follows the defined steps and solves the task using Julia's concise syntax and the built-in `Statistics` package.","status":200,"tokens":[255,474],"elapsed":30.689637458,"_type":"aimessage"}]
