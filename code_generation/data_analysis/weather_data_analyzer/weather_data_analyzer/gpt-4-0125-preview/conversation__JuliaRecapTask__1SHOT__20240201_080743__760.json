Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

Finally, we'll ensure the correctness of the solution by checking against the requirements.\n\n### Julia Snippets That Will Be Useful\n1. Importing the `Statistics` package for performing statistical analyses (though basic operations like `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` are available by default).\n2. Named tuple creation: `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)`.\n3. Assessing trends in the temperature data could involve examining the difference between consecutive elements.\n\n### Solve the Task\n\nWe'll write a function that takes in a list of temperatures, calculates the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, determines the `trend` of the data, and returns the results in a named tuple.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (;\n            average=nothing,\n            max=nothing,\n            min=nothing,\n            trend=nothing\n        )\n    else\n        average = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        trend = :stable # Assuming stable to begin with\n\n        # Determine the trend\n        if all(diff(temps) .> 0)\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(diff(temps) .< 0)\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n\n        return (;\n            average=average,\n            max=max_temp,\n            min=min_temp,\n            trend=trend\n        )\n    end\nend\n```\n\n### Double-check the Solution is Correct\n- The function handles empty lists by returning `nothing` values as expected.\n- The statistical measures (`average`, `max`, `min`) are calculated using functions available in Julia (`mean`, `maximum`, `minimum`).\n- The trend determination logic evaluates to `:increasing` if all differences between consecutive temperatures are positive, `:decreasing` if all are negative, and defaults to `:stable`, accurately according to the task requirements.\n\nThis solution should meet the task's requirements efficiently.","status":200,"tokens":[401,451],"elapsed":22.664264583,"_type":"aimessage"}]
