If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To analyze the weather data according to the requirements, you will need to make use of the `Statistics` package for calculating average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. The trend can be determined by comparing consecutive temperatures. Below is the Julia function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs the described analysis:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    trend = :stable\n    for i in 2:length(temps)\n        if temps[i] > temps[i-1]\n            if trend == :decreasing\n                trend = :stable\n                break\n            end\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif temps[i] < temps[i-1]\n            if trend == :increasing\n                trend = :stable\n                break\n            end\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function starts by checking if the list of temperatures is empty and returns a tuple with `nothing` if that's the case. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. It then loops through the temperatures to determine the trend, which is initially assumed to be `:stable`. If it finds a consistent increase or decrease but then encounters a deviation from this pattern, it marks the trend as `:stable`. Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the calculated average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the determined trend.","status":200,"tokens":[178,351],"elapsed":25.31782025,"_type":"aimessage"}]
