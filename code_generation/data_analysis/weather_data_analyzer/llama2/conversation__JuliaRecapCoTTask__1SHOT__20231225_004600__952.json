[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task:\n\t* `Statistics` package for statistical analysis\n\t* `nothing` type for indicating missing values\n\t* 1-based indexing for array slicing and tuples\n\t* General type annotations to avoid being too restrictive\n2. Solve the Task:\n\tI will write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that takes in a list of temperature data `temps`. The function will perform statistical analyses on the data using the `Statistics` package, and return the results in a named tuple. The named tuple will have four fields: `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`. If the list is empty, the function will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n3.
