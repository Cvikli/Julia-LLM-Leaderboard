X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

As a world-class Julia language programmer, I will follow a systematic approach to solving this problem. Here are the steps I will take:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `Statistics` package for statistical analysis\n\t* `nothing` type for handling missing values\n\t* 1-based indexing for arrays and slicing\n\t* Anonymous functions for one-liner code\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Use `Statistics.mean()` to calculate the average temperature\n\t* Use `Statistics.max()` to find the maximum temperature\n\t* Use `Statistics.min()` to find the minimum temperature\n\t* Use `nothing` as a sentinel value for missing data\n\t* Calculate the trend using the following criteria:\n\t\t+ `:increasing`: if the majority of temperatures are increasing\n\t\t+ `:decreasing`: if the majority of temperatures are decreasing\n\t\t+ `:stable`: if the temperature patterns are relatively stable\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the average, maximum, minimum, and trend values are reasonable and consistent with the input data\n\t* Use visualization tools such as `PyPlot` or `Glance` to inspect the distribution of temperatures and identify any outliers or patterns\n4. Return the results in a named tuple:\n\t* Construct the named tuple using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax\n\t* Set the keys and values based on the results from the statistical analyses\n\nNow, let me proceed with the task based on the provided instructions.
