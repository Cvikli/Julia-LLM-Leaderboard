Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"First, let's write the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    stats = mean(temps), minimum(temps), maximum(temps)\n    trend = _determine_trend(temps)\n\n    (; average=stats[1], max=stats[2], min=stats[3], trend)\nend\n\nfunction _determine_trend(temps::AbstractVector)\n    last_value = temps[end]\n    diff = last_value - temps[begin]\n    if diff > 0\n        :increasing\n    elseif diff < 0\n        :decreasing\n    else\n        :stable\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of temperatures as its argument, checks for an empty list, and returns a named tuple with the average, max, min temperatures, and trend.
