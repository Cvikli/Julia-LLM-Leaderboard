Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem, I'll follow the given steps:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n   - Define a function named `weather_data_analyzer` that takes one argument (a list of daily temperature data).\n   - Import necessary packages (Statistics in this case).\n   - Perform statistical analyses on the given temperature data and calculate average, max, min temperatures.\n   - Determine the trend based on the differences between consecutive temperatures.\n\n2.
