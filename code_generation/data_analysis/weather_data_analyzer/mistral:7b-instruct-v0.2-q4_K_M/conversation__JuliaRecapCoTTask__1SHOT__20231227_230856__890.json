X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\nThe function `weather_data_analyzer` correctly imports the Statistics package and defines a named tuple with the given keys. It handles empty lists by returning an initialised named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. The statistical analyses are performed using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the Statistics package. Finally, it calculates the trend based on the difference between the first and last elements in the input array, and sets the `trend` value accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[464,432],"elapsed":19.999680291,"_type":"aimessage"}]
