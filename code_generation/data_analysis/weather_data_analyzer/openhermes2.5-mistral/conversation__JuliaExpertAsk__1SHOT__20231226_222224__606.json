Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia function that performs statistical analyses on the daily temperature data:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(temps) == 1\n            trend = :stable\n        elseif all(x -> x == temps[1], temps)\n            trend = :stable\n        elseif avg > max_temp\n            trend = :increasing\n        else\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n        \n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the input list `temps` is empty. If it's empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature using the `mean()` function from the `Statistics` package, the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum()` and `minimum()` functions respectively.\n\nThe trend is determined based on the conditions specified in the code. If the list has only one element, the trend is considered stable. If all elements are equal to the first element in the list, the trend is also stable. If the average temperature is greater than the maximum temperature, the trend is increasing. Otherwise, the trend is decreasing.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[204,390],"elapsed":12.879444,"_type":"aimessage"}]
