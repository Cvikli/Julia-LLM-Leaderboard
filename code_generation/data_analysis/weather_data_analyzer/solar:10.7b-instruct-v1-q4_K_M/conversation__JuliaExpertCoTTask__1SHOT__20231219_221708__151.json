Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's follow our systematic approach to solving this problem.\n\nStep 1: Think through our approach step by step\n\n* Analyze the input data `weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])` and identify the task at hand.\n* Determine the statistical analyses we need to perform on the data (in this case, we want to calculate the average, maximum, minimum, and trend of the temperatures).\n* Decide on the appropriate functions and packages to use in R for these analyses (in this case, we will use the `Statistics` package).\n\nStep 2: Write any functions and other code we need\n\n* Create a function `weather_data_analyzer()` that takes a list of temperature values as input and performs the necessary statistical analyses.\n* Use the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, minimum, and trend of the temperatures in the list.\n\nStep 3: Solve the task\n\n* Call the `weather_data_analyzer()` function with the input data `weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])`.\n* The function will return a named tuple containing the calculated values for average, maximum, minimum, and trend.\n\nStep 4: Check that our solution is correct\n\n* Verify that the returned values are correct based on the input data. In this case, we expect the average temperature to be around 21 (i.e., (25 + 27 + 23 + 20 + 22) / 5), the maximum temperature to be 27, the minimum temperature to be 20, and the trend to be `:stable`.\n\nWith this approach, we have successfully solved the task at hand! Here is the complete code for the `weather_data_analyzer()` function:\n```R\nweather_data_analyzer <- function(temps) {\n  # Calculate average temperature\n  avg <- mean(temps)\n  \n  # Calculate maximum temperature\n  max <- max(temps)\n  \n  # Calculate minimum temperature\n  min <- min(temps)\n  \n  # Calculate trend (stability of temperatures)\n  trend <- ifelse(max - min == 0, \":stable\", ifelse(max > min, \":increasing\", \":decreasing\"))\n  \n  # Return results in named tuple\n  return(list(average = avg, max = max, min = min, trend = trend))\n}\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[1,613],"elapsed":22.076778417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
