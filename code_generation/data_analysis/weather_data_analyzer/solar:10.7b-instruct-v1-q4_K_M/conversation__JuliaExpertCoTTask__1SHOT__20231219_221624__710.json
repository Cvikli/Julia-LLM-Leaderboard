Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started.\n\nFirst, I will follow the problem-solving steps you provided:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n\t* Identify the task at hand: analyze daily temperature data and return statistical results in a named tuple.\n\t* Determine the input parameters: list of daily temperature data `temps`.\n\t* Decide on the statistical analyses to perform: average, maximum, minimum, and trend.\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\t* Use the `Statistics` package to perform the statistical analyses.\n\t* Create a named tuple to return the results.\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Analyze the input data using the `Statistics` package and create a named tuple containing the results.\n\t* If the list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the returned named tuple contains the expected statistical results for the input data.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given data `weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])`.\n\nFirst, I will use the `Statistics` package to perform the statistical analyses:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\n# Perform statistical analyses on input data\naverage <- mean(temps)\nmax_temp <- maximum(temps)\nmin_temp <- minimum(temps)\ntrend <- identify_trend(temps)\n\n# Create a named tuple to return results\nresult := (; average=average, max_ temp=max_temp, min_temp=min_temp, trend=trend)\n```\nNext, I will check that my solution is correct:\n```julia\n# Verify that results are as expected\n@assert result.average == 21 # Should be equal to the mean of input data\n@assert result.max_temp == 27 # Should be equal to the maximum value in input data\n@assert result.min_temp == 20 # Should be equal to the minimum value in input data\n@assert result.trend == \":increasing\" # Should be equal to the trend identified by `identify_trend()`\n```\nFinally, I will return the named tuple containing the results:\n```julia\nreturn result\n```\nAnd that's it! The function `weather_data_analyzer` should now return the statistical results for the input data.","status":200,"tokens":[280,569],"elapsed":22.5699155,"_type":"aimessage"}]
