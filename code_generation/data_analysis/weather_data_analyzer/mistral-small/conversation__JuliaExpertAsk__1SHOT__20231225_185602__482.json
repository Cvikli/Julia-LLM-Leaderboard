Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a function that meets the requirements:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    trend = begin\n        if isempty(temps)\n            nothing\n        else\n            diff = diff(sort(temps))\n            diff[1] > 0 ? :increasing :\n            diff[end] < 0 ? :decreasing :\n            :stable\n        end\n    end\n\n    return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function calculates the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures using the `mean`, `minimum`, and `maximum` functions from the `Statistics` package.
