Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"I will follow the problem-solving steps as described:\n\n1. Think through the approach step by step:\n   - Calculate average, max, and min temperatures using `Statistics` package functions.\n   - Determine the trend by comparing the first and last elements in the list.\n\n2. Write necessary functions and code:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    else\n        avg = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n        if temps[1] < temps[end]\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n            trend = :decreasing\n        else\n            trend = :stable\n        end\n\n        return (average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\n    end\nend\n```\n\n3.
