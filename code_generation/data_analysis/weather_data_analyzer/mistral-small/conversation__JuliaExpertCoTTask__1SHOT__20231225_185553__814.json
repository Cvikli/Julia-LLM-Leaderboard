Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather\\_data\\_analyzer(temps)\n    # Think through your approach step by step\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate average, max, and min temperatures\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate trend based on temperature differences\n    trends = Dict(:increasing => true, :decreasing => true, :stable => true)\n    diff_prev = diff(temps)\n    for i in 2:length(diff_prev)\n        trends[:increasing] &= (diff_prev[i] >= 0)\n        trends[:decreasing] &= (diff_prev[i] <= 0)\n    end\n    trend = first(filter(x -> x[2], trends))[1]\n\n    # Return results in a named tuple\n    return (average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Test the function with the provided data\nprintln(weather\\_data\\_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22]))\n```\n\nThe `weather_data_analyzer` function first checks if the list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` in that case.

The `trend` is calculated based on temperature differences using a dictionary with boolean values to check if the temperatures are increasing, decreasing, or stable throughout the list. Finally, the function returns the results in a named tuple.","status":200,"tokens":[295,433],"elapsed":6.03781075,"_type":"aimessage"}]
