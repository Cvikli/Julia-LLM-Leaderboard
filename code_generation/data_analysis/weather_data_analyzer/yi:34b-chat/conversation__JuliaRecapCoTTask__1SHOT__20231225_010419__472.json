[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

Checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all fields set to `nothing`.\n2. Calculates the average temperature using `mean()` from the `Statistics` package.\n3. Finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum()` and `minimum()`, respectively, also from the `Statistics` package.\n4. Determines the trend by checking if the temperatures are increasing or decreasing. If there is no clear pattern, the trend is set to `:stable`.\n5. The function returns a named tuple with the calculated average, maximum, minimum, and trend.\n\nThe function uses a conditional statement to check if the list has more than one element, as it's necessary to determine the trend. If there's only one temperature value, no trend can be inferred, so the default is `:stable`.\n\n# Additional Notes\n\n- The function assumes that the input `temps` is a vector of numbers.\n- It uses the `Statistics` package for calculating the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.\n- The trend determination is a simple check based on the temperature differences between consecutive elements. More sophisticated methods could be used if more complex analyses are required (e.g., linear regression or moving averages).\n- The function does not rely on any specific package for trend analysis to keep it as general as possible.\n- The `nothing` values in the returned named tuple indicate that no statistical information can be provided for an empty list or a list with only one element when determining the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[472,587],"elapsed":90.161450666,"_type":"aimessage"}]
