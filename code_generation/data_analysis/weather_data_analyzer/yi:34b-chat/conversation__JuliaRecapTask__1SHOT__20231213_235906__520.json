Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).

I'm happy to help you solve this problem using the Julia language. Here are the steps I will follow:\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\nI will recall relevant Julia snippets that can be used to perform statistical analyses on the temperature data. These may include functions from the `Statistics` package, such as `mean`, `median`, `stddev`, and others.\n2. Solve the Task:\nI will use these recalled functions to analyze the temperature data and calculate the desired statistics. I will also handle any edge cases or errors that may arise during the analysis.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\nOnce I have generated the named tuple containing the results of the statistical analyses, I will double-check that the values are correct and that the trend is correctly identified.\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\nI understand that you prefer to use the standard Julia libraries and avoid creating new packages unless explicitly requested. I will keep this in mind while solving the task. Additionally, I will use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to avoid being too restrictive and emphasize performance, clarity, and abstract types whenever possible.\n\nIf you provide any special instructions, I will prioritize them over the guidelines provided above.
