Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"# Solution\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = if avg == min_temp || avg == max_temp\n        if avg > temp for temp in temps\n            :decreasing\n        else\n            :increasing\n        end\n    elseif avg < max_temp && avg > min_temp\n        :stable\n    else\n        error(\"Unexpected situation.

For a non-empty list, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures and determines the trend based on whether the average is equal to the minimum or maximum temperature or if the temperature seems to be increasing or decreasing in between those extremes.","status":200,"tokens":[290,337],"elapsed":72.935925208,"_type":"aimessage"}]
