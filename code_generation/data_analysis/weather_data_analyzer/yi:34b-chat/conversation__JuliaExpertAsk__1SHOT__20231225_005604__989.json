If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If there is data, it calculates the mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures using functions from the `Statistics` package. To determine the trend, we use the median difference between successive pairs of temperatures as an approximation for the derivative of the linear regression line. The sign of this median difference compared to the mean temperature indicates whether the data is increasing or decreasing on average. If the median difference is zero (or close to it), the trend is considered stable.","status":200,"tokens":[198,354],"elapsed":50.454656333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
