If it is, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nIf the list is not empty, the function calculates the average temperature using `mean()`, the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum()` and `minimum()`, respectively. It then calculates the standard deviation to assess the spread of the data, which we'll use to determine the trend.\n\nThe trend is determined based on whether the standard deviation is zero (the data is stable), or if the difference between the average and the maximum/minimum temperature suggests an increasing or decreasing trend.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple with the calculated `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and the `trend`.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```julia\ntemps = [10, 20, 30, 40] # Example list of daily temperature data\nweather_stats = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprintln(\"Average temperature: \", weather_stats.average)\nprintln(\"Maximum temperature: \", weather_stats.max)\nprintln(\"Minimum temperature: \", weather_stats.min)\nprintln(\"Temperature trend: \", weather_stats.trend)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nAverage temperature: 25.0\nMaximum temperature: 40.0\nMinimum temperature: 10.0\nTemperature trend: increasing\n```\n\nRemember that the `trend` value is determined based on the standard deviation and can only be `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`. If the data shows no variation (zero standard deviation), it's considered stable; if the maximum temperature is higher than the average, the trend is considered increasing; otherwise, if the minimum temperature is lower than the average, the trend is considered decreasing.","status":200,"tokens":[156,664],"elapsed":90.774535333,"_type":"aimessage"}]
