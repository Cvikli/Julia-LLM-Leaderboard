Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n    \n    avg = mean(temps)\n    maxT = maximum(temps)\n    minT = minimum(temps)\n    trend = if avg > 0.95*maxT || avg < 0.05*minT\n        :decreasing\n    elseif maxT - minT < 10 && abs(avg - (maxT + minT)/2) < 3\n        :stable\n    else\n        :increasing\n    end\n    \n    return (average = avg, max = maxT, min = minT, trend = trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list of temperatures is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average temperature using `mean` from the `Statistics` package, finds the maximum and minimum temperatures using `maximum` and `minimum` respectively, also from the `Statistics` package. Then it determines the trend based on whether the average is close to the maximum or minimum, indicating a significant change in temperature over time (decreasing), if the range between the maximum and minimum is small and the average is close to their midpoint (stable), or if there is a clear difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures (increasing). Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values for average, maximum, minimum, and trend.","status":200,"tokens":[198,354],"elapsed":50.491224625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
