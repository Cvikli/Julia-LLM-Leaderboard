Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the code that solves the problem:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Number})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average = nothing, max = nothing, min = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    trend = ifelse(max_temp > avg, :increasing, ifelse(min_temp < avg, :decreasing, :stable))\n\n    return (; average = avg, max = max_temp, min = min_temp, trend = trend)\nend\n```\nExplanation:\n\nThe function takes a vector of numbers as input and returns a named tuple with the analyzed data. If the input vector is empty, all values in the returned tuple are set to `nothing`. Otherwise, the function calculates the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) based on the input data.\n\nThe `Statistics` package provides several functions for calculating statistical measures such as `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum`. The `ifelse` statement is used to determine the trend based on whether the maximum temperature is greater than the average temperature or not, and whether the minimum temperature is less than the average temperature or not.\n\nNote that the `;` at the beginning of the return statement is used to create a named tuple with labeled fields. The field names are provided in the parentheses after the function name.","status":200,"tokens":[0,364],"elapsed":10.128495238,"_type":"aimessage"}]
