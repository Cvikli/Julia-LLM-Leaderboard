Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

I defined the `weather_data_analyzer` function, which takes in a vector of temperatures as input and returns a named tuple with information about the temperature data. The named tuple contains four elements: `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.\n2. I checked if the length of the `temps` vector is zero. If it is, I return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. This ensures that the function returns a consistent type even when the input is empty.\n3. I calculated the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n4. I defined a helper function called `get_trend` that calculates the trend of the temperature data based on the first two elements of the vector. The function uses polynomial regression to determine whether the temperatures are increasing, decreasing, or stable.\n5. I called the `get_trend` function with the first two elements of the `temps` vector as input and assigned the result to the `trend` variable in the named tuple.\n6. Finally, I returned the named tuple containing information about the temperature data.\n\nNote that I used the `@` symbol to denote a function argument type annotation. This is a Julia syntax for specifying the expected type of an argument passed to a function. In this case, I specified that the `temps` vector should be a vector of numbers (`<:Number`).","status":200,"tokens":[0,612],"elapsed":17.313322169,"_type":"aimessage"}]
