Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function using the `Statistics` package:\n```\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        trend = :stable\n        if all(isless.(diff(temps), 0))\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(isgreater.(diff(temps), 0))\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n    else\n        trend = nothing\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max, min, trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n\nNext, the function checks if there are at least two elements in the input list. If there are, it uses the `diff` function to calculate the differences between consecutive temperatures, and then checks if all of these differences are less than 0 (indicating an increasing trend), or all greater than 0 (indicating a decreasing trend). If neither of these conditions is true, the trend is considered stable. Otherwise, it sets the `trend` field to `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable` accordingly.\n\nFinally, the function returns a named tuple containing the calculated values for `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[184,430],"elapsed":12.214137839,"_type":"aimessage"}]
