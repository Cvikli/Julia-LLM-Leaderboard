Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":[],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you can implement the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n```\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{<:Real})\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    trend = :stable\n\n    if length(temps) > 1\n        trend = ifelse(max == temps[1], :increasing,\n                       ifelse(min == temps[end], :decreasing, :stable))\n    end\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n* The `using Statistics` line imports the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n* The function takes a vector of temperatures as input, which is assumed to be a list of real numbers (i.e., floats or integers).\n* If the input vector is empty, the function returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. This is done using the `isempty` function, which checks if a container (such as an array) is empty.\n* Otherwise, the function calculates the average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature using the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package.\n* If there are at least two temperatures in the input vector, the function determines the trend of the data by checking if the maximum temperature is equal to the first temperature, or if the minimum temperature is equal to the last temperature. If both conditions are true, the trend is set to `:stable`. Otherwise, it is set to either `:increasing` or `:decreasing`, depending on which condition is true.\n* Finally, the function returns a named tuple containing the `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend` values. The named tuple is constructed using the `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax, where `key1`, `key2`, etc. are the keys of the named tuple (i.e., the field names), and `value1`, `value2`, etc. are the values associated with each key.\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input vector is a list of temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit, but you can modify it to work with any other unit of measurement by adjusting the `mean`, `maximum`, and `minimum` functions accordingly.","status":200,"tokens":[0,606],"elapsed":17.000392485,"_type":"aimessage"}]
