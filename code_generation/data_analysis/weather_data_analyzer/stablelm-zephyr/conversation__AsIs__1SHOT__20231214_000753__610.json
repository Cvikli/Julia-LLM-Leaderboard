Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package).

Here's an example implementation of a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on a list of daily temperature data using the `Statistics` package in R:\n```r\n# Load the Statistics package\nlibrary(Statistics)\n\n# Define the function to perform the analysis\nweather_data_analyzer <- function(temps) {\n  # Calculate the average temperature\n  avg_temp <- mean(temps)\n  \n  # Calculate the maximum temperature\n  max_temp <- max(temps)\n  \n  # Calculate the minimum temperature\n  min_temp <- min(temps)\n  \n  # Determine the trend in temperatures (increasing, decreasing, or stable)\n  trend <- sign(correlation(temps))[1]\n  \n  # Return a named tuple with the calculated values\n  return((; avg_temp=avg_temp, max_temp=max_temp, min_temp=min_temp, trend=trend))\n}\n\n# Example usage of the function\ntemps <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\nresult <- weather_data_analyzer(temps)\nprint(result) # prints a named tuple with the calculated values\n```\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It loads the `Statistics` package to access the functions for statistical analysis.\n2. It defines the function `weather_data_analyzer`, which takes a list of daily temperature data as input.\n3. It calculates the average temperature using the `mean()` function.\n4. It calculates the maximum temperature using the `max()` function.\n5. It calculates the minimum temperature using the `min()` function.\n6. It determines the trend in temperatures using the `correlation()` function, which returns a vector of correlation coefficients. The trend is then determined based on the sign of the correlation coefficient (increasing, decreasing, or stable).\n7. Finally, it returns a named tuple with the calculated values using the `return()` function.\n\nNote that the `correlation()` function assumes that the input data is continuous and normally distributed, so you may need to check the assumptions of this function before relying on its results. Additionally, the `sign()` function is used to determine the trend based on the sign of the correlation coefficient, which can be negative, positive, or zero.","status":200,"tokens":[138,544],"elapsed":19.483258667,"_type":"aimessage"}]
