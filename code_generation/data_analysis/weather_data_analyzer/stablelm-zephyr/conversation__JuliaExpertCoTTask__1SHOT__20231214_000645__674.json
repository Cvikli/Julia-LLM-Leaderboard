Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started.\n\nTo solve this task, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Think through our approach step by step:\n\t* Check if the list is empty or not\n\t* Calculate the average temperature\n\t* Find the maximum and minimum temperatures\n\t* Determine the trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable)\n2. Write any functions and other code we need:\n\t* Use the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures\n\t* Check if the list is empty or not using the `isempty` function\n\t* Create a named tuple to store the results\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* If the list is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\t* Otherwise, calculate and store the average temperature in the `average` field of the named tuple.\n\t* Find the maximum temperature and store it in the `max` field of the named tuple.\n\t* Find the minimum temperature and store it in the `min` field of the named tuple.\n\t* Determine the trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) based on the distribution of temperatures and store it in the `trend` field of the named tuple.\n4. Check that our solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the average temperature is within the range of values in the list.\n\t* Verify that the maximum temperature is greater than or equal to the minimum temperature.\n\t* Verify that the trend is consistent with the distribution of temperatures.\n\nHere is the implemented function `weather_data_analyzer`:\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(vens)\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate average temperature\n    avg = mean(vens)\n    \n    # Find maximum and minimum temperatures\n    max = maximum(vens)\n    min = minimum(vens)\n    \n    # Determine trend\n    trend = determine_trend(vens)\n    \n    # Create named tuple\n    result = (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\n    \n    return result\nend\n\n# Helper function to determine trend\nfunction determine_trend(temps)\n    # Check if list is empty\n    if isempty(vens)\n        return \":increasing\"\n    end\n    \n    # Determine trend based on distribution of temperatures\n    if all(x -> x > prev(vens), temps)\n        return \":increasing\"\n    elseif any(x -> x < prev(vens), temps)\n        return \":decreasing\"\n    else\n        return \":stable\"\n    end\nend\n```\nNote that we use the `isempty` function to check if the list is empty, and the `mean` function to calculate the average temperature. We also use the `maximum` and `minimum` functions to find the maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively. Finally, we use the `determine_trend` function to determine the trend based on the distribution of temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[280,717],"elapsed":28.497751958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
