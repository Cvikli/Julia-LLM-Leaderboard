Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a Julia function that performs the statistical analysis on the daily temperature data and returns the results in a named tuple:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Float64})\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    avg = Statistics.mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=:stable)\n    end\n\n    temps_sorted = sort(temps)\n    diff = diff(temps_sorted)\n    sign = sign.(diff)\n    same_sign_count = sum(sign .== 1)\n    total_count = length(temps)\n\n    if same_sign_count > total_count / 2\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif same_sign_count < total_count / 2\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nThis function takes a vector of daily temperature data and checks if it's empty. If so, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures using the `Statistics` package. It then checks whether the list has only one unique value in which case it deems the trend as `:stable`. For longer lists, it sorts the temperatures in ascending order, calculates the difference between consecutive values, determines their sign, counts the number of times the sign is positive (which represents an increasing trend) and compares it with half of the total count to determine the overall trend.\n\nYou can call this function by providing a list of temperature data as an argument:\n```julia\ntemps = [32.0, 35.4, 31.2, 33.6, 36.0, 34.8]\nresult = weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n```","status":200,"tokens":[206,537],"elapsed":17.619383625,"_type":"aimessage"}]
