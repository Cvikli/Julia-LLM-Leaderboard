X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Based on the given problem statement and special instructions, here's how I would approach this task using Julia:\n\n1. Recall Julia snippets:\n   - Use `Statistics` package for statistical analyses.\n   - Define a named tuple using the syntax `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)`.\n   - Handle empty lists by returning a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n2. Solve the Task:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    isempty(temps) && return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n\n    # Perform statistical analyses on the data\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine temperature trend based on the difference between max and min temperatures\n    delta = max_temp - min_temp\n    (delta > 0.0 ? :increasing : (delta < 0.0 ? :decreasing : :stable))\n\n    # Return a named tuple containing the results\n    (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend)\nend\n```\n\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n   - The `weather_data_analyzer` function checks if the input list is empty and returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n   - It then performs statistical analyses using the `Statistics` package, determines the temperature trend based on the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures, and finally returns a named tuple containing the average, max, min temperatures, and the temperature trend.","status":200,"tokens":[464,405],"elapsed":15.217616166,"_type":"aimessage"}]
