Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"To solve the problem, I'll follow the given problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n   - First, check if the input list is empty and return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing` if it is.\n   - Otherwise, import the required `Statistics` package and perform the necessary statistical analyses (average, max, min) on the given temperature data using appropriate functions from the package.\n   - Determine the trend by comparing the first and last elements in the list and considering their order.\n\n2.

Check that my solution is correct:\n\nThe given code correctly identifies the average, maximum, minimum temperature values and determines if the temperature trend is increasing, decreasing or stable based on the provided input data. This matches the expected behavior of the `weather_data_analyzer` function.","status":200,"tokens":[293,439],"elapsed":16.0615415,"_type":"aimessage"}]
