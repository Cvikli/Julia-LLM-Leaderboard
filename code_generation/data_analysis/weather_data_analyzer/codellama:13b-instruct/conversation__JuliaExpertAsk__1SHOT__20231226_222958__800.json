Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the implementation of `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{T}) where T<:Real\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    diffs = [t - avg for t in temps]\n    if all(diff -> diff > 0, diffs)\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif all(diff -> diff < 0, diffs)\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    return (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the input `temps` vector is empty. If it is not empty, then it calculates the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the trend of the temperatures (i.e., whether they are increasing or decreasing). The trend is determined by checking if all differences between each temperature and the average temperature are positive (increasing), negative (decreasing), or zero (stable). Finally, it returns a named tuple containing the results. If the input `temps` vector is empty, then it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[201,337],"elapsed":19.777761416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
