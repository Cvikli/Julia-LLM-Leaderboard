Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started.\n\nBased on the task provided, I will follow these steps to write a function `weather_data_analyzer`:\n\n1. Think through my approach step by step:\n\t* Identify the input data (list of daily temperature values)\n\t* Determine the statistical analyses to perform (average, maximum, minimum, trend)\n\t* Decide on the output format (named tuple with key-value pairs)\n2. Write any functions and other code I need:\n\t* Use `Statistics` package to perform the required statistical analyses\n\t* Create a named tuple to store the results\n3. Solve the task:\n\t* Implement the function `weather_data_analyzer` using the approach outlined above\n\t* Test the function with sample input data to ensure it produces correct output\n4. Check that my solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the function returns the expected results for various input data sets\n\t* Make sure the output format and content are as expected\n\nHere's the implemented function `weather_data_analyzer`:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temperatures)\n    # Check if input is empty or invalid\n    if length(temperatures) == 0 || any(isnothing(temperatures))\n        return (; nothing = \"Input data cannot be empty or contain nothing values\")\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate average temperature\n    avg_temp = mean(temperatures)\n    \n    # Find maximum temperature\n    max_temp = maximum(temperatures)\n    \n    # Find minimum temperature\n    min_temp = minimum(temperatures)\n    \n    # Determine trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable)\n    trend = is_trending(temperatures)\n    \n    # Create named tuple with results\n    return (; average=avg_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Helper function to check if input data is increasing, decreasing, or stable\nfunction is_trending(temperatures)\n    # Check for increasing trend\n    if all(temperatures .> previous(temperatures))\n        return \":increasing\"\n    \n    # Check for decreasing trend\n    elseif all(temperatures .< previous(temperatures))\n        return \":decreasing\"\n    \n    # Check for stable trend\n    else\n        return \":stable\"\nend\n```\nIn this implementation, we first check if the input data is empty or invalid. If it is, we return an error message. Otherwise, we calculate the average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and determine the trend (increasing, decreasing, or stable) using `is_trending` function. Finally, we create a named tuple with the results and return it.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!","status":200,"tokens":[1,667],"elapsed":24.128749375,"_type":"aimessage"}]
