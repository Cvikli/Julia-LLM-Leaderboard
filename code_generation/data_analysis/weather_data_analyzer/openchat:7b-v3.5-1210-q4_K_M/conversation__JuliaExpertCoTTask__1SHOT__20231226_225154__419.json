Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the Julia code for solving this problem.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector{Int})\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=:stable)\n    end\n\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)\n    \n    if isempty(temps) || all(x -> x == avg, temps)\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[1] < avg && temps[end] > avg\n        trend = :increasing\n    else\n        trend = :decreasing\n    end\n\n    return (; average=avg, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nNow, let's test it with the provided data:\n\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\n```","status":200,"tokens":[302,261],"elapsed":17.854765416,"_type":"aimessage"}]
