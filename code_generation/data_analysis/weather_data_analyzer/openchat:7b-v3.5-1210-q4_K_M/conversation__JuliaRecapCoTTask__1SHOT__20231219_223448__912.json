[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! Let's get started on solving the task at hand. Based on the information provided, I will follow these problem-solving steps:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `Statistics` package for statistical analysis\n\t* `nothing` type for indicating missing values\n\t* 1-based indexing in Julia (unlike Python)\n\t* Multiple dispatch for function arguments with different types\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Use `Statistics` to calculate the average, maximum, minimum temperatures in the list\n\t* Determine the trend of temperature changes (using a simple moving average or other methods)\n\t* Return the results in a named tuple with key-value pairs\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the calculated temperatures are reasonable and make sense for the given data\n\t* Ensure that the trend analysis is accurate and meaningful based on the provided data\n\nNow, let's move on to the task at hand.
