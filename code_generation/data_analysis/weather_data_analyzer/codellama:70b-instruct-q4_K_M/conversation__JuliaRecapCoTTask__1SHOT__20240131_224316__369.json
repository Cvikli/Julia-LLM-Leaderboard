[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Julia code for the above task. The special instruction is incorporated in the code below. Please note that it's a good practice to write comments and use descriptive variable names. This makes your code more readable and understandable by others.\n\n```julia-repl\nusing Statistics # Import Statistics package for statistical analysis\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps) \n    if isempty(temps) return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing); end # Check if the list is empty and return a named tuple with all values set to nothing.\n    avg = mean(temps)   # Calculate average temperature using Statistics package's `mean` function. \n    mx = maximum(temps) # Find max temperature in the list. \n    mn = minimum(temps) # Find min temperature in the list. \n    if temps[1] < temps[end] return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=:increasing); end   # If the first element is less than last, then it means temperatures are increasing over time. \n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end] return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=:decreasing); end # Otherwise, if first temperature is greater than last, it's decreasing over time. \n    else return (; average=avg, max=mx, min=mn, trend=:stable); end # If the temperatures are not increasing or decreasing, they must be stable.\nend\n```\n\nThis function will calculate and return the statistical data for a given list of daily temperature data `temps` as a named tuple. If the list is empty, it will return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. \n\nThe code follows general good programming practices: clear variable names, use of comments, and consistent formatting. The function is also flexible, as it can be easily extended to handle other tasks or special instructions.","status":200,"tokens":[0,449],"elapsed":24.459842509,"_type":"aimessage"}]
