Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This is how I would approach this problem in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Include the Statistics package for analysis.\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::AbstractVector{<:Real})::NamedTuple\n    average = mean(temps)\n    min, max = extrema(temps)\n    trend = :stable  # Default value in case the list is empty or there's only one value.\n    \n    if length(temps) >= 2\n        if all(x -> x > 0, diff(temps))\n            trend = :increasing\n        elseif all(x -> x < 0, diff(temps))\n            trend = :decreasing\n        end\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=average, min=min, max=max, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function will analyze the daily temperature data and provide statistical information on its average, maximum, minimum values, as well as a prediction of the trend based on the differences between consecutive temperatures.","status":200,"tokens":[0,238],"elapsed":12.787502081,"_type":"aimessage"}]
