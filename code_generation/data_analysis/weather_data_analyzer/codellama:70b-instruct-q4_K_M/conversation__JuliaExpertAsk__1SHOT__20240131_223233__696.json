Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"This function takes in an array of daily temperature data and returns various statistical analysis results on this data. The function uses Julia's Statistics package to calculate the mean, maximum, minimum, and trend of the temperatures. It then constructs a named tuple containing these statistics and returns it. If the input array is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n```Julia\nusing Statistics  # Import the Statistics package for statistical analysis\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{Int64})  # Define the function that takes in an array of daily temperature data\n    if length(temps) == 0   # If the input array is empty, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    mean_temp = mean(temps)  # Calculate the mean temperature using Statistics.mean()\n    max_temp = maximum(temps)  # Calculate the maximum temperature using Base.maximum()\n    min_temp = minimum(temps)  # Calculate the minimum temperature using Base.minimum()\n    \n    if temps[end] > temps[1]   # If the last temperature is greater than the first, set trend to :increasing\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]  # If the last temperature is less than the first, set trend to :decreasing\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else   # Otherwise, if the last temperature is equal to the first, set trend to :stable\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=mean_temp, max=max_temp, min=min_temp, trend=trend)  # Return a named tuple containing the statistical analysis results\nend\n```","status":200,"tokens":[0,428],"elapsed":23.02702846,"_type":"aimessage"}]
