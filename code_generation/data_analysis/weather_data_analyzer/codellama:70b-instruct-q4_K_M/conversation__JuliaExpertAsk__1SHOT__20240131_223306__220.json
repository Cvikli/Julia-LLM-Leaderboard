Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's an example of how you could write this function in Julia using the Statistics package:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend based on the first and last temperature readings.\n    if temps[1] < temps[end]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[1] > temps[end]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n*   We first check if the `temps` list is empty. If it is, we return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n*   If the list is not empty, we calculate the average temperature using `mean(temps)`, the maximum temperature using `maximum(temps)`, and the minimum temperature using `minimum(temps)`.\n*   Next, we determine the trend by comparing the first (i.e., `temps[1]`) and last (i.e., `temps[end]`) values in the list. If the first value is less than the last, we set the trend to `:increasing`. If it's greater, we set it to `:decreasing`. If they are equal, we set it to `:stable`.\n*   Finally, we return a named tuple containing all the computed values: `average`, `max`, `min`, and `trend`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,408],"elapsed":21.932896691,"_type":"aimessage"}]
