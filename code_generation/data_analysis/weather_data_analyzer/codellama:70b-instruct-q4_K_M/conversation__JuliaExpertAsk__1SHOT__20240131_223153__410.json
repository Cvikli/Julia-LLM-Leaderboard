Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"```julia-repl\nusing Statistics\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    average = mean(temps)\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    if temps[end] > temps[1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[end] < temps[1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    return (; average, max, min, trend)\nend\n```\n\nIn this function:\n*   We import the Statistics package to use its functions for calculating statistics.\n*   The function takes a list of daily temperature data `temps`.\n*   If the length of the list is zero, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.
