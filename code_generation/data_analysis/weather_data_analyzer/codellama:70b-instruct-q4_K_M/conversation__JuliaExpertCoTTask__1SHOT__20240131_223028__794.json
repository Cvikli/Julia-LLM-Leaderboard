Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is the code that satisfies the requirements of the task and data provided.\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics # Importing the Statistics package for statistical analysis\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Vector)\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate the average temperature\n    avg = mean(temps)\n\n    # Find the maximum and minimum temperatures\n    maxtemp = maximum(temps)\n    mintemp = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Determine the trend of the temperatures\n    if length(temps) == 1\n        trend = :stable\n    elseif temps[length(temps)] > temps[length(temps)-1]\n        trend = :increasing\n    elseif temps[length(temps)] < temps[length(temps)-1]\n        trend = :decreasing\n    else\n        trend = :stable\n    end\n\n    # Construct a named tuple with the results and return it\n    return (; average=avg, max=maxtemp, min=mintemp, trend=trend)\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = weather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nThe `weather_data_analyzer` function takes a vector of temperatures as an input. It uses the Statistics package to compute the mean, maximum and minimum values. The trend is determined by comparing the last two elements in the list, if there are at least 2 elements in it. If there's only one element or no elements, then the trend is assumed to be stable.\n\nThe function returns a named tuple containing the average, max, min and trend values. If the input vector is empty, all values are set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[0,442],"elapsed":23.94583387,"_type":"aimessage"}]
