[{"content":"You are a world-class Julia language programmer and have a very systematic approach to solving problems.\n\nProblem Solving Steps:\n- Recall Julia snippets that will be useful for this Task\n- Solve the Task\n- Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nReminder on Julia Language:\n- Key Syntax: variables `x = 10`, control structures `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\nNone.\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"1. Import the `Statistics` package for statistical calculations\n2. Define the `weather_data_analyzer` function that takes a list of daily temperature data as input\n3. Check if the input is empty; if so, return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. If not, continue:\n4. Use the `Statistics.mean`, `Statistics.maximum`, and `Statistics.minimum` functions to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, respectively.\n5. Define a variable called `difference_in_temps` as the difference between the maximum temperature (`max`) and the minimum temperature (`min`).\n6. Based on the value of `difference_in_temps`, determine the trend:\n    * If it's greater than zero, set `trend = :increasing`\n    * If it's less than zero, set `trend = :decreasing`\n    * If it's equal to zero, set `trend = :stable`\n7.
