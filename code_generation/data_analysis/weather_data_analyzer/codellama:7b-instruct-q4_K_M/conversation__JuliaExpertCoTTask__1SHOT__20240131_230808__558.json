Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's the code for the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n\n    # Calculate the average temperature\n    average = mean(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the maximum and minimum temperatures\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n\n    # Calculate the trend of the data (increasing, decreasing, or stable)\n    trend = ifelse(average > 20, :increasing, ifelse(average < 20, :decreasing, :stable))\n\n    return (; average=average, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function first checks if the list `temps` is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n2. The function then calculates the average temperature using the `mean` function from the `Statistics` package.\n3. Next, the function calculates the maximum and minimum temperatures using the `maximum` and `minimum` functions from the `Statistics` package, respectively.\n4. Finally, the function calculates the trend of the data based on the average temperature (increasing, decreasing, or stable). The `ifelse` function is used to make this calculation.\n5. The named tuple containing the results is returned from the function.","status":200,"tokens":[0,373],"elapsed":3.135975501,"_type":"aimessage"}]
