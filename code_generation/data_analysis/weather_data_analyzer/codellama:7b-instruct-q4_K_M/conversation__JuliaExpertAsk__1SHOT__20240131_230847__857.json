Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here's a possible implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    if isempty(temps)\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    # Calculate the average temperature\n    average = mean(temps)\n    # Find the maximum and minimum temperatures\n    max = maximum(temps)\n    min = minimum(temps)\n    # Check if the trend is increasing, decreasing, or stable\n    trend = :stable\n    if length(temps) > 2\n        trend = :increasing\n        for i in 2:length(temps)-1\n            if temps[i] < temps[i-1] || temps[i] > temps[i+1]\n                trend = :decreasing\n                break\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    # Return the results as a named tuple\n    return (; average, max, min, trend)\nend\n```\nThis function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the average, maximum, minimum, and trend of the temperature data using the `mean`, `maximum`, `minimum`, and `trend` functions from the `Statistics` package. Finally, it returns the results as a named tuple.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the list of temperatures is sorted in ascending order (i.e., from lowest to highest). If the temperatures are not sorted, you may need to sort them before calculating the trend.","status":200,"tokens":[0,380],"elapsed":3.232610506,"_type":"aimessage"}]
