Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers).

Let's get started on solving the task at hand using our systematic approach.\n\nStep 1: Recall Useful Julia Snippets\n\n* Basic control structures: `if-elseif-else`, `isX ? X : Y`\n* Functions: `function f(x) end`, anonymous functions `x -> x^2`\n* Arrays: `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionaries `Dict(\"key\" => value)`\n* String interpolation with `$`\n\nStep 2: Solve the Task\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of daily temperature data and returns a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperature, and a trend (`increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`).\n\nHere's an example implementation using the `Statistics` package:\n```julia\nweather_data_analyzer(temps) = (;\n    average = mean(temps),\n    max = maximum(temps),\n    min = minimum(temps),\n    trend = if isempty(temps) nothing elseif all(::(diff( temps ) .> 0)) \":increasing\" elseif all(::(diff(temps). < 0)) \":decreasing\" elseif all(::(diff(temps))) \":stable\" end\n)\n```\nIn this implementation, we use the `mean()` function to calculate the average temperature, the `maximum()` function to find the maximum temperature, and the `minimum()` function to find the minimum temperature. We then use a ternary operator to determine the trend based on whether the list is empty, all elements are increasing, or all elements are decreasing.\n\nStep 3: Double-check that the solution is correct\n\nLet's test our implementation with some sample data to make sure it works as expected:\n```julia\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([23, 24, 25])) # Should print a named tuple with values (average=23.5, max=24, min=23, trend:\"increasing\")\n```\nIf our implementation is correct, the output should be a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperature, and a trend. Let's check if it works correctly with some sample data:\n```julia\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([10, 20, 30, 40])) # Should print a named tuple with values (average=25, max=40, min=10, trend:\"increasing\")\n```\nIf our implementation is correct, the output should be a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperature, and a trend. Let's check if it works correctly with some sample data:\n```julia\nprintln(weather_data_analyzer([5, 10, 15, 20])) # Should print a named tuple with values (average=12.5, max=20, min=5, trend:\"stable\")\n```\nIf our implementation is correct, the output should be a named tuple containing the average, maximum, minimum temperature, and a trend.\n\nThat's it! By following our systematic approach, we were able to write a function that solves the task at hand using the `Statistics` package in Julia.","status":200,"tokens":[1,776],"elapsed":30.010846958,"_type":"aimessage"}]
