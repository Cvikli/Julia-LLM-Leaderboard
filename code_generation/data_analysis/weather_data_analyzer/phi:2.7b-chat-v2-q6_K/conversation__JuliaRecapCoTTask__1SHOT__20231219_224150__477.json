X : Y`, `for`, `while`; functions `function f(x) end`, anonymous `x -> x^2`, arrays `[1, 2, 3]`, slicing `a[1:2]`, tuples `(1, 2)`, namedtuples `(; name=\"Julia\", )`, dictionary `Dict(\"key\" => value)`, `$` for string interpolation. \n- Prefer Julia standard libraries, avoid new packages unless explicitly requested. \n- Use general type annotations like `Number` or `AbstractString` to not be too restrictive. Emphasize performance, clarity, abstract types unless specific for multiple dispatch on different types.\n- Reserved names: `begin`, `end`, `function`. \n- Distinguished from Python with 1-based indexing, multiple dispatch\n\nIf the user provides any Special Instructions, prioritize them over the above guidelines.\n  ","variables":[],"_type":"systemmessage"},{"content":"# Task\n\nYou are given a list of daily temperature data `temps` (numbers). Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Special Instructions\n\n{{instructions}}\n","variables":["task","instructions"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Great! I'm ready to help you solve this problem using Julia. Based on the information provided, here are the steps I will follow:\n\n1. Recall useful Julia snippets:\n\t* `Statistics` package for statistical analysis\n\t* `nothing` type for representing missing values\n\t* `if-elseif-else` control structures for handling multiple conditions\n\t* `for` loop for iterating over a list\n\t* `while` loop for repeating a block of code while a condition is true\n\t* ` anonymous function` for creating functions without a name\n\t* `slicing` for extracting subarrays\n\t* `namedtuples` for constructing named tuples\n\t* `dictionaries` for storing key-value pairs\n2. Solve the task:\n\t* Use the `Statistics` package to calculate the average, maximum, minimum, and trend of the temperature data.\n\t* Return the results in a named tuple using the `(; key1=value1, key2=value2)` syntax.\n3. Double-check that the solution is correct:\n\t* Verify that the calculation of the average, maximum, minimum, and trend are correct.\n\t* Make sure that the trend is correctly identified as `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`.\n4. Implement the function:\n```julia\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Calculate average temperature\n    avg = Statistics.mean(temps)\n    \n    # Calculate maximum temperature\n    max = maximize( temps )\n    \n    # Calculate minimum temperature\n    min = minimize( temps )\n    \n    # Calculate trend\n    trend = nothing\n    \n    # Check if list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return nothing\n    end\n    \n    # Return named tuple with results\n    return (; average=avg, maximum=max, minimum=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nNote that I have used the `Statistics` package to perform statistical analysis on the temperature data. This package provides a variety of functions for calculating central tendency, variability, and other statistical measures. I have also used the `nothing` type to represent missing values, as suggested in the special instructions.\n\nI hope this helps!
