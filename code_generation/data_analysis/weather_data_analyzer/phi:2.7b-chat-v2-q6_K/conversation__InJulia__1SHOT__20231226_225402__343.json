The player has to make decisions based on the weather data (average temperatures and trends) provided by your AI. Here's how it works:\n\n1. If the average temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius, the plant growth rate increases, but if the trend indicates increasing temperatures for more than 2 days in a row, the water resources will become scarce.\n2. If there are no rain and the trend indicates decreasing temperatures for more than 3 days in a row, snowstorms start to happen.\n3. If the average temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius, then it's too cold for animals to survive, but if the trend shows stable or increasing temperatures over multiple days, you can expect that some wildlife species may migrate back.\n4. The player must adapt their strategies based on these weather data and AI recommendations.\n\nQuestion: Using `weather_data_analyzer` function, how would you predict what might happen in your game's world?\n\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the average temperature from our list of daily temperatures using the `weather_data_analyzer` function. For instance, let's say our list is [15, 16, 18, 19, 17]. The output should be `('average', 16)`. \n\nNext, analyze the trend in temperatures. In this case, it increases from day to day so our trend would be `increasing`. \n\nIf the average temperature is above 20 degrees and the trend is increasing for more than 2 days, we can expect the plant growth rate will increase but the water resources may become scarce due to climate change or drought.\n\nIf there are no rain (which could happen if the trend is not clear from our sample data) and the average temperature drops below 10 degrees Celsius, then snowstorms might start because of freezing conditions in colder months.\n\nFinally, if the average temperature does not meet either of these conditions and the trend shows stable or increasing temperatures over multiple days, it means that some wildlife species may migrate back to their original habitat.\nAnswer: Based on the output from `weather_data_analyzer` function (average: 16, Trend: Increasing), we can predict the following weather events in our game's world - increased plant growth rate but potential scarcity of water resources due to increasing temperatures, a possibility of snowstorms if there is no rain and average temperature drops below 10 degrees Celsius, and the migration back of some wildlife species.","status":200,"tokens":[150,767],"elapsed":21.023100959,"_type":"aimessage"}]
