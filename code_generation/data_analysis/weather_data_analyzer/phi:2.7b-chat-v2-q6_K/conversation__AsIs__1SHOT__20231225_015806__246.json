We know that the trend is either increasing, decreasing or stable. \n\nImagine you are a Business Intelligence Analyst who uses this tool to analyze weather data for your company's outdoor event planning business. You have three days of temperature records for an upcoming event in Miami: Day 1 has temperatures `[25, 26, 27]`, Day 2 has temperatures `[26, 25, 24]` and Day 3 has temperatures `[27, 29, 30]`.\n\nThe task is to analyze these data with the WeatherDataAnalyzer named tuple and make a decision for the event planning. Here are the rules:\n\n1. If the trend of temperatures over three days is stable (i.e., either all increasing or decreasing), it's safe to proceed with the outdoor event. Otherwise, move it indoors.\n2. For each day, if the average temperature and max temperature are above `27` degrees Celsius, it's also safe to proceed with an outdoor event on that day. If not, consider moving the event indoors for that day too.\n3. The event can only be moved outdoors if all days have a stable trend and their temperatures meet safety conditions (average > 27 and max > 27).\n\nQuestion: Should you move the event indoors or proceed with it based on the three-day temperature analysis?\n\n\nWe need to apply deductive logic, tree of thought reasoning, and proof by exhaustion.\n\nFirst, let's use deductive logic to analyze each day's trend. For Day 1, temperatures are increasing (26 > 25). For Day 2, they're decreasing (24 < 26). For Day 3, again the trend is increasing (30 > 29). This indicates that all three days have different trends.\n\nNext, let's use tree of thought reasoning to consider each condition for an outdoor event separately: average temperature and max temperature. On Day 1, both conditions are met (25 + 26 + 27)/3 = 26 > 27 and the max temperature is 27. However, on Day 2, only average (26 + 25 + 24)/3 = 25.67 < 27 but the max temperature is 26 which is safe. For Day 3, all conditions for outdoor event are satisfied as both average and max temperatures (27+29+30)/3 > 27 and 30>27.\n\nFinally, using proof by exhaustion, we need to check if all three days have a stable trend AND if all the conditions are met. We already found that all trends over three days are not stable. So, this condition is violated for an outdoor event. Hence, we cannot proceed with an outdoor event based on these data.\nAnswer: The event should be moved indoors.","status":200,"tokens":[147,952],"elapsed":26.403771,"_type":"aimessage"}]
