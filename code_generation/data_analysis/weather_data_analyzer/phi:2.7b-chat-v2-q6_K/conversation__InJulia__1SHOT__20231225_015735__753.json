However, the data was encrypted and you were given a set of randomly shuffled temperature values. Your task is to decrypt the original temperatures by reversing the steps used to encrypt them.\n\nHere's what we know:\n1) The encryption process used `analyze_weather` function from Julia which returns an array of namedtuples with average, maximum, minimum and a trend.\n2) The trend in the encrypted data can be only one out of three possibilities: increasing (`\"increasing\"`), decreasing (`\"decreasing\"`) or stable (`\"stable\"`). \n3) To decrypt the temperatures, you need to reverse the process used for encryption. You do this by first extracting the namedtuple returned from `analyze_weather`, then calculating average, maximum and minimum from these values. Finally, check the trend to understand the sequence of temperature changes.\n\nQuestion: Given an encrypted list of temperatures using `analyze_weather` function where the trend is \"increasing\", what would be the decrypted form?\n\n\nTo solve this puzzle, you need to follow these steps:\n Extract namedtuple from result of `analyze_weather`.\n Calculate average, maximum and minimum values. \n Check if the sequence of temperature changes indicates an increasing or decreasing trend.\n If the sequence is increasing, then the decrypted temperatures would be in ascending order. If they are decreasing, the temps would be in descending order. If it's stable, the values should not change.\n Return a list of decrypted temperatures. \n\n\nFirst extract namedtuple from result of `analyze_weather`:\n```\ndecrypted = analyze_weather(encrypted_temps);\n```\nNext, calculate average, maximum and minimum values:\n```\navg_temp = decrypted.average;\nmax_temp = decrypted.max;\nmin_temp = decrypted.min;\n```\nFinally, check the trend:\n```\nif decrypted.trend == \"increasing\" then\n    return [min_temp, avg_temp, max_temp];\nelse if decrypted.trend == \"decreasing\" then\n    return [max_temp, avg_temp, min_temp];\nelse\n    return [];\nend\n```\nAnswer: The list of decrypted temperatures is given by the result from step 3 above. This will give you the original sequence of daily temperature data.","status":200,"tokens":[150,793],"elapsed":21.71295925,"_type":"aimessage"}]
