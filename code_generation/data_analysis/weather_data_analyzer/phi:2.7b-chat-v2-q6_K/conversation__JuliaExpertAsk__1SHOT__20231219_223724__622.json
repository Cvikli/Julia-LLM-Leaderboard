Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Certainly! Here's an example implementation of the `weather_data_analyzer` function in Julia:\n```julia\nusing Statistics\n\nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps)\n    # Calculate the average temperature\n    avg = mean(temps)\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum temperature\n    max = max(temps)\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum temperature\n    min = min(temps)\n    \n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (; average=nothing, max=nothing, min=nothing, trend=nothing)\n    end\n    \n    # Calculate the trend\n    if diff( temps ) > 0\n        trend = \":increasing\"\n    elseif diff(temps) < 0\n        trend = \":decreasing\"\n    else\n        trend = \":stable\"\n    end\n    \n    return (; average=avg, max=max, min=min, trend=trend)\nend\n```\nThis function uses the `mean` and `max` functions from the `Statistics` package to calculate the average and maximum temperatures, respectively. It also uses the `min` function to calculate the minimum temperature. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates the trend of the temperatures by checking if the difference between consecutive temperatures is positive, negative, or zero. If the difference is positive, the trend is `:increasing`, otherwise it's `:decreasing` or `:stable`.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.","status":200,"tokens":[1,377],"elapsed":12.6206115,"_type":"aimessage"}]
