If the array is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the average temperature (mean), maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and trend (if there are more than one days, it compares the first day temperature with the last day).","status":200,"tokens":[163,373],"elapsed":64.521924584,"_type":"aimessage"}]
