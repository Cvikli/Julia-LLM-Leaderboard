Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","variables":["ask"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Here is a solution in Julia:\n\n```julia\nusing Statistics \nfunction weather_data_analyzer(temps::Array{Float64,1})\n    if length(temps) == 0\n        return (average = nothing, maximum = nothing, minimum = nothing, trend = nothing)\n    else\n        average_temp = mean(temps)\n        max_temp = maximum(temps)\n        min_temp = minimum(temps)\n        \n        if length(temps) == 1 \n            return (average = average_temp, maximum = max_temp, minimum = min_temp, trend = :stable)\n        else\n            differences = [temps[i] - temps[i-1] for i in 2:length(temps)]\n            \n            if all(d > 0 for d in differences)\n                return (average = average_temp, maximum = max_temp, minimum = min_temp, trend = :increasing)\n            elseif all(d < 0 for d in differences)\n                return (average = average_temp, maximum = max_temp, minimum = min_temp, trend = :decreasing)\n            else \n                return (average = average_temp, maximum = max_temp, minimum = min_temp, trend = :stable)\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the array is empty. If it's not, then we compute the mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. For the `trend`, we check the difference between each consecutive temperature pair. If all these differences are positive, we say that the trend is increasing; if they are all negative, we say the trend is decreasing; otherwise, we declare it as stable.","status":200,"tokens":[204,401],"elapsed":70.041375167,"_type":"aimessage"}]
