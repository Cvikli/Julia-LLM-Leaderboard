Write a function `weather_data_analyzer` that performs statistical analyses on this data (use `Statistics` package). The function should return results in named tuple (construct it with `(; key1=value1,key2=value2)` syntax) containing the `average`, `max`, `min` temperatures, and a `trend` (can be only: `:increasing`, `:decreasing`, or `:stable`). If the list is empty, the function should return a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.\n\n\n\n# Data\n\nweather_data_analyzer([25, 27, 23, 20, 22])","variables":["task","data"],"_type":"usermessage"},{"content":"Sure!

The `weather_data_analyzer` function returns a named tuple with the average, maximum, minimum, and trend of the daily temperature data. If the list is empty, it returns a named tuple with all values set to `nothing`.","status":200,"tokens":[280,450],"elapsed":18.002381417,"_type":"aimessage"}]
